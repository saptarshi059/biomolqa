The adenosine A2B receptor, also known as ADORA2B, is a G-protein coupled adenosine receptor, and also denotes the human adenosine A2b receptor gene which encodes it.


== Mechanism ==
This integral membrane protein stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of adenosine. This protein also interacts with netrin-1, which is involved in axon elongation.


== Gene ==
The gene is located near the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17.


== Ligands ==
Research into selective A2B ligands has lagged somewhat behind the development of ligands for the other three adenosine receptor subtypes, but a number of A2B-selective compounds have now been developed, and research into their potential therapeutic applications is ongoing.
