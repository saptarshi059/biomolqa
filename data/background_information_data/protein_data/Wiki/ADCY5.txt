Adenylyl cyclase type 5 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ADCY5 gene.
The human ADCY5 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 and codes for the enzyme Adenylyl Cyclase 5 (AC5). This membrane protein has catalytic activity to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the brain, this enzyme is highly expressed in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum. It is also found in non-neuronal cells such as cardiomyocytes and pancreatic islets. AC5 plays a role in several physiological processes including the modulation of neuronal activity particularly in the striatum, thus variants in ADCY5 gene typically lead to movement disorders.
