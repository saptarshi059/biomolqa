The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4, also known as the cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 4 (CHRM4), is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the  CHRM4 gene.


== Function ==
M4 muscarinic receptors are coupled to Gi/o heterotrimeric proteins.
They function as inhibitory autoreceptors for acetylcholine. Activation of M4 receptors inhibits acetylcholine release in the striatum. The M2 subtype of acetylcholine receptor functions similarly as an inhibitory autoreceptor to acetylcholine release, albeit functioning actively primarily in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors possess a regulatory effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission. Activation of M4 receptors in the striatum inhibit D1-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. M4 receptor-deficient mice exhibit increased locomotor simulation in response to D1 agonists, amphetamine and cocaine. Neurotransmission in the striatum influences extrapyramidal motor control, thus alterations in M4 activity may contribute to conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
The M4 muscarinic receptor has been found to be a regulator of erythroid progenitor cell differentiation. Inhibition of the M4 muscarinic receptor provides therapeutic benefits in myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia.
