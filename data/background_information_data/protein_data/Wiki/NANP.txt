 N-acylneuraminate + phosphate
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds.  The systematic name is N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include acylneuraminate 9-phosphatase, N-acylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate phosphatase, and N-acylneuraminic (sialic) acid 9-phosphatase.  This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
