Gelsolin is an actin-binding protein that is a key regulator of actin filament assembly and disassembly. Gelsolin is one of the most potent members of the actin-severing gelsolin/villin superfamily, as it severs with nearly 100% efficiency.
Cellular gelsolin, found within the cytosol and mitochondria, has a closely related secreted form, Plasma gelsolin, that contains an additional 24 AA N-terminal extension. Plasma gelsolin's ability to sever actin filaments helps the body recover from disease and injury that leaks cellular actin into the blood. Additionally it plays important roles in host innate immunity, activating macrophages and localizing of inflammation.
