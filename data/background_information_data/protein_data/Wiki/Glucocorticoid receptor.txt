The glucocorticoid receptor (GR or GCR) also known by its gene name NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1) is the steroid receptor for glucocorticoids such as cortisol.
The GR is expressed in almost every cell in the body and regulates genes controlling the development, metabolism, inflammation, and immune response.  Because the receptor gene is expressed in several forms, it has many different (pleiotropic) effects in different parts of the body and in the context of different diseases.
GR is a steroid receptor and thus it's cannonical action is similar to other steroid receptors. The unbound receptor resides in the cytosol of the cell. When glucocorticoids bind to the receptor, GR translocates to the nucleus of the cell where it acts as a transcription factor. The activated GR complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus or represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol (by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus). 
In humans, the GR protein is encoded by NR3C1  gene which is located on chromosome 5 (5q31).
