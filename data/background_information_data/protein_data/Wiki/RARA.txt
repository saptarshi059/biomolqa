Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-Î±), also known as NR1B1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group B, member 1), is a nuclear receptor that in humans is encoded by the RARA gene.
NR1B1 is a gene with a protein product and has a chromosomal location of 17q21.2. RARA codes for the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic acid receptor, alpha subtype, a transcription factor. There are another two subtypes of RARs: beta and gamma subtypes.
