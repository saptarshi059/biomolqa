The Ferrari F8 (Type F142MFL) is a mid-engine sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. The car is the successor to the Ferrari 488 and pays homage to the last 45 years of Ferrari’s mid-engine V8s. It was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show.


== Variants ==


=== F8 Tributo ===


==== Specifications and performance ====
The F8 Tributo uses the same engine from the 488 Pista, a 3.9 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine with a power output of 530 kW; 710 hp (720 PS) at 8000 rpm and 770 N⋅m (568 lb⋅ft) of torque at 3250 rpm, making it the most powerful V8-powered Ferrari produced to date. The exhaust layout and the Inconel manifolds have been completely modified up to the terminals. The F8 Tributo utilizes rev sensors, originally developed for the 488 Challenge, to optimize turbocharger efficiency based on power demand from the pedal. It uses a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with enhanced gear ratios.
Several new software features are installed on the F8 which are controlled via the manettino dial on the steering wheel. The car is equipped with Ferrari's latest Side Slip Angle Control traction- and stability-control program. Additionally, the Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer, an electronic program for managing drifts, can now be used in the Race drive mode. Ferrari also stated that the Tributo's downforce has been increased by 15 percent as compared to the 488 GTB.
Claimed manufacturer performance for the F8 Tributo is 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.9 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 7.6 seconds, with a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph). Road & Track tested a US-spec Ferrari F8 Tributo model and achieved an 10.3-second quarter-mile time with a 132.8 mph (214 km/h) trap speed, which equates to 0–100 km/h in the mid-3 range and 0–200 km/h in the low-10 range.


==== Aerodynamics ====
The car has quad tail lamps, a feature that was last seen in the V8 lineage on the F430. At the rear, it has a louvered clear engine cover made from lightweight Lexan.

The Spider's drivetrain is shared with the Tributo. Performance figures include acceleration from 0 - 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.9 seconds and from 0 - 200 km/h (120 mph) in 8.2 seconds. Top speed is unchanged from the coupé at 340 km/h (210 mph). Dry weight of the Spider is 1,400 kg (3,086 lb).

=== SP-8 ===

The Ferrari SP-8 is a one-off sports car based on a Ferrari F8 Spider and built for a Taiwanese customer. The SP-8 inherits the same layout, chassis and engine from the F8 Spider but opting for a roadster format (entirely without a roof).

It has F40-inspired five-spoke alloy wheels; rear lights derived from the Roma and the windscreen and exhaust pipes “given the same treatment as the 296 GTB’s”. The front half of the car is painted in glossy iridescent Blue Sandstone carbon fiber, while the rear bodywork is finished in a matte Argento Micalizzato gray paint.
