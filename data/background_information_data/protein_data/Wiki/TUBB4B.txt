Tubulin beta-4B chain formerly known as tubulin beta-2C chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TUBB4B gene. It is thought that this protein could determine which hand is dominant in humans due to variations of the TUBB4B gene, which cause the protein to form microtubules that form cilia which direct fluids asymmetrically during development.
