Histamine H1 receptor; In peripheral tissues, the H1 subclass of histamine receptors mediates the contraction of smooth muscles, increase in capillary permeability due to contraction of terminal venules, and catecholamine release from adrenal medulla, as well as mediating neurotransmission in the central nervous system.
Understanding the physiology and genetics of human hypoxia tolerance has important medical implications, but this phenomenon has thus far only been investigated in high-altitude human populations. Another system, yet to be explored, is humans who engage in breath-hold diving. The indigenous Bajau people ("Sea Nomads") of Southeast Asia live a subsistence lifestyle based on breath-hold diving and are renowned for their extraordinary breath-holding abilities. However, it is unknown whether this has a genetic basis. Using a comparative genomic study, we show that natural selection on genetic variants in the PDE10A gene have increased spleen size in the Bajau, providing them with a larger reservoir of oxygenated red blood cells. We also find evidence of strong selection specific to the Bajau on BDKRB2, a gene affecting the human diving reflex. Thus, the Bajau, and possibly other diving populations, provide a new opportunity to study human adaptation to hypoxia tolerance. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
BACKGROUND: Angioedema is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis). Research suggests that susceptibility to ACEi-induced angioedema (ACEi-AE) involves both genetic and nongenetic risk factors. Genome- and exome-wide studies of ACEi-AE have identified the first genetic risk loci. However, understanding of the underlying pathophysiology remains limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify further genetic factors of ACEi-AE to eventually gain a deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. METHODS: By combining data from 8 cohorts, a genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed in more than 1000 European patients with ACEi-AE. Secondary bioinformatic analyses were conducted to fine-map associated loci, identify relevant genes and pathways, and assess the genetic overlap between ACEi-AE and other traits. Finally, an exploratory cross-ancestry analysis was performed to assess shared genetic factors in European and African-American patients with ACEi-AE. RESULTS: Three genome-wide significant risk loci were identified. One of these, located on chromosome 20q11.22, has not been implicated previously in ACEi-AE. Integrative secondary analyses highlighted previously reported genes (BDKRB2 [bradykinin receptor B2] and F5 [coagulation factor 5]) as well as biologically plausible novel candidate genes (PROCR [protein C receptor] and EDEM2 [endoplasmic reticulum degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 2]). Lead variants at the risk loci were found with similar effect sizes and directions in an African-American cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The present results contributed to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of ACEi-AE by (1) providing further evidence for the involvement of bradykinin signaling and coagulation pathways and (2) suggesting, for the first time, the involvement of the fibrinolysis pathway in this adverse drug reaction. An exploratory cross-ancestry comparison implicated the relevance of the associated risk loci across diverse ancestries.
Gene-environment interactions are implicated in congenital disorders. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to develop animal models of human disease, which are the product of defined gene-environment interactions. Work from our laboratory demonstrates the presence of genetic interactions between the bradykinin B2 receptor (BdkrB2) and the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the developing kidney. Our studies have shown that the Bdkrb2(-/-) embryos exposed to gestational salt stress develop renal dysgenesis. The underlying mechanism is p53 stabilization and mediated apoptosis and repression of the terminal epithelial differentiation program. We also uncovered a novel functional cross-talk between p53 and BdkrB2. Thus, while BdkrB2 is a target for p53-mediated transcriptional activation, BdkrB2 inactivation results in the upregulation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) levels, thus potentiating phosphorylation of p53 on Ser23 by Chk1, an essential step in the pathway leading to renal dysgenesis in salt-stressed BdkrB2(-/-) mutant mice. Future studies will now focus on defining how this G-protein-coupled receptor is coupled to the activation of p53, a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in more than 50% of all human cancers.
Preeclampsia is one of the most frequent and severe complications of pregnancy. Symptoms of preeclampsia usually occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy and include hypertension and kidney dysfunction with proteinuria. Up to now, delivery of the infant has been the most effective and life-saving treatment to alleviate symptoms of preeclampsia because a causative treatment does not exist, which could prolong a pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a complex medical condition, which is attributed to a variety of different risk factors and causes. Risk factors account for insufficient placentation and impaired vasculogenesis and finally culminate in this life-threatening condition of pregnancy. Despite progress, many pathomechanisms and causes of preeclampsia are still incompletely understood. In recent years, it was found that excessive protein complex formation between G-protein-coupled receptors is a common sign of preeclampsia. Specifically, the aberrant heteromerization of two vasoactive G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the angiotensin II AT1 receptor and the bradykinin B2 receptor, is a causative factor of preeclampsia symptoms. Based on this knowledge, inhibition of abnormal GPCR protein complex formation is an experimental treatment approach of preeclampsia. This review summarizes the impact of pathological GPCR protein aggregation on symptoms of preeclampsia and delineates potential new therapeutic targets.
The bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2) plays a key role in the inflammation process of osteoarthritis. Nitric oxide has also long been considered to be a catabolic factor that contributes to inflammatory response and the osteoarthritis disease pathology. Several studies have reported that the BDKRB2 +9/-9 bp polymorphisms are associated with transcription of the receptor. However, the roles of BDKRB2 polymorphisms in inflammation in osteoarthritis remain unclear. This study enrolled 156 subjects with primary knee osteoarthritis and 58 healthy volunteers. BDKRB2 polymorphisms were genotyped, and the mRNA and protein levels of BDKRB2 in synovial tissues from osteoarthritis patients were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Nitric oxide production in serum from patients with osteoarthritis was measured using a nitric oxide assay kit. We found that the mean BDKRB2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in Kallgren-Lawrence grade-4 osteoarthritis patients than patients with lower grade osteoarthritis. The +9/-9 bp polymorphisms significantly affected the BDKRB2 mRNA and protein expression levels in synovial tissues from osteoarthritis subjects. Osteoarthritis patients with +9/-9 and -9/-9 genotypes had higher BDKRB2 expression levels in synovial tissue and nitric oxide production in serum. Moreover, positive correlation was found between the BDKRB2 levels in synovial tissue and nitric oxide production. Compared with health controls, significant increases of nitric oxide production in osteoarthritis were detected which were associated with increasing severity of osteoarthritis. Multiple linear regression analysis (adjusted for gender and age) showed serum nitric oxide level was positively associated with BDKRB2 polymorphism and Kallgren-Lawrence grade and was inversely associated with obesity. Our findings showed that the BDKRB2 +9/-9 bp polymorphisms affected the gene expression and nitric oxide production, which were associated with radiographic severity of osteoarthritis, suggesting that the BDKRB2 +9/ -9 bp polymorphisms may act as a genetic modulator of osteoarthritis, and play an essential role in inflammatory process in osteoarthritis.
Bradykinin receptor B2 (BDKRB2) has been reported as an oncogene in several malignancies. In glioma, the role of BDKRB2 remains unknown. This study aimed at investigating its clinical significance and biological function in glioma at the transcriptional level. We selected 301 glioma patients with microarray data from CGGA database and 697 with RNAseq data from TCGA database. Transcriptome and clinical data of 998 samples were analyzed. Statistical analysis and figure generating were performed with R language. BDKRB2 expression showed a positive correlation with the WHO grade of glioma. BDKRB2 was increased in IDH wildtype and mesenchymal subtype of glioma. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that BDKRB2 was profoundly associated with extracellular matrix organization in glioma. GSEA analysis revealed that BDKRB2 was particularly correlated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GSVA analysis showed that BDKRB2 was significantly paralleled with several EMT signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, hypoxia, and TGF-beta. Moreover, BDKRB2 expression was significantly correlated with key biomarkers of EMT, especially with N-cadherin, snail, slug, vimentin, TWIST1, and TWIST2. Finally, higher BDKRB2 indicated significantly shorter survival for glioma patients. In conclusion, BDKRB2 was associated with more aggressive phenotypes of gliomas. Furthermore, BDKRB2 was involved in the EMT process and could serve as an independent prognosticator in glioma.
Neto, SLdA, Herrera, JJB, Rosa, TS, de Almeida, SS, Silva, GCB, Ferreira, CES, dos Santos, MAP, Silvino, VO, de Melo, GF. Interaction between ACTN3 (R577X), ACE (I/D), and BDKRB2 (-9/+9) polymorphisms and endurance phenotypes in Brazilian long-distance swimmers. J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1591-1595, 2022-This study investigated the interactions between the polymorphisms ACTN3 (R577X), ACE (I/D), and BDKRB2 (-9/+9) and their association with endurance phenotypes in Brazilian long-distance swimmers. Twenty-six volunteers (aged 18-30 years) were divided into 2 groups as follows: 19 subelite athletes formed the pool swimming experts (PSE: 400-1500 m) group and 7 elite athletes the open water swimming experts (OWSE: 5-25 km) group. ACTN3 (R577X), ACE (I/D), and BDKRB2 (-9/+9) polymorphisms were genotyped through polymerase chain reaction. A nonathletes control (CON) group derived from studies with the Brazilian population was created. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X2) was observed in all groups. The total genotype score (TGS) associated with endurance phenotypes was used in this study. A significance level was established at p </= 0.05. PSE and CON groups had very similar genotyping distribution. The OWSE group had a greater frequency for the genotypes XX (57.1%), ID (57.1%), and the alleles X (71.4%) and I (57.2%) than CON and PSE groups (XX = 21.1 and 21.1%; ID = 47.1 and 52.6% [p > 0.05]; X = 44.0 and 42.1%; I = 45.3 and 42.1%, respectively). Considering BDKRB2, OWSE and PSE groups had a greater frequency of +9/+9 than the CON group (42.9% and 31.6 vs. 27.5%, respectively). Although the expected genotypic distribution was not verified among athletes, the TGS revealed small supremacy of 3-5 typical alleles in the OWSE group (54.8 +/- 26.7%) compared with the PSE group (41.2 +/- 17.8%) (p = 0.072; confidence interval = 95%; effect size = 0.95). The OWSE group seem to have benefited from the best genotype profile verified for ACTN3 and ACE. However, the results of this work should be approached with caution because of the small number of athletes and polymorphisms assessed.
KEY POINTS: The mechanisms responsible for the high inter-individual variability in blood pressure responses to exercise remain unclear. Common genetic variants of genes related to the vascular transduction of sympathetic outflow have been investigated, but variants influencing skeletal muscle afferent feedback during exercise have not been explored. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TRPV1 rs222747 and BDKRB2 rs1799722 receptors present in skeletal muscle were associated with differences in the magnitude of the blood pressure response to static handgrip exercise but not mental stress. The combined effects of TRPV1 rs222747 and BDKRB2 rs1799722 on blood pressure and heart rate responses during exercise were additive, and primarily found in men. Genetic differences in skeletal muscle metaboreceptors may be a risk factor for exaggerated blood pressure responses to exercise. ABSTRACT: Exercise blood pressure (BP) responses demonstrate high inter-individual variability, which could relate to differences in metabolically sensitive afferent feedback from the exercising muscle. We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding metaboreceptors present in group III/IV skeletal muscle afferents can influence the exercise pressor response. Two hundred men and women underwent measurements of continuous BP and heart rate at baseline and during 2 min of static handgrip exercise (30% maximal volitional contraction), post-exercise circulatory occlusion and mental stress (serial subtraction; internal control). Participants were genotyped for SNPs in TRPV1 (rs222747; G/C), ASIC3 (rs2288645; G/A), BDKRB2 (rs1799722; C/T), PTGER2 (rs17197; A/G) and P2RX4 (rs25644; A/G). Exercise systolic BP (19 +/- 10 vs. 22 +/- 10 mmHg, P = 0.03) was lower in GG versus GC/CC minor allele carriers for TRPV1 rs222747, while exercise diastolic BP (14 +/- 7 vs. 17 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0.007) and heart rate (12 +/- 8 vs. 15 +/- 9 beats min(-1) , P = 0.03) were lower in CC versus CT/TT minor allele carriers for BDKRB2 rs1799722. Individuals carrying both minor alleles for TRPV1 rs222747 and BDKRB2 rs1799722 had greater systolic (22 +/- 11 vs. 17 +/- 10 mmHg, P = 0.04) and diastolic (18 +/- 7 vs. 14 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0.01) BP responses than those with no minor alleles; these differences were larger in men. No differences in BP or heart rate responses were detected during static handgrip with ASIC3 rs2288645, PTGER2 rs17197 or P2RX4 rs25644. None of the selected SNPs were associated with differences during mental stress. These findings demonstrate that variants in TRPV1 and BDKRB2 receptors can contribute to BP differences during static exercise in an additive manner.
It is currently unknown which genetic polymorphisms are involved in substance use disorder (SUD) comorbid with bipolar disorder (BD). The research on polymorphisms in BD comorbid with SUD (BD + SUD) is summarized in this systematic review. We looked for case-control studies that genetically compared adults and adolescents with BD and SUD, healthy controls, and BD without SUD. PRISMA was used to create our protocol, which is PROSPERO-registered (identification: CRD4221270818). The following bibliographic databases were searched indefinitely until December 2021 to identify potentially relevant articles: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. This systematic review, after the qualitative analysis of the study selection, included 17 eligible articles. In the selected studies, 66 polymorphisms in 29 genes were investigated. The present work delivers a group of potentially valuable genetic polymorphisms associated with BD + SUD: rs11600996 (ARNTL), rs228642/rs228682/rs2640909 (PER3), PONQ192R (PON1), rs945032 (BDKRB2), rs1131339 (NR4A3), and rs6971 (TSPO). It is important to note that none of those findings have been confirmed by two or more studies; thus, we believe that all the polymorphisms identified in this review require additional evidence to be confirmed.
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common complication of orthopedic surgery. Genetic risk factors and high heritability carried a substantial risk of DVT. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential association in the Han Chinese population between the polymorphisms of BDKRB2 and KNG1 and DVT after orthopedic surgery (DVTAOS). A total of 3,010 study subjects comprising 892 DVT cases and 2,118 controls were included in the study, and 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in total (30 for BDKRB2 and 9 for KNG1) were chosen for genotyping. Two SNPs, rs710446 (OR = 1.27, P = 0.00016) and rs2069588 (OR = 1.29, P = 0.00056), were identified as significantly associated with DVTAOS. After adjusting for BMI, the significance of rs2069588 decreased (P = 0.0013). Haplotype analyses showed that an LD block containing rs2069588 significantly correlated with the DVTAOS risk. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis indicated that hsa-miR-758-5p and BDKRB2 formed miRNA/SNP target duplexes if the rs2069588 allele was in the T form, suggesting that rs2069588 may alter BDKRB2 expression by affecting hsa-miR-758-5p/single-nucleotide polymorphism target duplexes. Our results demonstrate additional evidence supporting that there is an important role for the KNG1 and BDKRB2 genes in the increased susceptibility of DVTAOS.
Imbalance of collagen I expression results in severe pathologies. Apart from activation by the TGFbeta-receptor/Smad pathway, control of collagen I expression remains poorly understood. Here, we used human dermal fibroblasts expressing a mCherry fluorescent protein driven by endogenous COL1A1 promoter to functionally screen the kinome and phosphatome. We identify 8 negative regulators, revealing that collagen is under tonic repression. The cell surface receptor BDKRB2 represses collagen I and other pro-fibrotic genes. Interestingly, it also promotes other basal membrane ECM genes. This function is independent of the natural ligand, bradykinin, and of SMAD2/3 factors, instead requiring constant ERK1/2 repression. TGFbeta stimulation induces rapid BDKRB2 transcriptional downregulation. Human fibrotic fibroblasts have reduced BDKRB2 levels and enhancing its expression in keloid fibroblasts represses COL1A1. We propose that tonic signalling by BDKRB2 prevents collagen overproduction in skin fibroblasts.
AIM: Genetic polymorphisms may influence the incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough. This study aims to investigate this association. METHODS: Ten electronic databases and PharmGKB were systematically searched. Pooled odds ratio values and their 95% CI were used to assess the association, using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in the review, 17 of them were included from two separated meta-analysis (ACE I/D or BDKRB2-58T/C). Significant association was found between ACE I/D I carriers (ACE gene insertion) and ACE inhibitor-induced cough, showing racial and age differences. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that ACE I/D but not BDKRB2-58T/C polymorphism could be a predictor for the risk of ACE inhibitor-induced cough, especially in east Asians and the aged.
INTRODUCTION: Bradykinin, a vasodilator by nature has been documented to have a protective role against hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Polymorphisms of bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2) gene are reported to be predisposing factors for hypertension. Evaluation of the association between -58C>T and +/-9 bp polymorphisms of BDKRB2 with essential hypertension (EHT) was attempted. METHODS: Two hundred and fourteen primary hypertensives and 249 controls were genotyped for the selected markers by polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis (+/-9 bp), and SSCP (-58C>T). RESULTS: While -58C>T polymorphism did not reveal any association with EHT, +/-9 bp polymorphism showed a significant association with high risk for heterozygotes (+9/-9) when tested against the pooled frequencies of homozygotes (OR [odds ratio] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-2.38, P = .02), and this risk was 1.7 folds high in males (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.05-2.86, P = .06) and 1.9 folds high in familial cases (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.09-3.53, P = .04). In contrast, significant protective effect was observed for -9/-9 genotype against EHT when tested under dominant model in general (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.41-0.86, P = .01), in males (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.30-0.82, P = .01), and in familial cases (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.28-0.89, P = .04). Significant risk for +9 bp allele was observed in general (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.05-1.86, P = .04) and in males (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.13-2.41, P = .02). The interaction information analysis revealed a synergistic effect between the two polymorphisms contributing to EHT. +9/+9 genotype of +/-9 bp polymorphism when present in combination with CC genotype of -58C>T polymorphism showed 2.2-fold higher risk for developing EHT. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that allele +9 bp might be a risk factor for EHT in general and specially in males. Markers -58C>T and +/-9 bp may act synergistically causing susceptibility to EHT.
PURPOSE: The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is attributed partially to increased nitric oxide bioavailability. It is possible that functional polymorphisms in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and bradykinin receptor B2 (BDKRB2) genes may affect the antihypertensive response to enalapril. METHODS: We evaluated 106 hypertensive patients treated only with enalapril for 60 days. The difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) before and after the antihypertensive treatment was defined as DeltaMAP. If DeltaMAP were below or above the median value, the patients were classified as poor responders (PR) or good responders (GR), respectively. eNOS genotypes for the T(-786)C, G894T and 4b/4a polymorphisms were determined and haplotype frequencies were estimated by PHASE and Haplo.stats programs. The C(-58)T and BE1 +9/-9 polymorphisms of BDKRB2 genes and their haplotypes were determined by DNA sequencing. Robust multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to characterize gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: The TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the eNOS T(-786)C polymorphism were more frequent in GR than in PR. Furthermore, the TT genotype for the BDKRB2 C(-58)T polymorphism was more frequent in PR than GR. No other significant differences in genotypes or haplotypes were found. However, we found significant gene-gene interactions: the CC genotype for the BDKRB2 C(-58)T polymorphism was associated with response to enalapril depending on eNOS T(-786)C genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that eNOS T(-786)C and BDKRB2 C(-58)T polymorphisms may synergically affect the antihypertensive response to enalapril.
AIM: To develop and apply a novel genotyping method for the 9-bp exon 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism in BDKRB2. MATERIALS & METHODS: DNA from 718 patients with heart failure was extracted using standard methods and a region containing exon 1 of BDKRB2 was amplified with PCR. The PCR product was separated using the Qiagen QIAxcel(R) capillary electrophoresis system. The bp size of the PCR product was calculated and the genotypes determined using Qiagen BioCalculator(R) software. RESULTS: Capillary electrophoresis accurately genotyped samples with >99% call rate and 700 s run time per row of a 96-well plate (i.e., less than 1 min per sample). The frequency of the deletion was 49% in the Caucasian patients (n = 441) and 45% in the African-American (n = 277). CONCLUSION: Capillary electrophoresis is a rapid, accurate and sensitive method for genotyping the 9-bp exon 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism in BDKRB2.
Bradykinin, a member of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), is a potent, short-lived vasoactive peptide that acts as a vasodilator and an inflammatory mediator in a number of signaling mechanisms. Bradykinin induced signaling is mediated through kinin B1 (BDKRB1) and B2 (BDKRB2) transmembrane receptors coupled with different subunits of G proteins (G(alphai)/G(alpha0), G(alphaq) and G(beta1gamma2)). The bradykinin-mediated signaling mechanism activates excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-8 and IL-2. Upregulation of these cytokines has implications in a wide range of clinical conditions such as inflammation leading to fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In SARS-CoV-2 infection, bradykinin is found to be at raised levels and is reported to trigger a diverse array of symptoms. All of this brings bradykinin to the core point as a molecule of immense therapeutic value. Our understanding of its involvement in various pathways has expanded with time. Therefore, there is a need to look at the overall picture that emerges from the developments made by deciphering the bradykinin mediated signaling mechanisms involved in the pathological conditions. It will help devise strategies for developing better treatment modalities in the implicated diseases. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on bradykinin mediated signaling in the diverse conditions described above, with a marked emphasis on the therapeutic potential of targeting the bradykinin receptor.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs, which regulate gene expression in the posttranscriptional level. They are involved in cancer occurrence and development. Different members of the same miRNA family may have different roles. Since the fact that metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related death and miR-129 has three members, in this study, we focused on the migration inhibitory role of miR-129-1-3p in gastric cancer and explored the possible mechanisms. We first compared the expression of three miR-129 family members, miR-129-5p, miR-129-1-3p, and miR-129-2-3p, between gastric carcinoma tissues and surgical margin non-cancer samples by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Then, we selected miR-129-1-3p for further analysis and transfected its mimic and inhibitor into gastric cancer BGC-823 cells, respectively. Then, we compared the BGC-823 cells' migration capacity by transwell assay. Finally, we predicted the possible targets of miR-129-1-3p and selected one target for further analysis by QRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that the expression of miR-129-1-3p in gastric carcinoma was significantly lower than that in surgical margin samples. And miR-129-1-3p could inhibit the migration of BGC-823 cells. From the candidates, we selected bradykinin receptor B2 (BDKRB2), which was reported relating to metastasis, as a target for further analysis. QRT-PCR showed that the expression of BDKRB2 was negatively related to miR-129-1-3p. Luciferase reporter assay showed that BDKRB2 was the target of the miR-129-1-3p. In summary, miR-129-1-3p inhibits the BGC-823 cell migration by targeting BDKRB2.
PURPOSE: Genetic factors are important in terms of athletic performance. Recent studies to determine the relationship between the genes that lead to physiological responses have attracted attention. In this respect, this meta-analysis study was designed to examine the relationship between genetic polymorphism (BDKRB2 rs5810761, GNB3 rs5443, HIF1A rs11549565, MCT1 rs1049434, NOS3 rs2070744) and endurance athlete's status. METHODS: The search included studies published from 2009 to 2022. To determine the relevant studies, Pubmed, Web of Science databases were systematically scanned. Only case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. To determine the relevant studies, Pubmed, Web of Science databases were systematically scanned, and a total of 31 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Relevant data from the included studies were collected and analyzed using a random effects or fixed effects model. The effect size was calculated as the odds ratio or a risk ratio the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: According to the results of the analysis, BDKRB2 rs5810761 + 9 allele, and NOS3 rs2070744 T allele were significantly more prevalent in endurance athletes (p < 0.05). Genotype distributions of BDKRB2 rs5810761, MCT1 rs1049434, and NOS3 rs2070744 showed significant differences in the dominant model (p < 0.05). However, no significant association was found between endurance athlete status and GNB3 rs5443 and HIF1A rs11549465 polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: These results show that some gene polymorphisms play an important role in endurance athlete status and suggest that having a specific genetic basis may also confer a physiological advantage for performance.
