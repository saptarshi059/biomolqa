Probable G-protein coupled receptor 150; Orphan receptor; Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
Current methods of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) phylogenetic classification are sequence based and therefore inappropriate for highly divergent sequences, sharing low sequence identity. In this study, sequence structure profile based alignment generated by PROMALS3D was used to understand the GPCR Class A Rhodopsin superfamily evolution using the MEGA 5 software. Phylogenetic analysis included a combination of Neighbor-Joining method and Maximum Likelihood method, with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Our study was able to identify potential ligand association for Class A Orphans and putative/unclassified Class A receptors with no cognate ligand information: GPR21 and GPR52 with fatty acids; GPR75 with Neuropeptide Y; GPR82, GPR18, GPR141 with N-arachidonylglycine; GPR176 with Free fatty acids, GPR10 with Tachykinin & Neuropeptide Y; GPR85 with ATP, ADP & UDP glucose; GPR151 with Galanin; GPR153 and GPR162 with Adrenalin, Noradrenalin; GPR146, GPR139, GPR142 with Neuromedin, Ghrelin, Neuromedin U-25 & Thyrotropin-releasing hormone; GPR171 with ATP, ADP & UDP Glucose; GPR88, GPR135, GPR161, GPR101with 11-cis-retinal; GPR83 with Tackykinin; GPR148 with Prostanoids, GPR109b, GPR81, GPR31with ATP & UTP and GPR150 with GnRH I & GnRHII. Furthermore, we suggest that this study would prove useful in re-classification of receptors, selecting templates for homology modeling and identifying ligands which may show cross reactivity with other GPCRs as signaling via multiple ligands play a significant role in disease modulation.
Recent studies have shown that several members of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) superfamily play crucial roles in the maintenance of ion-water homeostasis of the sperm and Sertoli cells, development of the germ cells, formation of the blood barrier, and maturation of sperm. The GPCR, guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor, membrane traffic protein, and small GTPase genes were analyzed by microarray and bioinformatics (3513 sperm and Sertoli cell genes). In the microarray analyses of three human cases with different nonobstructive azoospermia sperm, the expression of GOLGA8IP, OR2AT4, PHKA1, A2M, OR56A1, SEMA3G, LRRC17, APP, ARHGAP33, RABGEF1, NPY2R, GHRHR, LTB4R2, GRIK5, OR6K6, NAPG, OR6C65, VPS35, FPR3, and ARL4A was upregulated, while expression of MARS, SIRPG, OGFR, GPR150, LRRK1, and NGEF was downregulated. There was an increase in GBP3, GBP3, TNF, TGFB3, and CLTC expression in the Sertoli cells of three human cases with NOA, whereas expression of PAQR4, RRAGD, RAC2, SERPINB8, IRPB1, MRGPRF, RASA2, SIRPG, RGS2, RAP2A, RAB2B, ARL17, SERINC4, XIAP, DENND4C, ANKRA2, CSTA, STX18, and SNAP23 were downregulated. A combined analysis of Enrich Shiny Gene Ontology (GO), STRING, and Cytoscape was used to predict proteins' molecular interactions and then to recognize master pathways. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the biological process (BP), regulation of protein metabolic process, regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal transduction were significantly expressed in up-/downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in sperm. In molecular function (MF) experiments of DEGs that were up-/downregulated, it was found that GPCR activity, guanyl ribonucleotide binding, GTPase activity and nucleoside-triphosphatase activity were overexpressed. An analysis of GO enrichment findings of Sertoli cells showed BP and MF to be common DEGs. When these gene mutations have been validated, they can be used to create new GPCR antagonists or agonists that are receptor-selective.
Methylated promoter CpG islands (CGIs) can be used to find novel tumor-suppressor genes and disease markers. In this study, to identify promoter CGIs aberrantly methylated in human ovarian cancers, we performed a genome-wide screening for differentially methylated DNA fragments using methylation-sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA). MS-RDA isolated 185 DNA fragments specifically methylated in an ovarian cancer cell line (ES-2), compared with a normal human ovarian surface epithelial cell line (HOSE6-3), and 33 of them were derived from putative promoter CGIs. Ten ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR, and seven (GPR150, LOC222171, PRTFDC1, LOC339210, ITGA8, C9orf64 and HOXD11) of the 33 CGIs were methylated in one or more of the cell lines. Their downstream genes were barely expressed in cell lines without unmethylated DNA molecules by quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR. Demethylation of methylated cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored expression of two genes (PRTFDC1 and C9orf64). In primary ovarian cancers, CGIs of GPR150 (in 4 of 15 cancers), ITGA8 (2/15), PRTFDC1 (1/15), and HOXD11 (1/15) were methylated. Silencing of PRTFDC1 was revealed here for the first time, and aberrant methylation of GPR150, ITGA8 and HOXD11 could be candidate tumor markers.
We report nine new members of the Rhodopsin family of human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) found by searches in the genome databases. BLAST searches and phylogenetic analyses showed that only four of the receptors are closely related to previously characterised GPCRs, GPR150 and GPR154 to oxytocin/vasopressin receptors, GPR152 to CRTH2/FPRs and GPR165 to GPR72/NPYR. Four of the receptors, GPR139, GPR146, GPR153 and GPR162, have one other orphan GPCRs as close relative while GPR148 lacks close relatives. We have identified in total 37 orthologues for the new receptors, primarily from rat, mouse, chicken, fugu and zebrafish. GPR162 and GPR139 are remarkably well conserved while GPR148 seems to be evolving rapidly. Analyses using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) indicate that all the new receptors except GPR153 have the CNS as a major site of expression.
Head and neck cancer (HNC) remains one of the most malignant tumors with a significantly high mortality. DNA methylation exerts a vital role in the prognosis of HNC. In this study, we try to screen abnormal differential methylation genes (DMGs) and pathways in Head-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma via integral bioinformatics analysis. Data of gene expression microarrays and gene methylation microarrays were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Aberrant DMGs were identified by the R Limma package. We conducted the Cox regression analysis to select the prognostic aberrant DMGs and site-speci fi c methylation. Five aberrant DMGs were recognized that significantly correlated with overall survival. The prognostic model was constructed based on five DMGs (PAX9, STK33, GPR150, INSM1, and EPHX3). The five DMG models acted as prognostic biomarkers for HNC. The area under the curve based on the five DMGs predicting 5-year survival is 0.665. Moreover, the correlation between the DMGs/site-speci fi c methylation and gene expression was also explored. The findings demonstrated that the five DMGs can be used as independent prognostic biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of patients with HNC. Our study might lay the groundwork for further mechanism exploration in HNC and may help identify diagnostic biomarkers for early stage HNC.
