Cytokine receptor common subunit gamma; Common subunit for the receptors for a variety of interleukins. Probably in association with IL15RA, involved in the stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis by IL15. Belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Type 5 subfamily.
OVERVIEW: IL-7 is a member of the family of cytokines with four anti-parallel alpha helixes that bind Type I cytokine receptors. It is produced by stromal cells and is required for development and homeostatic survival of lymphoid cells. GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE: Interleukin 7 (IL7) human IL7: gene ID: 3574 on ch 8; murine Il7 gene ID: 16,196 on ch 3. PROTEIN: Precursor contains a signal sequence, mature human IL-7 peptide 152aa, predicted 17.4kd peptide, glycosylated resulting in 25kd. Crystal structure: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/3DI2. REGULATION OF IL-7 PRODUCTION: Major producers are stromal cells in thymus, bone marrow and lymphoid organs but also reported in other tissues. Production is primarily constitutive but reported to be affected by IFNgamma and other factors. IL-7 RECEPTORS: Two chains IL-7Ralpha (IL-7R) and gammac (IL-2RG). Human IL-7R: gene ID 3575 on ch 5; human IL2RG: gene ID 3561 on ch X; mouse IL-7R: gene ID 16,197 on ch 15; murine Il2rg gene ID 16,186 on ch X. Member of gammac family of receptors for cytokines IL-2, -4, -9, -15, and -21. Primarily expressed on lymphocytes but reports of other cell types. Expression in T-cells downregulated by IL-7. Low expression on Tregs, no expression on mature B-cells. Crystal structure: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/3DI2. IL-7 RECEPTOR SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS: Major signals through JAK1, JAK3 to STAT5 and through non-canonical STAT3, STAT1, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF IL-7: Required for survival of immature thymocytes, naive T-cells, memory T-cells, pro-B-cells and innate lymphocytes. Pharmacological treatment with IL-7 induces expansion of naive and memory T-cells and pro-B-cells. ABNORMALITIES OF THE IL-7 PATHWAY IN DISEASE: Deficiencies in the IL-7 pathway in humans and mice result in severe combined immunodeficiency due to lymphopenia. Excessive signaling of the pathway in mice drives autoimmune diseases and in humans is associated with autoimmune syndromes including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, atopic dermatitis and asthma. Mutations in the IL-7 receptor pathway drive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS: IL-7 has been evaluated in patients with cancer and shown to expand lymphocytes. It accelerated lymphocyte recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transfer, and increased lymphocyte counts in AIDS patients and sepsis patients. Monoclonal antibodies blocking the IL-7 receptor are being evaluated in autoimmune diseases. Cytotoxic monoclonals are being evaluated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs blocking the signal transduction pathway are being tested in autoimmunity and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
We have developed a cancer model of gliomas in human cerebral organoids that allows direct observation of tumor initiation as well as continuous microscopic observations. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target an HRas(G12V)-IRES-tdTomato construct by homologous recombination into the TP53 locus. Results show that transformed cells rapidly become invasive and destroy surrounding organoid structures, overwhelming the entire organoid. Tumor cells in the organoids can be orthotopically xenografted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID IL2RG(-/-) animals, exhibiting an invasive phenotype. Organoid-generated putative tumor cells show gene expression profiles consistent with mesenchymal subtype human glioblastoma. We further demonstrate that human-organoid-derived tumor cell lines or primary human-patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines can be transplanted into human cerebral organoids to establish invasive tumor-like structures. Our results show potential for the use of organoids as a platform to test human cancer phenotypes that recapitulate key aspects of malignancy.
Xenograft cell transplantation into immunodeficient mice has become the gold standard for assessing pre-clinical efficacy of cancer drugs, yet direct visualization of single-cell phenotypes is difficult. Here, we report an optically-clear prkdc(-/-), il2rga(-/-) zebrafish that lacks adaptive and natural killer immune cells, can engraft a wide array of human cancers at 37 degrees C, and permits the dynamic visualization of single engrafted cells. For example, photoconversion cell-lineage tracing identified migratory and proliferative cell states in human rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric cancer of muscle. Additional experiments identified the preclinical efficacy of combination olaparib PARP inhibitor and temozolomide DNA-damaging agent as an effective therapy for rhabdomyosarcoma and visualized therapeutic responses using a four-color FUCCI cell-cycle fluorescent reporter. These experiments identified that combination treatment arrested rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the G2 cell cycle prior to induction of apoptosis. Finally, patient-derived xenografts could be engrafted into our model, opening new avenues for developing personalized therapeutic approaches in the future.
N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), as the most pervasive internal modification of eukaryotic mRNA, plays a crucial role in various cancers, but its role in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis has not yet been investigated. In this study, we revealed significantly decreased m(6)A methylation in plasma cells (PCs) from MM patients and showed that the abnormal m(6)A level resulted mainly from upregulation of the demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that FTO plays a tumor-promoting and pro-metastatic role in MM. Combined m(6)A and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and subsequent validation and functional studies identified heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) as a functional target of FTO-mediated m(6)A modification. FTO significantly promotes MM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting HSF1/HSPs in a YTHDF2-dependent manner. FTO inhibition, especially when combined with bortezomib (BTZ) treatment, synergistically inhibited myeloma bone tumor formation and extramedullary spread in NOD-Prkdc(em26Cd52)il2rg(em26Cd22)/Nju (NCG) mice. We demonstrated the functional importance of m(6)A demethylase FTO in MM progression, especially in promoting extramedullary myeloma (EMM) formation, and proposed the FTO-HSF1/HSP axis as a potential novel therapeutic target in MM.
Solid cancer cells commonly enter the blood and disseminate systemically, but are highly inefficient at forming distant metastases for poorly understood reasons. Here we studied human melanomas that differed in their metastasis histories in patients and in their capacity to metastasize in NOD-SCID-Il2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice. We show that melanomas had high frequencies of cells that formed subcutaneous tumours, but much lower percentages of cells that formed tumours after intravenous or intrasplenic transplantation, particularly among inefficiently metastasizing melanomas. Melanoma cells in the blood and visceral organs experienced oxidative stress not observed in established subcutaneous tumours. Successfully metastasizing melanomas underwent reversible metabolic changes during metastasis that increased their capacity to withstand oxidative stress, including increased dependence on NADPH-generating enzymes in the folate pathway. Antioxidants promoted distant metastasis in NSG mice. Folate pathway inhibition using low-dose methotrexate, ALDH1L2 knockdown, or MTHFD1 knockdown inhibited distant metastasis without significantly affecting the growth of subcutaneous tumours in the same mice. Oxidative stress thus limits distant metastasis by melanoma cells in vivo.
In this study, we demonstrate a newly derived mouse model that supports engraftment of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the absence of irradiation. We cross the NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) strain with the C57BL/6J-Kit(W-41J)/J (C57BL/6.Kit(W41)) strain and engraft, without irradiation, the resulting NBSGW strain with human cord blood CD34+ cells. At 12-weeks postengraftment in NBSGW mice, we observe human cell chimerism in marrow (97% +/- 0.4%), peripheral blood (61% +/- 2%), and spleen (94% +/- 2%) at levels observed with irradiation in NSG mice. We also detected a significant number of glycophorin-A-positive expressing cells in the developing NBSGW marrow. Further, the observed levels of human hematopoietic chimerism mimic those reported for both irradiated NSG and NSG-transgenic strains. This mouse model permits HSC engraftment while avoiding the complicating hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and neurological side effects associated with irradiation and allows investigators without access to radiation to pursue engraftment studies with human HSCs.
BACKGROUND: The dynamics of mitochondrial respiratory cristae (MRC) and its impact on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) play a crucial role in driving the progression of high-grade glioma (HGG). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we employed machine learning-based transmission electron microscopy analysis of 7141 mitochondria from 54 resected glioma patients. Additionally, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and multiplex immunohistochemical (mIHC) staining of clinical glioma microarrays to identify key molecules involved in glioma. Subsequently, we modulated the expression levels of mitochondrial dynamic-1-like protein (DNM1L/DRP1), and its two receptors, mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), via lentiviral transfection to further investigate the central role of these molecules in the dynamics of glioblastoma (GBM) cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs). We then evaluated the potential impact of DNM1L/DRP1, FIS1, and MFF on the proliferation and progression of GBM cells and GSCs using a combination of CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, Wound Healing assay, tumor spheroid formation assay and cell derived xenograft assay employing NOD/ShiLtJGpt-Prkdc(em26Cd52)Il2rg(em26Cd22)/Gpt (NCG) mouse model. Subsequently, we validated the ability of the DNM1L/DRP1-FIS1 axis to remodel MRC structure through mitophagy by utilizing Seahorse XF analysis technology, mitochondrial function detection, MRC abundance detection and monitoring dynamic changes in mitophagy. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that compared to low-grade glioma (LGG), HGG exhibited more integrated MRC structures. Further research revealed that DNM1L/DRP1, FIS1, and MFF played pivotal roles in governing mitochondrial fission and remodeling MRC in HGG. The subsequent validation demonstrated that DNM1L/DRP1 exerts a positive regulatory effect on FIS1, whereas the interaction between MFF and FIS1 demonstrates a competitive inhibition relationship. The down-regulation of the DNM1L/DRP1-FIS1 axis significantly impaired mitophagy, thereby hindering the remodeling of MRC and inhibiting OXPHOS function in glioma, ultimately leading to the inhibition of its aggressive progression. In contrast, MFF exerts a contrasting effect on MRC integrity, OXPHOS activity, and glioma progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that the DNM1L/DRP1-FIS1 axis stabilizes MRC structures through mitophagy in HGG cells while driving their OXPHOS activity ultimately leading to robust disease progression. The inhibition of the DNM1L/DRP1-FIS1 axis hinders MRC remodeling and suppresses GBM progression. We propose that down-regulation of the DNM1L/DRP1-FIS1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HGG.
The golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has long been a valuable rodent model of human diseases, especially infectious and metabolic diseases. Hamsters have also been valuable models of several chemically induced cancers such as the DMBA-induced oral cheek pouch cancer model. Recently, with the application of CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering technology, hamsters can now be gene targeted as readily as mouse models. This review describes the phenotypes of three gene-targeted knockout (KO) hamster cancer models, TP53, KCNQ1, and IL2RG. Notably, these hamster models demonstrate cancer phenotypes not observed in mouse KOs. In some cases, the cancers that arise in the KO hamster are similar to cancers that arise in humans, in contrast with KO mice that do not develop the cancers. An example is the development of aggressive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in TP53 KO hamsters. The review also presents a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of mouse cancer models and hamster cancer models and argues that there are no perfect rodent models of cancer and that the genetically engineered hamster cancer models can complement mouse models and expand the suite of animal cancer models available for the development of new cancer therapies.
INTRODUCTION: Current anti-rheumatic drugs are primarily modulating immune cell activation, yet their effectiveness remained suboptimal. Therefore, novel therapeutics targeting alternative mechanisms, such as synovial activation, is urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of Midline-1 (Mid1) in synovial activation. METHODS: NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mice were used to establish a subcutaneous xenograft model. Wild-type C57BL/6, Mid1(-/-), Dpp4(-/-), and Mid1(-/-)Dpp4(-/-) mice were used to establish a collagen-induced arthritis model. Cell viability, cell cycle, qPCR and western blotting analysis were used to detect MH7A proliferation, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and Mid1 levels. Co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis identified the candidate protein of Mid1 substrates. Ubiquitination assays were used to determine DPP4 ubiquitination status. RESULTS: An increase in Mid1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was observed in human RA synovial tissue by GEO dataset analysis, and this elevation was confirmed in a collagen-induced mouse arthritis model. Notably, deletion of Mid1 in a collagen-induced arthritis model completely protected mice from developing arthritis. Subsequent overexpression and knockdown experiments on MH7A, a human synoviocyte cell line, unveiled a previously unrecognized role of Mid1 in synoviocyte proliferation and migration, the key aspects of synovial activation. Co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis identified DPP4 as the most significant candidate of Mid1 substrates. Mechanistically, Mid1 promoted synoviocyte proliferation and migration by inducing ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of DPP4. DPP4 deficiency led to increased proliferation, migration, and inflammatory cytokine production in MH7A, while reconstitution of DPP4 significantly abolished Mid1-induced augmentation of cell proliferation and activation. Additionally, double knockout model showed that DPP4 deficiency abolished the protective effect of Mid1 defect on arthritis. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings suggest that the ubiquitination of DPP4 by Mid1 promotes synovial cell proliferation and invasion, exacerbating synovitis in RA. These results reveal a novel mechanism that controls synovial activation, positioning Mid1 as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in RA.
Ethical considerations constrain the in vivo study of human hemopoietic stem cells (HSC). To overcome this limitation, small animal models of human HSC engraftment have been used. We report the development and characterization of a new genetic stock of IL-2R common gamma-chain deficient NOD/LtSz-scid (NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null)) mice and document their ability to support human mobilized blood HSC engraftment and multilineage differentiation. NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) mice are deficient in mature lymphocytes and NK cells, survive beyond 16 mo of age, and even after sublethal irradiation resist lymphoma development. Engraftment of NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) mice with human HSC generate 6-fold higher percentages of human CD45(+) cells in host bone marrow than with similarly treated NOD-scid mice. These human cells include B cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and HSC. Spleens from engrafted NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) mice contain human Ig(+) B cells and lower numbers of human CD3(+) T cells. Coadministration of human Fc-IL7 fusion protein results in high percentages of human CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes as well human CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(+) peripheral blood and splenic T cells. De novo human T cell development in NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) mice was validated by 1) high levels of TCR excision circles, 2) complex TCRbeta repertoire diversity, and 3) proliferative responses to PHA and streptococcal superantigen, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin. Thus, NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) mice engrafted with human mobilized blood stem cells provide a new in vivo long-lived model of robust multilineage human HSC engraftment.
Translation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to human therapeutics holds high promise. However, specificity remains a concern especially when modifying stem cell populations. We show that existing rationally engineered Cas9 high-fidelity variants have reduced on-target activity when using the therapeutically relevant ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery method. Therefore, we devised an unbiased bacterial screen to isolate variants that retain activity in the RNP format. Introduction of a single point mutation, p.R691A, in Cas9 (high-fidelity (HiFi) Cas9) retained the high on-target activity of Cas9 while reducing off-target editing. HiFi Cas9 induces robust AAV6-mediated gene targeting at five therapeutically relevant loci (HBB, IL2RG, CCR5, HEXB, and TRAC) in human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as primary T cells. We also show that HiFi Cas9 mediates high-level correction of the sickle cell disease (SCD)-causing p.E6V mutation in HSPCs derived from patients with SCD. We anticipate that HiFi Cas9 will have wide utility for both basic science and therapeutic genome-editing applications.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that acts through a quaternary receptor signaling complex containing alpha (IL-2Ralpha), beta (IL-2Rbeta), and common gamma chain (gc) receptors. In the structure of the quaternary ectodomain complex as visualized at a resolution of 2.3 angstroms, the binding of IL-2Ralpha to IL-2 stabilizes a secondary binding site for presentation to IL-2Rbeta. gammac is then recruited to the composite surface formed by the IL-2/IL-2Rbeta complex. Consistent with its role as a shared receptor for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, gammac forms degenerate contacts with IL-2. The structure of gammac provides a rationale for loss-of-function mutations found in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (X-SCID). This complex structure provides a framework for other gammac-dependent cytokine-receptor interactions and for the engineering of improved IL-2 therapeutics.
While insensitivity to GH (GHI) is characterized by low IGF-I levels, normal or elevated GH levels, and lack of IGF-I response to GH treatment, IGF-I resistance is characterized by elevated IGF-I levels with normal/high GH levels. Several genetic defects are responsible for impairment of GH and IGF-I actions resulting in short stature that could affect intrauterine growth or be present in the postnatal period. The genetic defects affecting GH and/or IGF-I action can be divided into five different groups: GH insensitivity by defects affecting the GH receptor (GHR), the intracellular GH signaling pathway (STAT5B, STAT3, IKBKB, IL2RG, PIK3R1), the synthesis of insulin-like growth factors (IGF1, IGF2), the transport/bioavailability of IGFs (IGFALS, PAPPA2), and defects affecting IGF-I sensitivity (IGF1R). Complete GH insensitivity (GHI) was first reported by Zvi Laron and his colleagues in patients with classical appearance of GH deficiency, but presenting elevated levels of GH. The association of GH insensitivity with several clinical sings of immune-dysfunction and autoimmune dysregulation are characteristic of molecular defects in the intracellular GH signaling pathway (STAT5B, STAT3, IKBKB, IL2RG, PIK3R1). Gene mutations in the IGF1 and IGF2 genes have been described in patients presenting intrauterine growth retardation and postnatal short stature. Molecular defects have also been reported in the IGFALS gene, that encodes the acid-labile subunit (ALS), responsible to stabilize circulating IGF-I in ternary complexes, and more recently in the PAPPA2 gen that encodes the pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2, a protease that specifically cleaves IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 regulating the accessibility of IGFs to their target tissues. Mutations in the IGF1R gene resulted in IGF-I insensitivity in patients with impaired intrauterine and postnatal growth. These studies have revealed novel molecular mechanisms of GH insensitivity/primary IGF-I deficiency beyond the GH receptor gene. In addition, they have also underlined the importance of several players of the GH-IGF axis in the complex system that promotes human growth.
Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is crucial for the generation of multiple lymphocyte subsets (natural killer (NK), NK-T cells, and memory CD8 T cells), and transpresentation of IL-15 by monocytes and dendritic cells has been suggested to be the dominant activating process of these lymphocytes. We have previously shown that a natural soluble form of IL-15R alpha chain corresponding to the entire extracellular domain of IL-15R alpha behaves as a high affinity IL-15 antagonist. In sharp contrast with this finding, we demonstrate in this report that a recombinant, soluble sushi domain of IL-15R alpha, which bears most of the binding affinity for IL-15, behaves as a potent IL-15 agonist by enhancing its binding and biological effects (proliferation and protection from apoptosis) through the IL-15R beta/gamma heterodimer, whereas it does not affect IL-15 binding and function of the tripartite IL-15R alpha/beta/gamma membrane receptor. Our results suggest that, if naturally produced, such soluble sushi domains might be involved in the IL-15 transpresentation mechanism. Fusion proteins (RLI and ILR), in which IL-15 and IL-15R alpha-sushi are attached by a flexible linker, are even more potent than the combination of IL-15 plus sIL-15R alpha-sushi. After binding to IL-15R beta/gamma, RLI is internalized and induces a biological response very similar to the IL-15 high affinity response. Such hyper-IL-15 fusion proteins appear to constitute potent adjuvants for the expansion of lymphocyte subsets.
BACKGROUND: Although the extreme condition of typical profound T-cell dysfunction (TD), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), has been carefully defined, we are currently in the process of better defining less typical T-cell deficiencies, which tend to present with autologous circulating T-cell combined immunodeficiency (CID). Because autologous cells might interfere with the outcome of bone marrow transplantation, protocols usually include conditioning regimens. Therefore it is important to define the numbers of autologous cells usually detected in patients with CID versus those with SCID. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the number of circulating T cells in patients with SCID as opposed to those with CID, to study their function, and to evaluate their possible detection during newborn screening using T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis. METHODS: Numbers of circulating CD3(+) T cells (as determined by means of flow cytometry), in vitro responses to PHA, and TREC levels, all measured at presentation, were compiled from the research charts of the entire cohort of patients followed prospectively for T-cell immunodeficiency at the Hospital for Sick Children. Clinical data were ascertained retrospectively from the patient's hospital charts. RESULTS: One hundred three patients had CD3(+) determinations, and 80 of them had a genetic diagnosis. All patients considered to have typical SCID had CD3(+) T-cell counts of fewer than 500 cells/muL. Some variability was observed among different genotypes. In vitro responses to PHA were recorded in 88 patients, of whom 68 had a genetic diagnosis. All patients with low CD3(+) T-cell numbers (<500 cells/muL) also had markedly decreased responses to PHA (typical SCIDs). However, responses ranged widely in the groups of patients with TD who had more than 500 CD3(+) autologous circulating T cells per microliter. Although patients with Omenn syndrome and zeta chain-associated protein, 70 kDa (ZAP70), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiencies had low responses, patients with the p.R222C mutation in the IL-2 receptor gamma(IL2RG) gene as well as IL-10 receptor and CD40 ligand deficiencies had normal or near-normal mitogen responses. Finally, 51 patients had TREC levels measured. All patients with typical SCID, Omenn syndrome, and ZAP70 deficiency had low TREC levels. In contrast, patients with mutations in forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3), CD40 ligand (CD40L), and IL-10 receptor alpha(IL10RA), as well as patients with the p.R222C mutation in the IL2RG gene, had normal TREC levels. CONCLUSION: Patients with typical SCID can be defined as having fewer than 500 circulating CD3(+) T cells. Most patients with autologous T cells still have profound TD, as defined by reduced in vitro function and thymus output. Some patients with conditions including TD have normal TREC levels and will therefore not be detected in a TREC-based newborn screening program.
BACKGROUND: The systematic molecular associations between the peripheral blood cells and brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, which hinders our understanding of AD pathological mechanisms and the exploration of new diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: Here, we performed an integrated analysis of the brain and peripheral blood cells transcriptomics to establish peripheral biomarkers of AD. By employing multiple statistical analyses plus machine learning, we identified and validated multiple regulated central and peripheral network in patients with AD. RESULTS: By bioinformatics analysis, a total of 243 genes were differentially expressed in the central and peripheral systems, mainly enriched in three modules: immune response, glucose metabolism and lysosome. In addition, lysosome related gene ATP6V1E1 and immune response related genes (IL2RG, OSM, EVI2B TNFRSF1A, CXCR4, STAT5A) were significantly correlated with Abeta or Tau pathology. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that ATP6V1E1 showed high-diagnostic potential for AD. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data identified the main pathological pathways in AD progression, particularly the systemic dysregulation of the immune response, and provided peripheral biomarkers for AD diagnosis.
BACKGROUND: Although there have been indications that periodontitis (PD) may be susceptible to alopecia areata (AA), the underlying mechanism of its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The objective of our study is to conduct further research into the occurrence of this complication. METHODS: The gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was the source of acquisition for both PD and AA datasets. Various methods, including the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, Cytohubba algorithms, and RandomForest algorithms, were utilized to identify candidate hub immuno-related genes (IRGs) for diagnosing AA with PD. The diagnostic efficacy was assessed by constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. To further deepen our understanding, immune cell infiltration, flow cytometry assay, and immunofluorescence techniques were employed to uncover immune cell dysregulation in PD and AA. RESULTS: 899 and 803 DEGs were detected in AA and PD, respectively, with an intersection of 150 common DEGs enriched in immune regulation. Further analysis of the junction of shared DEGs and IRGs was analyzed using the PPI network, Mcode, and Cytohubba algorithms. Three hub genes (CTSS, IL2RG, and ITGAL) were subsequently selected by Cytohubba and RandomForest algorithms and were found to be promising candidate hub genes with high diagnostic values (AUC ranging from 0.776 to 0.909) for diagnosing AA with PD. Additionally, various dysregulated immune cells were observed, with mast cells potentially serving as markers for AA and plasma for PD. CONCLUSION: Three candidate hub IRGs (CTSS, IL2RG, and ITGAL) were identified with considerable diagnostic values. Besides, mast cells could serve as markers for AA, while plasma may indicate PD. Our research has the potential to identify shared diagnostic candidate genes and immune cells for AA and PD patients.
Despite advances in treatment strategies, colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality, with mounting evidence a close link between immune system dysfunctions issued. Interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL-2RG) plays a pivotal role as a common subunit receptor in the IL-2 family cytokines and activates the JAK-STAT pathway. This study delves into the role of Interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL-2RG) within the tumor microenvironment and investigates potential microRNAs (miRNAs) that directly inhibit IL-2RG, aiming to discern their impact on CRC clinical outcomes. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a significant upregulation of IL-2RG mRNA in TCGA-COAD samples and showed strong correlations with the infiltration of various lymphocytes. Single-cell analysis corroborated these findings, highlighting IL-2RG expression in critical immune cell subsets. To explore miRNA involvement in IL-2RG dysregulation, mRNA was isolated from the tumor tissues and lymphocytes of 258 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls, and IL-2RG was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector. Human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK-293T) were transfected with this construct. Our research involved a comprehensive analysis of miRPathDB, miRWalk, and Targetscan databases to identify the miRNAs associated with the 3' UTR of human IL-2RG. The human microRNA (miRNA) molecules, hsa-miR-7-5p and hsa-miR-26b-5p, have been identified as potent suppressors of IL-2RG expression in CRC patients. Specifically, the downregulation of hsa-miR-7-5p and hsa-miR-26b-5p has been shown to result in the upregulation of IL-2RG mRNA expression in these patients. Prognostic evaluation of IL-2RG, hsa-miR-7-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p, using TCGA-COAD data and patient samples, established that higher IL-2RG expression and lower expression of both miRNAs were associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, this study identified several long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), such as ZFAS1, SOX21-AS1, SNHG11, SNHG16, SNHG1, DLX6-AS1, GAS5, SNHG6, and MALAT1, which may act as competing endogenous RNA molecules for IL2RG by sequestering shared hsa-miR-7-5p and hsa-miR-26b-5p. In summary, this investigation underscores the potential utility of IL-2RG, hsa-miR-7-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p as serum and tissue biomarkers for predicting CRC patient prognosis while also offering promise as targets for immunotherapy in CRC management.
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) encompasses a range of inherited disorders that lead to a profound deterioration of the immune system. Among the pivotal genes associated with SCID, RAG1 and IL2RG play crucial roles. IL2RG is essential for the development, differentiation, and functioning of T, B, and NK cells, while RAG1 critically contributes to adaptive immunity by facilitating V(D)J recombination during the maturation of lymphocytes. Animal models carrying mutations in these genes exhibit notable deficiencies in their immune systems. Non-human primates (NHPs) are exceptionally well-suited models for biomedical research due to their genetic and physiological similarities to humans. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) serve as powerful tools for precisely and effectively modifying single-base mutations in the genome. Their successful implementation has been demonstrated in human cells, mice, and crop species. This study outlines the creation of an immunodeficient monkey model by deactivating both the IL2RG and RAG1 genes using the CBE4max system. The base-edited monkeys exhibited a severely compromised immune system characterized by lymphopenia, atrophy of lymphoid organs, and a deficiency of mature T cells. Furthermore, these base-edited monkeys were capable of hosting and supporting the growth of human breast cancer cells, leading to tumor formation. In summary, we have successfully developed an immunodeficient monkey model with the ability to foster tumor growth using the CBE4max system. These immunodeficiency monkeys show tremendous potential as valuable tools for advancing biomedical and translational research.
Interleukin-15 (IL-15) exerts powerful stimulatory effects on lymphocyte subsets that result in antiviral and antitumoral activities. The functions of this cytokine are mainly mediated in a cell-to-cell contact fashion termed IL-15 trans-presentation. This function is mediated by a cell which tethers IL-15 to its plasmatic membrane complexed to IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha). Such surface complexes interact with interleukin-2 receptor beta and gamma on the adjacent cell to elicit signaling. Unlike interleukin-2, IL-15 protects from activation-induced cell death and does not promote regulatory cells. These features underlie its activity against transplanted tumors and its adjuvanticity in tumor and viral vaccines. The GMP-manufactured recombinant protein is undergoing clinical trials but its rapid renal clearance calls for biotechnological strategies to increase molecular weight and ensure IL-15Ralpha. trans-presentation. Since early efforts with stable transfected tumor cells, IL-15 has been tested in a variety gene therapy approaches. Those mainly include transfer of expression cassettes to tumor cells, T cells, dendritic cells, vaccination sites and the liver as a biofactory organ. Detailed mechanistic knowledge of IL-15 biology is envisaged to make the most of a powerful immunotherapeutic tool ranked as one of the most promising for cancer immunotherapy.
