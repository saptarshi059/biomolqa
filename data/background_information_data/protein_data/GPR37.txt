The mechanisms of pain induction by inflammation have been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms of pain resolution are not fully understood. Here, we report that GPR37, expressed by macrophages (MPhis) but not microglia, contributes to the resolution of inflammatory pain. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) and prosaptide TX14 increase intracellular Ca2+ (iCa2+) levels in GPR37-transfected HEK293 cells. NPD1 and TX14 also bind to GPR37 and cause GPR37-dependent iCa2+ increases in peritoneal MPhis. Activation of GPR37 by NPD1 and TX14 triggers MPhi phagocytosis of zymosan particles via calcium signaling. Hind paw injection of pH-sensitive zymosan particles not only induces inflammatory pain and infiltration of neutrophils and MPhis, but also causes GPR37 upregulation in MPhis, phagocytosis of zymosan particles and neutrophils by MPhis in inflamed paws, and resolution of inflammatory pain in WT mice. Mice lacking Gpr37 display deficits in MPhi phagocytic activity and delayed resolution of inflammatory pain. Gpr37-deficient MPhis also show dysregulations of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. MPhi depletion delays the resolution of inflammatory pain. Adoptive transfer of WT but not Gpr37-deficient MPhis promotes the resolution of inflammatory pain. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of GPR37 in regulating MPhi phagocytosis and inflammatory pain resolution.
Liver metastases are commonly detected in a range of malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC), unfortunately no effectively strategies for CRC liver metastasis (CRLM). In this study, we found GPR37 expression dramatically increased in human CRLM specimens and associated poor prognosis. GPR37 depletion greatly suppressed the liver metastasis in the mouse models of CRLM. Functional experiments showed that GPR37 knockdown inhibited the growth by reducing the glycolysis of CRC cells. Also, GPR37 knockdown in tumor cells produced decreased levels of two chemokines involved in neutrophil accumulation, which abrogated neutrophil recruitment in the tumor microenvironment of CRLM. Finally, the mechanism studies revealed that GPR37 could activate the hippo pathway, thereby promoting LDHA expression and glycolysis. This leads to increased lactylation of H3K18la, resulting in up-regulation of CXCL1 and CXCL5. These results support a role of the GPR37 in modulating the tumor metabolism and microenvironment in CRLM and GPR37 could be a potential therapeutic target.
Ischemic events lead to many diseases and deaths worldwide. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) occurs due to reduced blood circulation in tissues followed by blood reflow. Reoxygenation of ischemic tissues is characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, energy distress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. There are still no adequate clinical protocols or pharmacological approaches to address the consequences of I/R damage. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets. They compose a large family of seven transmembrane-spanning proteins that are involved in many biological functions. Orphan GPCRs are a large subgroup of these receptors expressed in different organs. In the present review, we summarized the literature regarding the role of orphan GPCRs in I/R in different organs. We focused on the effect of these receptors on modulating cellular and molecular processes underlying ischemia including apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy. The study showed that GPR3, GPR4, GPR17, GPR30, GPR31, GPR35, GPR37, GPR39, GPR55, GPR65, GPR68, GPR75, GPR81, and GPR91 are involved in ischemic events, mainly in the brain and heart. These receptors offer new possibilities for treating I/R injuries in the body.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are successful druggable targets, making up around 35% of all FDA-approved medications. However, a large number of receptors remain orphaned, with no known endogenous ligand, representing a challenging but untapped area to discover new therapeutic targets. Among orphan GPCRs (oGPCRs) of interest, G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the spinal cord and oligodendrocytes. While its cellular signaling mechanisms and endogenous receptor ligands remain elusive, GPR37 has been implicated in several important neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), inflammation, pain, autism, and brain tumors. GPR37 structure, signaling, emerging physiology, and pharmacology are reviewed while integrating a discussion on potential therapeutic indications and opportunities.
Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare type of vacuolating leukodystrophy (white matter disorder), which is mainly caused by defects in MLC1 or glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM) proteins. In addition, autoantibodies to GlialCAM are involved in the pathology of multiple sclerosis. MLC1 and GLIALCAM genes encode for membrane proteins of unknown function, which has been linked to the regulation of different ion channels and transporters, such as the chloride channel VRAC (volume regulated anion channel), ClC-2 (chloride channel 2), and connexin 43 or the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump. However, the mechanisms by which MLC proteins regulate these ion channels and transporters, as well as the exact function of MLC proteins remain obscure. It has been suggested that MLC proteins might regulate signalling pathways, but the mechanisms involved are, at present, unknown. With the aim of answering these questions, we have recently described the brain GlialCAM interactome. Within the identified proteins, we could validate the interaction with several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the orphan GPRC5B and the proposed prosaposin receptors GPR37L1 and GPR37. In this review, we summarize new aspects of the pathophysiology of MLC disease and key aspects of the interaction between GPR37 receptors and MLC proteins.
The vertebrate G protein-coupled receptor 37 and G protein-coupled receptor 37-like 1 (GPR37 and GPR37L1) proteins have amino acid sequence homology to endothelin and bombesin-specific receptors. The prosaposin glycoprotein, its derived peptides, and analogues have been reported to interact with and activate both putative receptors. The GPR37 and GPR37L1 genes are highly expressed in human and rodent brains. GPR37 transcripts are most abundant in oligodendrocytes and in the neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus, while the GPR37L1 gene is markedly expressed in cerebellar Bergmann glia astrocytes. The human GPR37 protein is a substrate of parkin, and its insoluble form accumulates in brain samples from patients of inherited juvenile Parkinson's disease. Several Gpr37 and Gpr37l1 mouse mutant strains have been produced and applied to extensive in vivo and ex vivo analyses of respective receptor functions and involvement in brain and other organ pathologies. The genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the different mouse strains so far published are reported and discussed, and their current and proposed applications to human disease modeling are highlighted.
Recent studies have shed light on the diverse and complex roles of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the pathophysiology of stroke. These receptors constitute a large family of seven transmembrane-spanning proteins that play an intricate role in cellular communication mechanisms which drive both tissue injury and repair following ischemic stroke. Orphan GPCRs represent a unique sub-class of GPCRs for which no natural ligands have been found. Interestingly, the majority of these receptors are expressed within the central nervous system where they represent a largely untapped resource for the treatment of neurological diseases. The focus of this review will thus be on the emerging roles of two brain-expressed orphan GPCRs, GPR37 and GPR37 L1, in regulating various cellular and molecular processes underlying ischemic stroke.
Since conformational flexibility, which is required for the function of a protein, comes at the expense of structural stability, many proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are under constant risk of misfolding and aggregation. In this regard GPR37 (also named PAEL-R and ETBR-LP-1) takes a prominent role, particularly in relation to Parkinson disease (PD). GPR37 is a substrate for parkin and accumulates abnormally in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, contributing to endoplasmic reticulum stress and death of dopaminergic neurons. GPR37 also constitutes a core structure of Lewy bodies, demonstrating a more general involvement in PD pathology. However, if folded and matured properly, GPR37 seems to be neuroprotective. Moreover, GPR37 modulates functionality of the dopamine transporter and the dopamine D2 receptor and stimulates dopamine neurotransmission. Here we review the multiple roles of GPR37 with relevance to potential disease modification and symptomatic therapies of PD and highlight unsolved issues in this field.
Prosaposin (also known as SGP-1) is an intriguing multifunctional protein that plays roles both intracellularly, as a regulator of lysosomal enzyme function, and extracellularly, as a secreted factor with neuroprotective and glioprotective effects. Following secretion, prosaposin can undergo endocytosis via an interaction with the low-density lipoprotein-related receptor 1 (LRP1). The ability of secreted prosaposin to promote protective effects in the nervous system is known to involve activation of G proteins, and the orphan G protein-coupled receptors GPR37 and GPR37L1 have recently been shown to mediate signaling induced by both prosaposin and a fragment of prosaposin known as prosaptide. In this review, we describe recent advances in our understanding of prosaposin, its receptors and their importance in the nervous system.
BACKGROUND: Gliomas are the most frequently diagnosed primary brain tumors, and are associated with multiple molecular aberrations during their development and progression. GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is implicated in different physiological pathways in the brain, and has been linked to various malignancies. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between GPR37 gene expression and the clinicopathological factors, patient prognosis, tumor-infiltrating immune cell signature GSEA and methylation levels in glioma. METHODS: We explored the diagnostic value, clinical relevance, and molecular function of GPR37 in glioma using TCGA, STRING, cBioPortal, Tumor Immunity Estimation Resource (TIMER) database and MethSurv databases. Besides, the "ssGSEA" algorithm was conducted to estimate immune cells infiltration abundance, with 'ggplot2' package visualizing the results. Immunohistochemical staining of clinical samples were used to verify the speculations of bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: GPR37 expression was significantly higher in the glioma tissues compared to the normal brain tissues, and was linked to poor prognosis. Functional annotation of GPR37 showed enrichment of ether lipid metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, and histidine metabolism. In addition, GSEA showed that GPR37 was positively correlated to the positive regulation of macrophage derived foam cell differentiation, negative regulation of T cell receptor signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, and negatively associated with immunoglobulin complex, immunoglobulin complex circulating, ribosome and spliceosome mediated by circulating immunoglobulin etc. TIMER2.0 and ssGSEA showed that GPR37 expression was significantly associated with the infiltration of T cells, CD8 T cell, eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils, NK CD56(dim) cells, NK cells, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), T helper cells and T effector memory (Tem) cells. In addition, high GPR37 expression was positively correlated with increased infiltration of M2 macrophages, which in turn was associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, GPR37 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints (ICPs). Finally, hypomethylation of the GPR37 promoter was associated with its high expression levels and poor prognosis in glioma. CONCLUSION: GPR37 had diagnostic and prognostic value in glioma. The possible biological mechanisms of GPR37 provide novel insights into the clinical diagnosis and treatment of glioma.
G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the main mediators of signal transduction in the central nervous system. Therefore, it is not surprising that many GPCRs have long been investigated for their role in the development of anxiety and mood disorders, as well as in the mechanism of action of antidepressant therapies. Importantly, the endogenous ligands for a large group of GPCRs have not yet been identified and are therefore known as orphan GPCRs (oGPCRs). Nonetheless, growing evidence from animal studies, together with genome wide association studies (GWAS) and post-mortem transcriptomic analysis in patients, pointed at many oGPCRs as potential pharmacological targets. Among these discoveries, we summarize in this review how emotional behaviors are modulated by the following oGPCRs: ADGRB2 (BAI2), ADGRG1 (GPR56), GPR3, GPR26, GPR37, GPR50, GPR52, GPR61, GPR62, GPR88, GPR135, GPR158, and GPRC5B.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignant tumor worldwide, leading to significant morbidity and disease burden. Diagnostic indicators and treatment objectives for CRC are urgently needed. This study demonstrates that GPR37, a GPCR receptor, is highly expressed in CRC. Depletion of GPR37 significantly reduced CRC tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Further tests showed that GPR37 protects cancer cells from ferroptosis by upregulating SCD1 expression, thereby modulating lipid metabolism, suppressing the level of reactive oxygen species, and mitigating ferroptosis. Mechanistic studies have shown that GPR37 modulates lipid metabolism in tumor cells by promoting SCD1 transcription via the MAPK-p38 signaling pathway. Our results reveal the pro-carcinogenic effect of GPR37 in primary CRC and suggest that targeting GPR37 could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic condition that causes myelin destruction and neuronal death, making it challenging to reverse. In spinal cord tissue, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes are essential for maintaining myelin morphology and axon regeneration. The decrease in oligodendrocyte lineage cells after SCI is a major factor contributing to the difficulty in restoring spinal cord function. However, there is still a lack of research on the status and intercellular communication between oligodendrocyte lineage cells after injury. The development of single-cell sequencing technology has enabled researchers to obtain highly accurate cellular transcriptional information, facilitating detailed studies of cellular subpopulations. This study delved into the cellular heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte lineage cells using a single-cell transcriptomic approach to uncover functional changes and cellular interactions during different time points after SCI. Our findings highlighted the critical roles of Psap (Prosaposin)/Gpr37l1 and Psap/Gpr37 ligand-receptor pairs among oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Furthermore, we predicted the transcription factors that may play a key regulatory role. We demonstrated for the first time that Junb acts almost exclusively in mature oligodendrocytes, which provides a potential target for the study of oligodendrocyte transcriptional mechanisms.
OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is a major public health concern and represents the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Among eukaryotes, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family stands as the largest group of membrane proteins. Alterations in GPCR gene expression and dysregulation of signal transduction have been recognized as the markers of malignancy. As a member of the GPCR family, G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) exhibits unknown functions in tumors, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) METHODS: We explored the expression and prognosis of GPR37 in NSCLC through TCGA, GTEx, GEO, and GEPIA2. We detected the expression of GPR37 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The study explored the influence of GPR37 on tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we examined the effects of GPR37 on tumor cell apoptosis and invasion. Most importantly, we investigated whether GPR37 affects cisplatin-induced drug resistance in NSCLC. Furthermore, by conducting animal experiments, we assessed the impact of GPR37 on NSCLC and delved into underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: (1) In NSCLC, the expression of GPR37 is markedly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues. We found that elevated GPR37 expression predicts an unfavorable prognosis. (2) It was demonstrated that GPR37 positively regulates NSCLC cell invasion, migration, and proliferation, suppresses cell apoptosis, heightens resistance to cisplatin, and promotes tumor formation and growth. Conversely, we observed that GPR37 knockdown suppresses NSCLC cell invasion, migration, and proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis, increases sensitivity to cisplatin, and affects tumor formation and growth. (3) GPR37 activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathways to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby promoting the progression of NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: It was suggested that GPR37 acts a crucial role in promoting the occurrence and development of NSCLC. Knockdown of GPR37 significantly inhibits the occurrence and development of NSCLC. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that GPR37 may represent a viable therapeutic target for NSCLC.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of transmembrane proteins that are expressed in many organs and serve as important drug targets. A new subgroup, namely orphan GPCRs, comprising many of these receptors has been discovered. These receptors exhibit diverse physiological functions and have been considered in many neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). GPR17, GPR30, GPR37, GPR40, GPR50, GPR54, GPR56, GPR65, GPR68, GPR75, GPR84, GPR97, GPR109, GPR124, and GPR126 are orphan GPCRs that have been reported with considerable effects in the prevention and/or treatment of MS in preclinical studies. In the present article, we reviewed the most recent findings regarding the role of orphan GPCRs in the treatment of MS.
There are various types of receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have the highest expression with a wide range of physiological functions. A newer sub group of these receptors namely orphan GPCRs have been discovered. GPR3, GPR6, GPR17, GPR26, GPR37, GPR39, GPR40, GPR50, GPR52, GPR54, GPR55, GPR85, GPR88, GPR103, and GPR139 are the selected orphan GPCRs for this article. Their roles in the central nervous system have not been understood well so far. However, recent studies show that they may have very important functions in the CNS. Hence, in the present study, we reviewed most recent findings regarding the physiological roles of the selected orphan GPCRs in the CNS. After a brief presentation of each receptor, considering the results from genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the receptors, their roles in the pathophysiology of different diseases and disorders including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and substance abuse will be discussed. At present, our knowledge regarding the role of GPCRs in the brain is very limited. However, previous limited studies show that orphan GPCRs have an important place in psychopharmacology and these receptors are potential new targets for the treatment of major CNS diseases.
GPR37 (also known as Pael-R) and GPR37L1 are orphan G protein-coupled receptors that are almost exclusively expressed in the nervous system. We screened these receptors for potential activation by various orphan neuropeptides, and these screens yielded a single positive hit: prosaptide, which promoted the endocytosis of GPR37 and GPR37L1, bound to both receptors and activated signaling in a GPR37- and GPR37L1-dependent manner. Prosaptide stimulation of cells transfected with GPR37 or GPR37L1 induced the phosphorylation of ERK in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, stimulated (35)S-GTPgammaS binding, and promoted the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Because prosaptide is the active fragment of the secreted neuroprotective and glioprotective factor prosaposin (also known as sulfated glycoprotein-1), we purified full-length prosaposin and found that it also stimulated GPR37 and GPR37L1 signaling. Moreover, both prosaptide and prosaposin were found to protect primary astrocytes against oxidative stress, with these protective effects being attenuated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous astrocytic GPR37 or GPR37L1. These data reveal that GPR37 and GPR37L1 are receptors for the neuroprotective and glioprotective factors prosaptide and prosaposin.
OBJECTIVE: alpha-Synuclein has been studied as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD) with no concluding results. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to find out reliable specific biomarkers for PD. GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that toxically accumulates in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. Here, we investigated whether GPR37 is upregulated in sporadic PD, and thus a suitable potential biomarker for PD. METHODS: GPR37 protein density and mRNA expression in postmortem substantia nigra (SN) from PD patients were analysed by immunoblot and RT-qPCR, respectively. The presence of peptides from the N-terminus-cleaved domain of GPR37 (i.e. ecto-GPR37) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis. An engineered in-house nanoluciferase-based immunoassay was used to quantify ecto-GPR37 in CSF samples from neurological control (NC) subjects, PD patients and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. RESULTS: GPR37 protein density and mRNA expression were significantly augmented in sporadic PD. Increased amounts of ecto-GPR37 peptides in the CSF samples from PD patients were identified by mass spectrometry and quantified by the in-house ELISA method. However, the CSF total alpha-synuclein level in PD patients did not differ from that in NC subjects. Similarly, the cortical GPR37 mRNA expression and CSF ecto-GPR37 levels in AD patients were also unaltered. CONCLUSION: GPR37 expression is increased in SN of sporadic PD patients. The ecto-GPR37 peptides are significantly increased in the CSF of PD patients, but not in AD patients. These results open perspectives and encourage further clinical studies to confirm the validity and utility of ecto-GPR37 as a potential PD biomarker.
Neurological disorders and pain are prevalent clinical issues that severely impact patients' quality of life and daily functioning. With the advancing exploration of these disease mechanisms, G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) has emerged as a critical protein, garnering widespread attention in the scientific community. As a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, GPR37 features a seven-transmembrane helix structure and is widely expressed in various brain regions, including the substantia nigra and striatum. In addition to neurons, GPR37 is also detected in immune cells within the nervous system, indicating its potential role in neuron-immune cell interactions. Research has shown that the expression level of GPR37 in neurological disorders can affect neuron survival, cellular signaling, and overall neurological health. Abnormal expression of GPR37 is often associated with disease progression and symptom exacerbation in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and stroke. In the context of pain, GPR37 alleviates pain and inflammatory responses by regulating the phagocytic activity and polarization state of macrophages. This article aims to delve into the mechanistic roles of GPR37 in neurological disorders and pain. Through a comprehensive literature review, we summarize the latest research on GPR37's involvement in neurological diseases and pain, highlighting its critical roles in neural signaling, inflammatory responses, and neuroprotection. This understanding expands the comprehension of GPR37's biological functions and provides new perspectives for improving the clinical outcomes of patients with neurological disorders and pain.
Metastatic lesions leading causes of the majority of deaths in patients with the breast cancer. The present study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain (MDA-MB-231 BrM2) and lung (MDA-MB-231 LM2) metastatic cell lines obtained from breast cancer patients compared with those who have primary breast cancer. We identified 981 and 662 DEGs for brain and lung metastasis, respectively. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed seven shared (PLCB1, FPR1, FPR2, CX3CL1, GABBR2, GPR37, and CXCR4) hub genes between brain and lung metastasis in breast cancer. Moreover, GNG2 and CXCL8, C3, and PTPN6 in the brain and SAA1 and CCR5 in lung metastasis were found as unique hub genes. Besides, five co-regulation of clusters via seven important co-expression genes (COL1A2, LUM, SPARC, THBS2, IL1B, CXCL8, THY1) were identified in the brain PPI network. Clusters screening followed by biological process (BP) function and pathway enrichment analysis for both metastatic cell lines showed that complement receptor signalling, acetylcholine receptor signalling, and gastric acid secretion pathways were common between these metastases, whereas other pathways were site-specific. According to our findings, there are a set of genes and functional pathways that mark and mediate breast cancer metastasis to the brain and lungs, which may enable us understand the molecular basis of breast cancer development in a deeper levele to the brain and lungs, which may help us gain a more complete understanding of the molecular underpinnings of breast cancer development.
