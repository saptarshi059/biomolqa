Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2; Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Constitutively expressed in some tissues in physiological conditions, such as the endothelium, kidney and brain, and in pathological conditions, such as in cancer. PTGS2 is responsible for production of inflammatory prostaglandins. Up-regulation of PTGS2 is also associated with increased cell adhesion, phenotypic changes, resistance to apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis. In cancer cells, PTGS2 is a key step in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays imp [...] 
Omega and subterminal hydroxylations of prostaglandins (PGs), leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and some related eicosanoids are catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes belonging to the CYP4A and CYP4F subfamilies. CYP4A4, which is induced in pregnant rabbits, is the only elucidated PGE omega-hydroxylase within the CYP4A subfamily. CYP4F3 is the most tissue specific and most efficient LTB4 omega-hydroxylase, judging from its restricted localization in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and its very low Km value for LTB4. CYP4F2 is widely distributed in human liver and other tissues, and catalyzes omega-hydroxylation of various lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids as well as LTB4, with relatively comparable and high Km values. CYP4F3B is very similar to CYP4F2 in its tissue localization and its Km value for LTB4. Human seminal vesicle CYP4F8 is the first elucidated hydroxylase with substrate specificity for PG endoperoxides, whereas ram seminal vesicle CYP4F21 is the only elucidated PGE omega-hydroxylase within the CYP4F subfamily [corrected]. Rat CYP4F1, CYP4F4 and CYP4F5, and mouse Cyp4f14 have LTB4 omega-hydroxylase activity. Three additional human, four mouse, and one fish members of the CYP4F subfamily have been identified.
We report the synthesis of seven new proluciferins for convenient activity determination of enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4 family. Biotransformation of these probe substrates was monitored using each of the twelve human CYP4 family members, and eight were found to act at least on one of them. For all substrates, activity of CYP4Z1 was always highest, while that of CYP4F8 was always second highest. Site of metabolism (SOM) predictions involving SMARTCyp and docking experiments helped to rationalize the observed activity trends linked to substrate accessibility and reactivity. We further report the first homology model of CYP4F8 including suggested substrate recognition residues in a catalytically competent conformation accessed by replica exchange solute tempering (REST) simulations.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in bladder cancer (BC), as well as determine their prognostic value. METHODS: LncRNA expression data and clinical data from BC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. R software was used to carry out principal component analysis (PCA), differential analysis, and prognostic analysis. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential prognostic genes. The expression of five identified genes and their correlation with prognosis were verified using TCGA and GSE13507 datasets. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression of these five genes in cell lines (two human BC cell lines and one human bladder epithelial cell line) and tissues (84 pairs of BC tissues and the corresponding paracancerous tissues). Risk scores that had been generated from the five genes and their prognostic ability were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. Co-expressed genes were screened by WGCNA and analyzed by GO and KEGG, while functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses were performed using STRING ( https://cn.string-db.org/ ) and TIMER2.0 ( http://timer.cistrome.org/ ) online tools, respectively. RESULTS: CYP4F8, FAR2P1, LINC01518, LINC01764, and DTNA were identified as potential prognostic genes. We found that these five genes were differentially expressed in BC tissue, as well as in BC cell lines, and were significantly correlated with the prognosis of BC patients. KM analysis considering risk scores as independent parameters revealed differences in overall survival (OS) by subgroups. The ROC curve revealed that a combined model consisting of all five genes had good predictive ability at 1, 3, and 5 years. GO and KEGG analyses of 567 co-expressed genes revealed that these genes were significantly associated with muscle function. CONCLUSION: LncRNAs can be good predictors of BC development and prognosis, and may act as potential tumor markers and therapeutic targets that may be beneficial in helping clinicians decide the most effective treatment strategies.
BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent malignancy affecting the urinary system and poses a significant burden in terms of both incidence and mortality rates on a global scale. Among all BLCA cases, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer constitutes approximately 75% of the total. In recent years, the concept of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death marked by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, has captured the attention of researchers worldwide. Nevertheless, the precise involvement of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in the anti-BLCA response remains inadequately elucidated. METHODS: The integration of BLCA samples from the TCGA and GEO datasets facilitated the quantitative evaluation of FRGs, offering potential insights into their predictive capabilities. Leveraging the wealth of information encompassing mRNAsi, gene mutations, CNV, TMB, and clinical features within these datasets further enriched the analysis, augmenting its robustness and reliability. Through the utilization of Lasso regression, a prediction model was developed, enabling accurate prognostic assessments within the context of BLCA. Additionally, co-expression analysis shed light on the complex relationship between gene expression patterns and FRGs, unraveling their functional relevance and potential implications in BLCA. RESULTS: FRGs exhibited increased expression levels in the high-risk cohort of BLCA patients, even in the absence of other clinical indicators, suggesting their potential as prognostic markers. GSEA revealed enrichment of immunological and tumor-related pathways specifically in the high-risk group. Furthermore, notable differences were observed in immune function and m6a gene expression between the low- and high-risk groups. Several genes, including MYBPH, SOST, SPRR2A, and CRNN, were found to potentially participate in the oncogenic processes underlying BLCA. Additionally, CYP4F8, PDZD3, CRTAC1, and LRTM1 were identified as potential tumor suppressor genes. Significant discrepancies in immunological function and m6a gene expression were observed between the two risk groups, further highlighting the distinct molecular characteristics associated with different prognostic outcomes. Notably, strong correlations were observed among the prognostic model, CNVs, SNPs, and drug sensitivity profiles. CONCLUSIONS: FRGs are associated with the onset and progression of BLCA. A FRGs signature offers a viable alternative to predict BLCA, and these FRGs show a prospective research area for BLCA targeted treatment in the future.
CYP4F22 and CYP4F8 are expressed in epidermis, and mutations of CYP4F22 are associated with lamellar ichthyosis. Epoxyalcohols (HEETs) and epoxides (EETs) of 20:4n-6 appear to be important for the water permeability barrier of skin. Our aim was to study the MS/MS spectra and fragmentation of these compounds and to determine whether they were oxidized by CYP4F22 or CYP4F8 expressed in yeast. HEETs were prepared from 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), 12-HPETE, and their [(2)H(8)]labeled isotopomers, and separated by normal phase-HPLC with MS/MS analysis. CYP4F22 oxygenated 20:4n-6 at C-18, whereas metabolites of HEETs could not be identified. CYP4F8 formed omega3 hydroxy metabolites of HEETs derived from 12R-HPETE with 11,12-epoxy-10-hydroxy configuration, but not HEETs derived from 15S-HPETE. 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET were also subject to omega3 hydroxylation by CYP4F8. We conclude that CYP4F8 and CYP4F22 oxidize 20:4n-6 and that CYP4F8 selectively oxidizes 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 10,11R,12R-HEET at the omega3 position.
cDNA of a novel human cytochrome P450 was cloned from human liver by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and designated CYP4F12. The open reading frame coded for 524 amino acids, and the sequence could be aligned with 78-83% amino acid identity to the four human CYP4F enzymes (CYP4F2, CYP4F3, CYP4F8 and CYP4F11). Northern blot analysis suggested three major transcripts of CYP4F12, which were detected in liver, kidney, colon, small intestine and heart. The CYP4F12 gene contained 13 exons and was located at chromosome 19p13.1. CYP4F12, expressed in yeast, oxidized arachidonic acid to 18-hydroxyarachidonic acid, and the omega-side chain of two stable prostaglandin (PG) H(2) analogs (11,9-epoxymethano-PGH(2) and 9,11-diazo-15-deoxy-PGH(2)). CYP4F12 oxidized the omega-side chain of leukotriene B(4), PGE(2), PGF(2 alpha), PGH(2), and 9,11-epoxymethano-PGH(2) poorly. Several CYP4F enzymes are important omega 1- and omega 2-hydroxylases of eicosanoids. The physiological function of CYP4F12 merits further investigation.
Ram semen contains high concentrations of PGE1, PGE2, 20-hydroxy-PGE1, and 20-hydroxy-PGE2, which mainly originate from the ram seminal vesicles. The 20-hydroxy-PGE compounds are formed by a tentatively identified cytochrome P450, designated PGE2 20-hydroxylase. Our aim was to clone the enzyme and express it in yeast. Total RNA was isolated from ram seminal vesicle. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers for the CYP4 family yielded a novel cDNA sequence of a cytochrome P450. The full coding region (1584 bp) was cloned by RT-PCR and designated CYP4F21. The deduced protein sequence of CYP4F21 contained 528 amino acids and showed 74% amino acid identity with CYP4F8 of human seminal vesicles. CYP4F21 was expressed in yeast, and its catalytic properties were studied by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Recombinant CYP4F21 oxidizes three stable PGH2 analogs (U44069, U46619, and U51605) and PGE2 to their 20-hydroxy metabolites, whereas PGH1, PGH2, PGE1, and PGF2alpha appeared to be poor substrates. The apparent Km for hydroxylation of PGE2 was 0.05 mM. Microsomes of ram seminal vesicles and NADPH metabolized PGE2 and the three PGH2 analogs essentially in the same way as CYP4F21. Our results suggest that CYP4F21 might be a sheep homolog to CYP4F8 of human seminal vesicles. The reproductive function of CYP4F21 is likely to biosynthesize 20-hydroxy-PGE1 and 20-hydroxy-PGE2, which is excreted by the seminal vesicles.
Recombinant CYP4F8 and CYP4F12 metabolize prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) analogs by omega2- and omega3-hydroxylation and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) by omega3-hydroxylation. CYP4F8 was found to catalyze epoxidation of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) and omega3-hydroxylation of 22:5n-6. CYP4F12 oxidized 22:6n-3 and 22:5n-3 in the same way, but 22:5n-6 was a poor substrate. The products were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The missense mutation 374A>T of CYP4F8 (Tyr125Phe in substrate recognition site-1 (SRS-1)) occurs in low frequency. This variant oxidized two PGH2 analogs, U-51605 and U-44069, in analogy with CYP4F8, but 20:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 were not oxidized. CYP4F enzymes with omega-hydroxylase activity contain a heme-binding Glu residue, whereas CYP4F8 (and CYP4F12) with omega2- and omega 3-hydroxylase activities has a Gly residue in this position of SRS-4. The mutant CYP4F8 Gly328Glu oxidized U-51605 and U-44069 as recombinant CYP4F8, but the hydroxylation of arachidonic acid was shifted from C-18 to C-19. Single amino acid substitutions in SRS-1 and SRS-4 of CYP4F8 may thus influence oxygenation of certain substrates. We conclude that CYP4F8 and CYP4F12 catalyze epoxidation of 22:6n-3 and 22:5n-3, and CYP4F8 omega3-hydroxylation of 22:5n-6.
Breast cancer is among the lethal types of cancer with a high mortality rate, globally. Its high prevalence can be controlled through improved analysis and identification of disease-specific biomarkers. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as key contributors of carcinogenesis and regulate various cellular pathways through post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. The specific aim of this study was to identify the novel interactions of aberrantly expressed genetic components in breast cancer by applying integrative analysis of publicly available expression profiles of both lncRNAs and mRNAs. Differential expression patterns were identified by comparing the breast cancer expression profiles of samples with controls. Significant co-expression networks were identified through WGCNA analysis. WGCNA is a systems biology approach used to elucidate the pattern of correlation between genes across microarray samples. It is also used to identify the highly correlated modules. The results obtained from this study revealed significantly differentially expressed and co-expressed lncRNAs and their cis- and trans-regulating mRNA targets which include RP11-108F13.2 targeting TAF5L, RPL23AP2 targeting CYP4F3, CYP4F8 and AL022324.2 targeting LRP5L, AL022324.3, and Z99916.3, respectively. Moreover, pathway analysis revealed the involvement of identified mRNAs and lncRNAs in major cell signalling pathways, and target mRNAs expression is also validated through cohort data. Thus, the identified lncRNAs and their target mRNAs represent novel biomarkers that could serve as potential therapeutics for breast cancer and their roles could also be further validated through wet labs to employ them as potential therapeutic targets in future.
The predominating prostaglandins of human seminal fluid are 19R-hydroxyprostaglandins E1 and E2, conceivably formed sequentially by prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase-2, PGH 19-hydroxylase (CYP4F8), and microsomal PGE synthase-1 of seminal vesicles. Our aim was to study this enzyme system. Quantification by real-time PCR suggested that the transcripts of PGH synthase-2, CYP4F8, and microsomal PGE synthase-1 were abundant and correlated in seminal vesicles of seven patients (p < 0.05). The three enzymes were detected in seminal vesicles by Western blot analysis, and immunohistological analysis confirmed the localization to the epithelia of seminal vesicles and distal vas deferens. Immunofluorescence analysis showed co-localization of the three enzymes in epithelial cells of seminal vesicles and vas deferens. 19-Hydroxy-PGE compounds were detected by mass spectrometry in the mucosa of distal vas deferens. Recombinant CYP4F8 catalyzes n-2 hydroxylation of PGH1 and PGH2 and n-3 hydroxylation of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid was oxidized to 18-hydroxyarachidonic acid and to PGE2 and by microsomes of seminal vesicles in the presence of NADPH and GSH, and to relatively small amounts of 19-hydroxy-PGE2. We conclude that PGH synthase-2, CYP4F8, and PGE synthase-1 likely forms 19-hydroxy-PGE compounds in seminal vesicles and vas deferens, but the catalytic properties of CYP4F8 suggest additional biological functions. Recombinant CYP4F8 was also found to catalyze n-2 hydroxylation of PGI2 and carbaprostacyclin (Km to approximately 40 microM), and n-2 and n-3 hydroxylation of carbocyclic TXA2.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cytochrome P450 4F8 (CYP4F8), and microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) form PGE and 19-hydroxy-PGE in human seminal vesicles. We have examined COX-2, CYP4F8, and mPGES-1 in normal skin and in psoriasis. All three enzymes were detected in epidermis by immunofluorescence and co-localized in the suprabasal cell layers. In lesional psoriasis the enzymes were also co-localized in the basal cell layers. Real-time RT-PCR analysis suggested that CYP4F8 mRNA was induced 15-fold in lesional compared to non-lesional epidermis. mRNA of all enzymes were present in cultured HEK and HaCaT cells, but the prominent induction of CYP4F8 mRNA in psoriasis could not be mimicked by treatment of these keratinocytes with a mixture of inflammatory cytokines or with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. The function of CYP4F8 in epidermis might be related to lipid oxidation and keratinocyte proliferation.
A novel cytochrome P450, CYP4F8, was recently cloned from human seminal vesicles. CYP4F8 was expressed in yeast. Recombinant CYP4F8 oxygenated arachidonic acid to (18R)-hydroxyarachidonate, whereas prostaglandin (PG) D(2), PGE(1), PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and leukotriene B(4) appeared to be poor substrates. Three stable PGH(2) analogues, 9,11-epoxymethano-PGH(2) (U-44069), 11, 9-epoxymethano-PGH(2) (U-46619), and 9,11-diazo-15-deoxy-PGH(2) (U-51605) were rapidly metabolized by omega2- and omega3-hydroxylation. U-44069 was oxygenated with a V(max) of approximately 260 pmol min(-)(1) pmol P450(-1) and a K(m) of approximately 7 micrometer. PGH(2) decomposes mainly to PGE(2) in buffer and to PGF(2alpha) by reduction with SnCl(2). CYP4F8 metabolized PGH(2) to 19-hydroxy-PGH(2), which decomposed to 19-hydroxy-PGE(2) in buffer and could be reduced to 19-hydroxy-PGF(2alpha) with SnCl(2). 18-Hydroxy metabolites were also formed (approximately 17%). PGH(1) was metabolized to 19- and 18-hydroxy-PGH(1) in the same way. Microsomes of human seminal vesicles oxygenated arachidonate, U-44069, U-46619, U-51605, and PGH(2), similar to CYP4F8. (19R)-Hydroxy-PGE(1) and (19R)-hydroxy-PGE(2) are the main prostaglandins of human seminal fluid. We propose that they are formed by CYP4F8-catalyzed omega2-hydroxylation of PGH(1) and PGH(2) in the seminal vesicles and isomerization to (19R)-hydroxy-PGE by PGE synthase. CYP4F8 is the first described hydroxylase with specificity and catalytic competence for prostaglandin endoperoxides.
OBJECTIVES: Response to the oncology drug gemcitabine may be variable in part due to genetic differences in the enzymes and transporters responsible for its metabolism and disposition. The aim of our in-silico study was to identify gene variants significantly associated with gemcitabine response that may help to personalize treatment in the clinic. METHODS: We analyzed two independent data sets: (a) genotype data from NCI-60 cell lines using the Affymetrix DMET 1.0 platform combined with gemcitabine cytotoxicity data in those cell lines, and (b) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from 351 pancreatic cancer patients treated on an NCI-sponsored phase III clinical trial. We also performed a subset analysis on the GWAS data set for 135 patients who were given gemcitabine+placebo. Statistical and systems biology analyses were performed on each individual data set to identify biomarkers significantly associated with gemcitabine response. RESULTS: Genetic variants in the ABC transporters (ABCC1, ABCC4) and the CYP4 family members CYP4F8 and CYP4F12, CHST3, and PPARD were found to be significant in both the NCI-60 and GWAS data sets. We report significant association between drug response and variants within members of the chondroitin sulfotransferase family (CHST) whose role in gemcitabine response is yet to be delineated. CONCLUSION: Biomarkers identified in this integrative analysis may contribute insights into gemcitabine response variability. As genotype data become more readily available, similar studies can be conducted to gain insights into drug response mechanisms and to facilitate clinical trial design and regulatory reviews.
Our aim was to determine the tissue distribution of CYP4F8, which occurs in human seminal vesicles and catalyzes 19-hydroxylation of prostaglandin H(1) and H(2) in vitro (J. Bylund, M. Hidestrard, M. Ingelman-Sundberg, E.H. Oliw, J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000) 21844-21849). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against RVEPLG, the C-terminal end of CYP4F8, and purified by affinity chromatography. Screening of 50 human tissues for CYP4F8 immunoreactivity revealed protein expression, inter alia, in seminal vesicles, epidermis, hair follicles, sweat glands, corneal epithelium, proximal renal tubules, and epithelial linings of the gut and urinary tract. The CYP4F8 transcripts were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and by Northern blot analysis. There was a prominent induction of CYP4F8 immunoreactivity and mRNA in psoriasis in comparison with unaffected epidermis of the same patients. The cDNA of CYP4F8 from plucked scalp hair roots was identical with the genital cDNA sequence. We conclude that CYP4F8 is present in epithelial linings and up regulated in epidermis of psoriatic lesions.
The arachidonic acid and prostaglandin pathway has been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis, but comprehensive studies of the individual members in this key pathway are lacking. Here, we first conducted a systematic bioinformatic study of the expression of 36 arachidonic acid pathway genes across 9783 human tissue samples. The results showed that the PLA2G7, HPGD, EPHX2, and CYP4F8 genes are highly expressed in prostate cancer. Functional studies using RNA interference in prostate cancer cells indicated that all four genes are also essential for cell growth and survival. Clinical validation confirmed high PLA2G7 expression, especially in ERG oncogene-positive prostate cancers, and its silencing sensitized ERG-positive prostate cancer cells to oxidative stress. HPGD was highly expressed in androgen receptor (AR)-overexpressing advanced tumors, as well as in metastatic prostate cancers. EPHX2 mRNA correlated with AR in primary prostate cancers, and its inhibition in vitro reduced AR signaling and potentiated the effect of antiandrogen flutamide in cultured prostate cancer cells. In summary, we identified four novel putative therapeutic targets with biomarker potential for different subtypes of prostate cancer. In addition, our results indicate that inhibition of these enzymes may be particularly powerful when combined with other treatments, such as androgen deprivation or induction of oxidative stress.
Inflammation can influence the development of CRC as well as immunotherapy and plays a key role in CRC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential of inflammation-related genes in CRC risk prediction. Inflammation gene models were constructed and validated by combining transcriptomic and single-cell data from TCGA and GEO databases, and the expression of inflammation-related genes was verified by RT-qPCR. We identified two molecular subtypes and three genetic subtypes, two risk subgroups according to median risk values, constructed a prognostic model including thirteen genes (TIMP1, GDF15, UCN, KRT4, POU4F1, NXPH1, SIX2, NPC1L1, KLK12, IGFL1, FOXD1, ASPG, and CYP4F8), and validated the performance of each aspect of the model in an external database. Patients in the high-risk group had worse survival with reduced immune cell infiltration and a greater tumor mutational load. The risk score correlated strongly with the immune checkpoints PD1, PDL1, PDL2, and CTLA4, and it is possible that high-risk patients are more sensitive to treatment involving immune checkpoints. In the single-cell data, GDF15 was most significantly expressed in cancer cell populations. Therefore, we further validated their expression in cells and tissues using qPCR. In summary, we developed a prognostic marker associated with inflammatory genes to provide new directions for subsequent studies and to help clinicians assess the prognosis of CRC patients as well as to develop personalized treatment strategies.
The objective was to examine the NADPH-dependent oxygenation of prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) and three PGH(2) analogues, 9,11-diazo-15-deoxy-PGH(2) (U51605), 9,11-epoxymethano-PGH(2) (U44069), and 11,9-epoxymethano-PGH(2) (U46619), by cytochromes P450, and to characterize the metabolites by mass spectrometry. CYP2C19, CYP4A11, CYP4F8, and liver and renal cortical microsomes oxidized the omega-side chain of U44069, U46619, and U51605, whereas only CYP4F8 oxidized the omega-side chain of PGH(2). PGH(2) was transformed to four stereoisomers of 5-hydroxy-PGI(1) by recombinant cytochromes P450. CYP4F8 formed the 5-hydroxy-PGI(1) isomers in small amounts compared to the 19-hydroxy metabolites of PGH(2). Isomers of 5-hydroxy-PGI(1) and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) were detectable when PGH(2) decomposed in the presence of hemin, hemoglobin, or heat-inactivated microsomes. 5-Hydroxy-PGI(1) is likely formed from PGH(2) in a pseudo-enzymatic reaction involving homolytic scission of the endoperoxide and formation of an ether between C-9 and C-6 and a carbon-centered radical at C-5, which reacts with molecular oxygen. CYP4F8 catalyzes 19-hydroxylation of PGH(2), but the absolute configuration of the 19-hydroxy group is unknown, whereas human seminal fluid contains (19R)-hydroxy-PGE(2). CYP4F8 was found to metabolize U51605 to 90% of the (19R)-hydroxy metabolite, providing further evidence in favor of a role of CYP4F8 in biosynthesis of (19R)-hydroxy PGE in human seminal vesicles. We conclude that omega-side chain hydroxylation of PGH(2) analogues may be catalyzed by many different cytochromes P450, but only CYP4F8 oxidizes the omega-side chain of PGH(2) efficiently.
A cDNA encoding a novel human CYP4F enzyme (designated CYP4F12) was cloned by PCR from a human small intestine cDNA library. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that CYP4F12 is expressed in human small intestine and liver. This cDNA contains an entire coding region of a 524-amino-acid protein that is 81.7, 78.3, and 78.2% identical to CYP4F2, CYP4F3, and CYP4F8, respectively. When expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the P450 catalyzes leukotriene B(4) omega-hydroxylation and arachidonic acid omega-hydroxylation, typical reactions of CYP4F isoforms. Their activity levels are, however, much lower than those of CYP4F2. Interestingly, CYP4F12 catalyzes the hydroxylation of the antihistamine ebastine with significantly higher catalytic activity relative to CYP4F2 (385 vs 5 pmol/min/nmol P450). These results indicate that CYP4F12 has a different profile of substrate specificity from other CYP4F isoforms, enzymes responsible for metabolizing endogenous autacoids, therefore suggesting that it may play an important role in xenobiotic biotransformation in the human small intestine.
