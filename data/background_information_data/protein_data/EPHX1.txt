Previous family studies suggested that genetic variation contributes to COPD susceptibility. The only gene proven to influence COPD susceptibility is SERPINA1, encoding alpha1-antitrypsin. Most studies on COPD candidate genes except SERPINA1, have not been consistently replicated. However, longitudinal studies of decline in lung function, meta-analyses of candidate gene studies, and family-based linkage analyses suggested that variants in EPHX1, GST, MMP12, TGFB1, and SERPINE2 were associated with susceptibility to COPD. A genome-wide association (GWA) study has recently demonstrated that CHRNA3/5 in 15q25 was associated with COPD compared with control smokers. It was of interest that the CHRNA3/5 locus was associated with nicotine dependence and lung cancer as well. The associations of HHIP on 4q31 and FAM13A on 4q22 with COPD were also suggested in GWA studies. Another GWA study has shown that BICD1 in 12p11 was associated with the presence or absence of emphysema. Although every genetic study on COPD has some limitations including heterogeneity in smoking behaviors and comorbidities, it has contributed to the progress in elucidating the pathogenesis of COPD. Future studies will make us understand the mechanisms underlying the polygenic disease, leading to the development of a specific treatment for each phenotype.
BackgroundEPHX1 gene polymorphisms were recently acknowledged as an important source of individual variability in carbamazepine metabolism, but the result of that association still remains controversial. Aim of the review To obtain a more precise estimation of the associations between EPHX1 polymorphisms and carbamazepine metabolism and resistance. Methods The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, China Biology Medicine disc and Wan fang Database were searched for appropriate studies regarding the rs1051740 and rs2234922 polymorphisms of EPHX1 up to September 2019. The meta-analysis was carried out using the Review Manager 5.3 software. The mean difference and 95% confidence interval were applied to assess the strength of the relationship. Results A total of 7 studies involving 1118 related epilepsy patients were included. EPHX1 rs1051740 polymorphism was significantly associated with adjusted concentrations of both carbamazepine (CC vs. TT: P = 0.02; CC vs. CT + TT: P = 0.005) and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CC vs. CT + TT: P = 0.03). Furthermore, EPHX1 rs2234922 polymorphism was also observed to be significantly associated with decreased adjusted concentrations of carbamazepine-10,11-trans dihydrodiol (GG vs. GA + AA: P = 0.04) and CBZD:CBZE ratio (GG vs. AA: P = 0.008; GG vs. GA + AA: P = 0.0008). Nevertheless, the pooled analysis showed that the EPHX1 polymorphisms had no significant effect on CBZ resistance. Conclusion EPHX1 rs1051740 and rs2234922 polymorphisms may affect the carbamazepine metabolism; but carbamazepine resistance was not related to any of the single nucleotide polymorphisms investigated. These findings provided further evidence for individualized therapy of epilepsy patients in clinics.
Lipids play a major role in inflammatory diseases by altering inflammatory cell functions, either through their function as energy substrates or as lipid mediators such as oxylipins. Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that limits inflammation, is known to impact on lipid availability, however, whether this controls inflammation remains unexplored. We found that upon intestinal inflammation visceral adipocytes upregulate autophagy and that adipocyte-specific loss of the autophagy gene Atg7 exacerbates inflammation. While autophagy decreased lipolytic release of free fatty acids, loss of the major lipolytic enzyme Pnpla2/Atgl in adipocytes did not alter intestinal inflammation, ruling out free fatty acids as anti-inflammatory energy substrates. Instead, Atg7-deficient adipose tissues exhibited an oxylipin imbalance, driven through an NRF2-mediated upregulation of Ephx1. This shift reduced secretion of IL-10 from adipose tissues, which was dependent on the cytochrome P450-EPHX pathway, and lowered circulating levels of IL-10 to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. These results suggest an underappreciated fat-gut crosstalk through an autophagy-dependent regulation of anti-inflammatory oxylipins via the cytochrome P450-EPHX pathway, indicating a protective effect of adipose tissues for distant inflammation.
BACKGROUND: Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) plays an important role in both the activation and detoxification of PAHs, which are carcinogens found in cooked meat and tobacco smoking. Polymorphisms at exons 3 and 4 of the EPHX1 gene have been reported to be associated with variations in EPHX1 activity. The aim of this study is to quantitatively summarize the relationship between EPHX1 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. METHODS: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Databases for studies published before June 2012. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for EPHX1 Tyr113His (rs1051740) and His139Arg (rs2234922) polymorphisms and CRC were calculated in a fixed-effects model and a random-effects model when appropriate. RESULTS: This meta-analysis yielded 14 case-control studies, which included 13 studies for Tyr113His (6395 cases and 7893 controls) and 13 studies for His139Arg polymorphisms (5375 cases and 6962 controls). Overall, the pooled results indicated that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism was not associated with CRC risk; while the His139Arg polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased CRC risk (Arg/His vs. His/His, OR = 0.90, 95%CI = 0.83-0.98; dominant model, OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85-0.99). The statistically significant association between EPHX1 His139Arg polymorphism and CRC was observed among Caucasians and population-based case-control studies. This association showed little heterogeneity and remained consistently strong when analyses were limited to studies in which genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or limited to studies with matched controls. When cumulative meta-analyses of the two associations were conducted by studies' publication time, the results were persistent and robust. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism may be not associated with CRC development; while the EPHX1 His139Arg polymorphism may have a potential protective effect on CRC.
AIM: To summarize the relationship between p.Tyr113His and p.His139Arg polymorphisms in microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) and risk for esophageal cancer (EC). METHODS: The MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of the association between EPHX1 polymorphisms and EC risk that were published from the database inception date to April 2013. A total of seven case-control studies, including seven on p.Tyr113His (cases, n = 1118; controls, n = 1823) and six on p.His139Arg (cases, n = 861; controls, n = 1571), were included in the meta-analysis. After data extraction by two investigators working independently, the meta-analyses were carried out with STATA 11.0 software. Pooled odds ratios and 95%CI were calculated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model, as appropriate. RESULTS: The pooled EPHX1 p.Tyr113His polymorphism data showed no significant association with EC in any of the genetic models (OR = 1.00, 95%CI: 0.70-1.48 for Tyr/His vs Tyr/Tyr; OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 0.77-1.57 for His/His vs Tyr/Tyr; OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.75-1.49 for a dominant model; OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.89-1.34 for a recessive model). Similar results were obtained from the p.His139Arg polymorphism analysis (Arg/His vs His/His: OR = 1.02, 95%CI: 0.84-1.23; Arg/Arg vs His/His: OR = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.60-1.54; OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.78-1.37 for the dominant model; OR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.61-1.56 for the recessive model). Subgroup analyses for ethnicity, subtype of EC, and source of controls (population-based or hospital-based) showed trends that were consistent with the pooled analysis (reported above), with no significant associations found. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that the p.Tyr113His and p.His139Arg polymorphisms in EPHX1 may not be associated with EC development.
AIM: To evaluate the association between the EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms in the EPHX1 gene and the risk of head and neck cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies on the association of EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms with HNC performed up until June 1st, 2014, were identified using a predefined search strategy. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of these associations. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, 10 case-control studies, which included 9 studies of Tyr113His (1890 cases and 1894 controls) and 10 studies of His139Arg polymorphisms (1982 cases and 2024 controls), were considered eligible for inclusion. Overall, the pooled results indicated that the EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism was significantly associated with increased HNC risk (Tyr/His vs. Tyr/Tyr, OR = 1.26, 95%1.02-1.57;His/His+ Tyr/His vs. Tyr/Tyr, OR = 1.29, 95% I = 1.03-1.61). However, no significant association was found between the His139Arg polymorphism and HNC risk. In the subgroup analysis, a statistically significant association between the EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism and HNC was observed in population-based case-control studies (PCC), which involved less than 500 participants and genotype frequencies in HWE. This association showed minimal heterogeneity after excluding studies that were determined to contribute to heterogeneity. After categorizing the studies by publication time, a sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis of the two associations were conducted, and the results of the two analyses were consistent. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism may be a risk factor for HNC, while the EPHX1 His139Arg polymorphism has no association with HNC risk.
The microsomal epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with esophageal cancer (EC) risk, yet the results of these previous results have been inconsistent or controversial. The objective of this study was to explore whether the EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms confer risk to EC. The relevant studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Elsevier Science Direct, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database until May 2013. The association between the EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms and EC risk was pooled by odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). A total of eight case-control studies with 1163 EC patients and 1868 controls (seven studies for both Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms, one study only for Tyr113His polymorphism) were eventually identified. We found no association between EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms and EC risk in overall population (For Tyr113His: His vs. Tyr: OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.95-1.15, P = 0.379; His/His vs. Tyr/Tyr: OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.88-1.22, P = 0.208; His/Tyr vs. Tyr/Tyr: OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.80-1.15, P = 0.577; His/His vs. His/Tyr + Tyr/Tyr: OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 0.96-1.26, P = 0.164; His/His + His/Tyr vs. Tyr/Tyr: OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.90-1.12, P = 0.543. For His139Arg: Arg vs. His: OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.94-1.14, P = 0.465; Arg/Arg vs. His/His: OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.91-1.24, P = 0.470; Arg/His vs. His/His: OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 0.91-1.16, P = 0.673; Arg/Arg vs. Arg/His + His/His: OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.85-1.27, P = 0.708; Arg/Arg + Arg/His vs. His/His: OR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.93-1.13, P = 0.617). In subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, significant association has been found in neither EPHX1 Tyr113His nor His139Arg polymorphism. The current meta-analysis suggests no evidence of association between the EPHX1 polymorphism and EC risk.
To clarify the association between microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene (EPHX1) Tyr113His polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, a meta-analysis was performed. Overall, EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism was associated with increased risk of HCC. Subgroup analyses by status of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls further confirmed this association. Through a literature search, 119 relevant records were identified, and 17 individual case-control studies from 13 publications were finally included, involving a total of 1,480 HCC cases and 2,564 controls. In subgroup analyses, increased associations were found in Asians, Caucasians, hepatitis B virus (HBV)- dominant areas, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-dominant areas, high-rate areas of HCC, and medium-rate areas of HCC, but not in Africans and low-rate areas of HCC, respectively. This meta-analysis suggests that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism contributes to HCC risk.
Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) is an evolutionarily highly conserved biotransformation enzyme for converting epoxides to diols. Notably, the enzyme is able to either detoxify or bioactivate a wide range of substrates. Mutations and polymorphic variants in the EPHX1 gene have been associated with susceptibility to several human diseases including cancer. This review summarizes the key knowledge concerning EPHX1 gene and protein structure, expression pattern and regulation, and substrate specificity. The relevance of EPHX1 for human pathology is especially discussed.
BACKGROUND: Microsomal epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) plays an important role in both the activation and detoxification of tobacco-derived carcinogens. Polymorphisms at exons 3 and 4 of the EPHX1 gene have been reported to be associated with variations in EPHX1 activity. The aim of this study is to review and summarize the available molecular epidemiologic studies of lung cancer and EPHX1. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Current Contents, and Web of Science databases for studies published before August 2004. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 case-control studies. Summary odds ratios and summary prevalence of the variant allele (genotype) of both polymorphisms in the EPHX1 gene were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird method. RESULTS: The low-activity (variant) genotype of EPHX1 polymorphism at exon 3 was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio = 0.65; 95% confidence interval = 0.44-0.96) in lung cancer risk among whites. In white populations, the high-activity (variant) genotype of EPHX1 polymorphism at exon 4 was associated with a modest increase in risk of lung cancer (1.22; 0.79-1.90) and the predicted low activity was associated with a modest decrease in risk (0.72; 0.43-1.22). CONCLUSIONS: EPHX1 enzyme may act as a phase I enzyme in lung carcinogenesis. The low-activity genotype of EPHX1 gene is associated with decreased risk of lung cancer among whites.
The gene polymorphisms of ABCB1, EPHX1, and SCN1A were found to influence carbamazepine (CBZ) metabolism and resistance in epilepsy patients, but the relevance remains controversial. To reveal the relationships among the gene polymorphisms of ABCB1, EPHX1, SCN1A and the metabolism and resistance of CBZ, the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technique Journals, China Biology medicine disc and Wan Fang were retrieved for suitable studies up to April 2021. 18 studies containing 3293 epilepsy patients were included. The result revealed the gene polymorphism of ABCB1 c.3435C > T is significantly associated with altered concentration-dose ratios of CBZ (CDR(CBZ)) (CC vs. CT, OR = 0.25 (95% CI: 0.08-0.42), P = 0.004), and EPHX c.416A > G gene polymorphism may also significantly adjusted the concentration-dose ratios of carbamazepine-10, 11-trans dihydrodiol (CDR(CBZD)) (AA vs. GG, OR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.01-0.96), P = 0.045; AG vs. GG, OR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.16-1.20), P = 0.010, respectively) and the ratio of CBZD:carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) (CDR(CBZD):CDR(CBZE)) (AG vs GG, OR = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.31-1.36), P = 0.002). Furthermore, ABCB1 c.3435C > T polymorphism was also observed to be significantly influenced CBZ resistance (CC vs TT, OR = 1.78 (95% CI: 1.17-2.72), P = 0.008; CT vs TT, OR = 1.60 (95% CI: 1.12-2.30), P = 0.01; CC + CT vs TT, OR = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.15-2.26), P = 0.006, respectively). Therefore, CBZ metabolism and resistance in patients with epilepsy may be adjusted by the gene polymorphisms of ABCB1 c.3435C > T and EPHX1 c.416A > G which provides the further scientific basis for clinical individualized therapy of epilepsy. However, larger sample size studies are still needed to provide further conclusive evidence.
BACKGROUND: Previous studies have detected the association of polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes EPHX1 and MnSOD with pre-eclampsia (PE) risk, but the results are inconsistent among studies. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to obtain more conclusive results. METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and CNKI. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to evaluate the relationship between EPHX1 rs1051740, EPHX1 rs2234922, MnSOD rs4880 polymorphisms, and PE susceptibility in the genetic models. The subgroup analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies with a total of 4250 participants were included, including 1784 PE patients and 2466 healthy women. There was a statistically significant association between EPHX1 rs1051740 polymorphism and PE in Caucasians within the allele, dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous models (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.64-0.98; OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.47-0.87; OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44-0.85; OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.42-0.97, respectively). There was a statistically significant association between EPHX1 rs2234922 polymorphism and PE in Middle Easterners within the recessive and homozygous models (OR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.25-10.32; OR = 3.99, 95% CI = 1.38-11.49, respectively). There was no statistically significant association between MnSOD rs4880 polymorphism and PE within five genetic models. Subgroup analysis didn't reveal any association between MnSOD rs4880 polymorphism and PE in Asians, Caucasians, or Middle Easterners. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows a significant association between the EPHX1 rs1051740 and PE risk in Caucasians. Meantime, there was a statistically significant association between EPHX1 rs2234922 polymorphism and PE in Middle Easterners.
INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major public health concern and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. In the case of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), ADRs constitute a barrier to successful treatment since they decrease treatment adherence and impact patients' quality of life of patients. Pharmacogenetics aims to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with drug safety. This article presents a review of genes coding for drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters, and HLA system genes that have been linked to AED-induced ADRs. DEVELOPMENT: To date, several genetic variations associated with drug safety have been reported: CYP2C9*2 and *3 alleles, which code for enzymes with decreased activity, have been linked to phenytoin (PHT)-induced neurotoxicity; GSTM1 null alleles with hepatotoxicity induced by carbamazepine (CBZ) and valproic acid (VPA); EPHX1 polymorphisms with teratogenesis; ABCC2 genetic variations with CBZ- and VPA-induced neurological ADRs; and HLA alleles (e.g. HLA-B*15:02, -A*31:01, -B*15:11, -C*08:01) with cutaneous ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: Published findings show that there are ADRs with a pharmacogenetic basis and a high interethnic variability, which indicates a need for future studies in different populations to gather more useful results for larger number of patients. The search for biomarkers that would allow predicting ADRs to AEDs could improve pharmacotherapy for epilepsy.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered over 75 genomic loci associated with risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but identification of the underlying causal genes remains challenging. Studies of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from LOAD patients have demonstrated the existence of neuronal cell-intrinsic functional defects. Here, we searched for genetic contributions to neuronal dysfunction in LOAD using an integrative systems approach that incorporated multi-evidence-based gene mapping and network-analysis-based prioritization. A systematic perturbation screening of candidate risk genes in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) revealed that neuronal knockdown of the LOAD risk gene orthologs vha-10 (ATP6V1G2), cmd-1 (CALM3), amph-1 (BIN1), ephx-1 (NGEF), and pho-5 (ACP2) alters short-/intermediate-term memory function, the cognitive domain affected earliest during LOAD progression. These results highlight the impact of LOAD risk genes on evolutionarily conserved memory function, as mediated through neuronal endosomal dysfunction, and identify new targets for further mechanistic interrogation.
BACKGROUND: Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a wildly used anti-epileptic drug (AED). Increasing evidence suggested that polymorphisms in Epoxide Hydrolase1 (EPHX1) gene are associated with the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of CBZ, albeit the results were inconsistent. METHODS: A literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library was conducted to identify eligible studies published between 1974 and 2020. A meta-analysis was performed and the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model. The heterogeneity and leave-one-study-out sensitivity analyses of each article and the publication bias were also performed. All the statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.0. RESULTS: A total of 6 articles with 1746 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A significant correlation was detected between EPHX1 rs1051740 T > C polymorphisms and decreased plasma concentration of CBZ (TT vs CC: SMD = 0.34, P < 0.001; TC vs CC: SMD = 0.35, P = 0.009). However, similar results were not detected in the comparison of TT vs. TC in the EPHX1 rs1051740 T > C variation (P = 0.637), while subgroup analyses showed an association with plasma CBZ concentration in the non-Asian group (P < 0.001, I(2) = 0.0%, Ph = 0.400). Although the association of EPHX1 rs2234922 A > G polymorphisms with plasma CBZ concentration was not detected (AA vs GG:SMD = 0.54, P = 0.102; AA vs AG:SMD = -0.05, P = 0.670; AG vs GG: SMD = 0.86, P = 0.107), subgroup analyses showed that the GG genotype EPHX1 rs2234922 was associated with increased plasma CBZ concentration in the Asian group (P = 0.005, I(2) = 48.6%, Ph = 0.143). CONCLUSION: EPHX1 rs1051740 T > C and rs2234922 A > G are important genetic variants associated with plasma CBZ concentration. The role of EPHX1 polymorphisms in the interindividual variability of plasma CBZ concentration varied significantly among different ethnic groups, which should be considered during clinical validation and in future studies.
Intrahepatic cholestasis, or impairment of bile flow, is an important manifestation of inherited and acquired liver disease. In recent years, human genetic and molecular studies have identified several genes, the disruption of which results in cholestasis. ATP8B1 (FIC1), ABCB11 (BSEP), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are disrupted in forms of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and related disorders. Mutations in BAAT, TJP2 (ZO-2), and EPHX1 have been identified in patients with hypercholanemia. A CLDN1 mutation was recently reported in patients with ichthyosis, leukocyte vacuoles, alopecia and sclerosing cholangitis (ILVASC), and North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC) is associated with a missense mutation in CIRH1A. Alagille syndrome patients carry mutations in JAG1, and mutations in VPS33B have been identified in patients with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis syndrome (ARC). Identification of these genes, and characterization of the proteins they encode, is enhancing our understanding of the biology of the enterohepatic circulation in health and disease.
The PharmacoScan pharmacogenomics platform screens for variation in genes that affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, immune adverse reactions and targets. Among the 1,191 genes tested on the platform, 12 genes are expressed in the red cell membrane: ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCG2, CFTR, SLC16A1, SLC19A1, SLC29A1, ATP7A, CYP4F3, EPHX1 and FLOT1. These genes represent 5 ATP-binding cassette proteins, 3 solute carrier proteins, 1 ATP transport protein and 3 genes associated with drug metabolism and adverse drug reactions. Only ABCG2 and SLC29A1 encode blood group systems, JR and AUG, respectively. We propose red cells as an ex vivo model system to study the effect of heritable variants in genes encoding the transport proteins on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Altered pharmacodynamics in red cells could also cause adverse reactions, such as haemolysis, hitherto unexplained by other mechanisms.
BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the predominant subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a pervasive global public health concern. Disulfidoptosis, a nascent form of regulated cell death (RCD), presents an emerging field of inquiry. Currently, investigations into disulfidoptosis are in their initial stages. Our undertaking sought to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in conjunction with traditional bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) methodologies, with the objective of delineating genes associated with disulfidoptosis and subsequently prognosticating the clinical outcomes of LUAD patients. METHODS: Initially, we conducted an in-depth examination of the cellular composition disparities existing between LUAD and normal samples using scRNA-seq data sourced from GSE149655. Simultaneously, we scrutinized the expression patterns of disulfidoptosis-associated gene sets across diverse cell types. Subsequently, leveraging the bulk RNA-seq data, we formulated disulfidoptosis-related prognostic risk signatures (DRPS) employing LASSO-Cox regression. This was accomplished by focusing on genes implicated in disulfidoptosis that exhibited differential expression within endothelial cells (ECs). Sequentially, the robustness and precision of the DRPS model were rigorously verified through both internal and external validation datasets. In parallel, we executed single-cell trajectory analysis to delve into the differentiation dynamics of ECs. Concluding our study, we undertook a comprehensive investigation encompassing various facets. These included comparative assessments of enrichment pathways, clinicopathological parameters, immune cell abundance, immune response-associated genes, impacts of immunotherapy, and drug predictions among distinct risk cohorts. RESULTS: The scrutiny of scRNA-seq data underscored discernible disparities in cellular composition between LUAD and normal samples. Furthermore, disulfidoptosis-associated genes exhibited marked discrepancies within endothelial cells (ECs). Consequently, we formulated the Disulfidoptosis-Related Prognostic Signature (DRPS) to facilitate prognostic prediction. The prognostic nomogram based on the risk score effectively demonstrated DRPS's robust capacity to prognosticate survival outcomes. This assertion was corroborated by rigorous assessments utilizing both internal and external validation sets, thus affirming the commendable predictive accuracy and enduring stability of DRPS. Functional enrichment analysis shed light on the significant correlation of DRPS with pathways intrinsic to the cell cycle. Subsequent analysis unveiled correlations between DRPS and gene mutations characteristic of LUAD, as well as indications of an immunosuppressive status. Through drug prediction, we explored potential therapeutic agents for low-risk patients. Concluding our investigation, qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the heightened expression levels of EPHX1, LDHA, SHC1, MYO6, and TLE1 in lung cancer cell lines.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influences of aryl hydrocarbon (AHR), cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) genetic polymorphisms on small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. METHODS: This nested case-control study (126 cases and 381 controls) was based on a prospective cohort study in Shanxi Province, China. We collected the general information of subjects using questionnaire and identified their single nucleotide polymorphisms by the MassARRAY genotyping platform. RESULTS: The polymorphisms of CYP1A1 (rs4646421 and rs4646903) and EPHX1 (rs1051740) were significantly associated with SGA. Neonates of women with EPHX1 (rs1051740) and GSTP1 (rs1695) variant alleles were at a significantly increased risk of SGA compared with the reference group (OR  =  5.26; 95% CI, 1.08-25.66), as were neonates of women with CYP1A1 (rs4646903) and EPHX1 (rs1051740) variant alleles (OR  =  7.11; 95% CI, 1.55-32.62). The results of strata analysis by AHR (rs2282883 and rs17137566) showed that the associations between the polymorphisms of CYP1A1 (rs4646421 and rs4646903) EPHX1 (rs1051740), GSTP1 (rs1695) and SGA were of significance in women with variant heterozygous or homozygous genotype. CONCLUSIONS: CYP1A1 (rs4646421 and rs4646903), EPHX1 (rs1051740), and GSTP1 (rs1695) genetic variances might increase the risk of SGA. AHR (rs2282883 and rs17137566) resulted in estimated effects varying across strata on CYP1A1 (rs4646421 and rs4646903), EPHX1 (rs1051740), and GSTP1 (rs1695).
BACKGROUND: EPHX1 is a key enzyme in metabolizing some exogenous carcinogens such as products of cigarette-smoking. Two functional polymorphisms in the EPHX1 gene, Tyr113His and His139Arg can alter the enzyme activity, suggesting their possible association with carcinogenesis risk, particularly of some tobacco-related cancers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of available studies on these two polymorphisms and cancer risk published up to November 2010, consisting of 84 studies (31144 cases and 42439 controls) for Tyr113His and 77 studies (28496 cases and 38506 controls) for His139Arg primarily focused on lung cancer, upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancers (including oral, pharynx, larynx and esophagus cancers), colorectal cancer or adenoma, bladder cancer and breast cancer. Results showed that Y113H low activity allele (H) was significantly associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.80-0.96) and UADT cancers (OR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.77-0.97) and H139R high activity allele (R) with increased risk of lung cancer (OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.04-1.33) but not of UADT cancers (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.93-1.17). Pooled analysis of lung and UADT cancers revealed that low EPHX1 enzyme activity, predicted by the combination of Y113H and H139R showed decreased risk of these cancers (OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.75-0.93) whereas high EPHX1 activity increased risk of the cancers (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.98-1.46). Furthermore, modest difference for the risk of lung and UADT cancers was found between cigarette smokers and nonsmokers both in single SNP analyses (low activity allele H: OR = 0.77/0.85 for smokers/nonsmokers; high activity allele R: OR = 1.20/1.09 for smokers/nonsmokers) and in combined double SNP analyses (putative low activity: OR = 0.73/0.88 for smokers/nonsmokers; putative high activity: OR = 1.02/0.93 for smokers/ nonsmokers). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Putative low EPHX1 enzyme activity may have a potential protective effect on tobacco-related carcinogenesis of lung and UADT cancers, whereas putative high EPHX1 activity may have a harmful effect. Moreover, cigarette-smoking status may influence the association of EPHX1 enzyme activity and the related cancer risk.
