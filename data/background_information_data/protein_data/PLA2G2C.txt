BACKGROUND: Fish oil-derived long-chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), reduce plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. Genetic factors such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in genes involved in metabolic pathways of n-3 PUFA could be responsible for well-recognized heterogeneity in plasma TG response to n-3 PUFA supplementation. Previous studies have shown that genes in the glycerophospholipid metabolism such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2) group II, IV, and VI, demonstrate changes in their expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after n-3 PUFA supplementation. METHODS: A total of 208 subjects consumed 3 g/day of n-3 PUFA for 6 weeks. Plasma lipids were measured before and after the supplementation period. Five SNPs in PLA2G2A, six in PLA2G2C, eight in PLA2G2D, six in PLA2G2F, 22 in PLA2G4A, five in PLA2G6, and nine in PLA2G7 were genotyped. The MIXED Procedure for repeated measures adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and energy intake was used in order to test whether the genotype, supplementation or interaction (genotype by supplementation) were associated with plasma TG levels. RESULTS: The n-3 PUFA supplementation had an independent effect on plasma TG levels. Genotype effects on plasma TG levels were observed for rs2301475 in PLA2G2C, rs818571 in PLA2G2F, and rs1569480 in PLA2G4A. Genotype x supplementation interaction effects on plasma TG levels were observed for rs1805018 in PLA2G7 as well as for rs10752979, rs10737277, rs7540602, and rs3820185 in PLA2G4A. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, SNPs in PLA2 genes may influence plasma TG levels during a supplementation with n-3 PUFA. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01343342.
BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic is one of the most common naturally occurring contaminants found in the environment. Arsenic is associated with a number of health outcomes, with epigenetic modification suggested as a potential mechanism of toxicity. OBJECTIVE: Among a sample of 400 adult participants, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, as measured by blood and urinary total arsenic concentrations, and epigenome-wide white blood cell DNA methylation. METHODS: We used linear regression models to examine the associations between arsenic exposure and methylation at each CpG site, adjusted for sex, age, and batch. Differentially methylated loci were subsequently examined in relation to corresponding gene expression for functional evidence of gene regulation. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, we observed four differentially methylated CpG sites with urinary total arsenic concentration and three differentially methylated CpG sites with blood arsenic concentration, based on the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of p < 1 x 10(-7). Methylation of PLA2G2C (probe cg04605617) was the most significantly associated locus in relation to both urinary (p = 3.40 x 10(-11)) and blood arsenic concentrations (p = 1.48 x 10(-11)). Three additional novel methylation loci-SQSTM1 (cg01225779), SLC4A4 (cg06121226), and IGH (cg13651690)--were also significantly associated with arsenic exposure. Further, there was evidence of methylation-related gene regulation based on gene expression for a subset of differentially methylated loci. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant associations between arsenic exposure and gene-specific differential white blood cell DNA methylation, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may be an important pathway underlying arsenic toxicity. The specific differentially methylated loci identified may inform potential pathways for future interventions.
BACKGROUND: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complicating factor in cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting 2-15% of patients. We hypothesized that sensitization/challenge of CFTR(-/-) mice with an Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) extract will affect eicosanoid pathway gene expression, impacting ABPA and CF. METHODS: FABP-hCFTR(+/-)-CFTR(-/-) mice were sensitized/challenged with an Af extract and gene expression of lung mRNA was evaluated for >40 genes, with correlative data in human CF (IB3.1) and CFTR-corrected (S9) bronchoepithelial cell lines. RESULTS: Pla2g4c, Pla2g2c, Pla2g2d and Pla2g5 were induced in response to Af in CFTR(-/-) mice. Interestingly, PLA2G2D was induced by LPS, IL-2, IL-6, IL-13, and Af only in CFTR-deficient human IB3.1 cells. Prostanoid gene expression was relatively constant, however, several 12/15-lipoxygenase genes were induced in response to Af. Numerous cytokines also caused differential expression of ALOX15 only in IB3.1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct regulation of PLA2G4C, PLA2G2D and ALOX15 genes in Aspergillus sensitization and/or cystic fibrosis could provide new insights into diagnosis and treatment of ABPA and CF.
The Group IIA phospholipase gene (PLA2G2A) protein coding regions exhibit significant homology with recently described Group IIC (PLA2G2C) and Group V (PLA2GV) genes. All three genes are present in many mammalian species and are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. Here, we demonstrate in human that they are tightly linked and map to chromosome 1p34-p36.1. We also show that the homologous mouse loci are tightly linked (no observed recombination) on the distal part of chromosome 4, a region exhibiting synteny with human 1p34-p36. Unlike its rodent counterpart, human PLA2G2C appears to be a nonfunctional pseudogene.
BACKGROUND: Tobacco and alcohol are recognized risk factors for heart disease, yet their causal effects on electrocardiogram (ECG) signaling and mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies may be susceptible to confounding or bias, and this study dissected the genetic architecture linking tobacco and alcohol consumption with P-wave duration, PR interval, and QT interval. METHODS: Utilizing genetic instruments for tobacco and alcohol consumption, associated methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL), and summary-level GWAS data for ECG indices, we assessed heritability and genetic causal associations using linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Fine mapping was performed via colocalization analysis and summary-data-based MR (SMR) to identify potential shared genetic variants. RESULTS: A positive causal relationship was found between drinks per week (DrnkWk) and QT interval [beta (95%CI): 1.06 (0.91, 5.05), P = 0.005], with causality substantiated through multiple robust MR models. Multivariable MR confirmed independence from smoking phenotypes. In epigenetic MR analyses, two alcohol-related CpG loci (cg03345232 and cg04605617) were causally associated with QT interval changes, with cg04605617 mapping to PLA2G2C gene significantly prolonging QT. The mQTL rs10916683 at cg04605617 is a strong eQTL for PLA2G2C. Additionally, cg03345232 shared a causal variant (rs12881206) with QT interval predisposition through colocalization analysis. SMR analysis did not identify shared putative functional genes passing the HEIDI test between DrnkWk and the QT interval. CONCLUSIONS: There is a causal relationship between DrnkWk and QT interval prolongation, and targeting specific DNA methylation sites like cg04605617 mapped to PLA2G2C may provide novel targets for preventing QT interval prolongation.
Mutation of Pla2g2a, a secretory phospholipase A(2) gene, dramatically increases the number of intestinal polyps that develop in the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse, a murine model for adenomatous polyposis coli in humans. We tested the hypothesis that mutation of the human homologue(s) of this gene might be responsible for the more severe phenotype (hundreds of polyps) seen in a subset of individuals with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC). DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that alterations of PLA2G2A, as well as related genes PLA2G2C and PLA2G5, were evenly distributed between three classes of AAPC subjects: those with small, intermediate, and large numbers of adenomatous colonic polyps. Among 67 additional unrelated AAPC subjects, a stop mutation in PLA2G2C did not correlate with an increased burden of adenomatous polyps. Therefore, mutation of the human homologue(s) of murine Pla2g2a does not appear to be responsible for phenotypic variation among subjects with AAPC.
