The identification of key genes in transcriptomic data constitutes a huge challenge. Our review of microarray reports revealed 88 genes whose transcription is consistently regulated by glucocorticoids (GCs), such as cortisol, corticosterone and dexamethasone, in the brain. Replicable transcriptomic data were combined with biochemical and physiological data to create an integrated view of the effects induced by GCs. The most frequently reported genes were Errfi1 and Ddit4. Their up-regulation was associated with the altered transcription of genes regulating growth factor and mTORC1 signaling (Gab1, Tsc22d3, Dusp1, Ndrg2, Ppp5c and Sesn1) and progression of the cell cycle (Ccnd1, Cdkn1a and Cables1). The GC-induced reprogramming of cell function involves changes in the mRNA level of genes responsible for the regulation of transcription (Klf9, Bcl6, Klf15, Tle3, Cxxc5, Litaf, Tle4, Jun, Sox4, Sox2, Sox9, Irf1, Sall2, Nfkbia and Id1) and the selective degradation of mRNA (Tob2). Other genes are involved in the regulation of metabolism (Gpd1, Aldoc and Pdk4), actin cytoskeleton (Myh2, Nedd9, Mical2, Rhou, Arl4d, Osbpl3, Arhgef3, Sdc4, Rdx, Wipf3, Chst1 and Hepacam), autophagy (Eva1a and Plekhf1), vesicular transport (Rhob, Ehd3, Vps37b and Scamp2), gap junctions (Gjb6), immune response (Tiparp, Mertk, Lyve1 and Il6r), signaling mediated by thyroid hormones (Thra and Sult1a1), calcium (Calm2), adrenaline/noradrenaline (Adcy9 and Adra1d), neuropeptide Y (Npy1r) and histamine (Hdc). GCs also affected genes involved in the synthesis of polyamines (Azin1) and taurine (Cdo1). The actions of GCs are restrained by feedback mechanisms depending on the transcription of Sgk1, Fkbp5 and Nr3c1. A side effect induced by GCs is increased production of reactive oxygen species. Available data show that the brain's response to GCs is part of an emergency mode characterized by inactivation of non-core activities, restrained inflammation, restriction of investments (growth), improved efficiency of energy production and the removal of unnecessary or malfunctioning cellular components to conserve energy and maintain nutrient supply during the stress response.
The alpha1D-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1D) is a key regulator of cardiovascular, prostate, and central nervous system functions. This clinically relevant G protein-coupled receptor has proven difficult to study, as it must form an obligate modular homodimer containing the PDZ proteins scribble and syntrophin or become retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as non-functional protein. We previously determined that targeted removal of the N-terminal (NT) 79 amino acids facilitates ADRA1D plasma membrane expression and agonist-stimulated functional responses. However, whether such an event occurs in physiological contexts was unknown. Herein, we report the ADRA1D is subjected to innate NT processing in cultured human cells. SNAP near-infrared imaging and tandem-affinity purification revealed the ADRA1D is expressed as both full-length and NT truncated forms in multiple human cell lines. Serial truncation mapping identified the cleavage site as Leu(90)/Val(91) in the 95-amino acid ADRA1D NT domain, suggesting human cells express a Delta1-91 ADRA1D species. Tandem-affinity purification MS/MS and co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicate NT processing of ADRA1D is not required to form scribble-syntrophin macromolecular complexes. Yet, label-free dynamic mass redistribution signaling assays demonstrate that Delta1-91 ADRA1D agonist responses were greater than WT ADRA1D. Mutagenesis of the cleavage site nullified the processing event, resulting in ADRA1D agonist responses less than the WT receptor. Thus, we propose that processing of the ADRA1D NT domain is a physiological mechanism employed by cells to generate a functional ADRA1D isoform with optimal pharmacodynamic properties.
Cutaneous melanoma is a highly aggressive and malignant skin cancer, and its high recurrence rate and drug resistance increase the difficulty of treating advanced-stage patients. Studies have revealed that treatment via stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRA1) subtypes inhibits melanoma growth in mice. However, the associations between alpha-1D adrenergic receptor (ADRA1D) and cutaneous melanoma are poorly understood. Tissue specimens from 16 pairs of patients with a pigmented nevus and cutaneous melanoma were analyzed for ADRA1D expression using immunohistochemical staining. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were carried out in order to detect ADRA1D expression levels in melanoma cells and human epidermal melanocytes (HEMs), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in HUVECS. A375 cells were transfected with a lentivirus overexpressing ADRA1D. Wound-healing, Transwell, and cell proliferation assays were utilized to identify the ADRA1D effect on the migration, invasion, and proliferation of the two groups of A375 cells in vitro. In order to evaluate the function of ADRA1D in vivo, a melanoma xenograft model was developed in immunodeficient mice. ADRA1D was low expressed in cutaneous melanoma tissues. Overexpression of ADRA1D inhibited the tubulation and migration of HUVECs in vitro. Overexpression of ADRA1D significantly decreased the HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression. Overexpression of ADRA1D inhibited the invasion and proliferation of A375 melanoma cells in vitro and reduced its angiogenesis in vivo. ADRA1D inhibits cutaneous melanoma growth and angiogenesis. It attenuates melanoma cell proliferation and invasion. Meanwhile, its anti-angiogenic effect is achieved by negatively regulating the HIF-1alpha/VEGF axis in melanoma tissue, thereby attenuating the growth of cutaneous melanoma and reducing the potential of metastasis.
BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VaD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular factors, affecting a significant portion of the aging population and highlighting the critical need to understand specific targets and mechanisms for effective prevention and treatment strategies. We aimed to identify pathways and crucial genes involved in the progression of VaD through bioinformatics analysis and subsequently validate these findings. METHODS: We conducted differential expression analysis, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis. We utilized pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells to create an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model. We investigated the impact of overexpression and interference of adrenoceptor alpha 1D (ADRA1D) on OGD PC12 cells using TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot (WB), and Fluo-3-pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3 AM) analysis. RESULTS: We found 187 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the red module that were strongly associated with VaD and were primarily enriched in vasoconstriction, G protein-coupled amine receptor activity, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and cell adhesion. Among these pathways, we identified ADRA1D as a gene shared by vasoconstriction, G protein-coupled amine receptor activity, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. The TUNEL assay revealed a significant decrease in PC12 cell apoptosis with ADRA1D overexpression (p < 0.01) and a significant increase in apoptosis upon silencing ADRA1D (p < 0.01). RT-qPCR and WB analysis revealed elevated ADRA1D expression (p < 0.001) and decreased phospholipase C beta (PLCbeta) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) expression (p < 0.05) with ADRA1D overexpression. Moreover, the Fluo-3 AM assessment indicated significantly lower intracellular Ca2+ levels with ADRA1D overexpression (p < 0.001). Conversely, interference with ADRA1D yielded opposite results. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a new perspective on the pathogenic mechanisms of VaD and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. The results highlight the role of ADRA1D in modulating cellular responses to OGD and VaD, suggesting its potential as a target for VaD treatment.
Patulin (PAT) is a common mycotoxin contaminant of apple products linked to impaired metabolic and kidney function. Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), abundantly expressed in the kidney, intercedes metabolic changes and renal injury. The alpha-1-adrenergic receptors (alpha(1)-AR) facilitate Epinephrine (Epi)-mediated AMPK activation, linking metabolism and kidney function. Preliminary molecular docking experiments examined potential interactions and AMPK-gamma subunit 3 (PRKAG3). The effect of PAT exposure (0.2-2.5 microM; 24 h) on the AMPK pathway and alpha(1)-AR was then investigated in HEK293 human kidney cells. AMPK agonist Epi determined direct effects on the alpha(1)-AR, metformin was used as an activator for AMPK, while buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) assessed GSH inhibition and supplementation respectively. ADRA1A and ADRA1D expression was determined by qPCR. alpha(1)-AR, ERK1/2/MAPK and PI3K/Akt protein expression was assessed using western blotting. PAT (1 microM) decreased alpha(1)-AR protein and mRNA and altered downstream signalling. This was consistent in cells stimulated with Epi and metformin. BSO potentiated the observed effect on alpha(1)-AR while NAC ameliorated these effects. Molecular docking studies performed on Human ADRA1A and PRKAG3 indicated direct interactions with PAT. This study is the first to show PAT modulates the AMPK pathway and alpha(1)-AR, supporting a mechanism of kidney injury.
INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia and is rapidly emerging as one of the costliest and most burdensome diseases. Neurotransmitter receptors play a vital role in many neuronal processes, primarily regulating signal inhibition within the brain to facilitate cell communication. OBJECTIVES: Our research aims to identify potential biomarkers associated with AD and how these biomarkers impact immune infiltration. METHODS: We extracted mRNA expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were employed to identify hub genes as biomarkers in AD. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were used for functional enrichment. Furthermore, we examined 22 immune cell types infiltration using "CIBERSORT". RESULTS: In this study, we identified 70 neurotransmitter receptor genes showing differential expression in AD: 22 were up-regulated, and 48 were down-regulated. Functional analyses indicated these genes were involved in essential biochemical pathways, including G protein-coupled receptors, neurotransmitter receptor activity, and ion channel interactions. WGCNA generated three co-expression modules, with one demonstrating the strongest association with AD. Five key NRGs (HTR3C, HTR3E, ADRA2A, HTR3A, and ADRA1D) were identified using a combination of differential genes. These genes have better diagnostic value by ROC analysis. Immune infiltration analysis showed that these genes were closely associated with the levels of resting mast cells, activated natural killer (NK) cells, and plasma cells in AD compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Our study identified five NRGs (ADRA1D, ADRA2A, HTR3A, HTR3C, and HTR3E) with significant associations with AD. These findings may offer promising sights for further studies.
We have developed a novel reporter assay that leverages SNAP-epitope tag/near-infrared (NIR) imaging technology to monitor G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) degradation in human cell lines. N-terminal SNAP-tagged GPCRs were subcloned and expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and then subjected to 24 h of cycloheximide (CHX)-chase degradation assays to quantify receptor degradation half-lives (t(1/2)) using LICOR NIR imaging-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. Thus far, we have used this method to quantify t(1/2) for all nine adrenergic (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3), five somatostatin (SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR4, SSTR5), four chemokine (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR5), and three 5-HT2 (5HT2A, 5HT2B, 5HT2C) receptor subtypes. SNAP-GPCR-CHX degradation t(1/2) values ranged from 0.52 h (ADRA1D) to 5.5 h (SSTR3). On the contrary, both the SNAP-tag alone and SNAP-tagged and endogenous beta-actin were resistant to degradation with CHX treatment. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib produced significant but variable increases in SNAP-GPCR protein expression levels, indicating that SNAP-GPCR degradation primarily occurs through the proteasome. Remarkably, endogenous beta2-adrenergic receptor/ADRB2 dynamic mass redistribution functional responses to norepinephrine were significantly decreased following CHX treatment, with a time course equivalent to that observed with the SNAP-ADRB2 degradation assay. We subsequently adapted this assay into a 96-well glass-bottom plate format to facilitate high-throughput GPCR degradation screening. t(1/2) values quantified for the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes (ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADR1D) using the 96-well-plate format correlated with t(1/2) values quantified using NIR-PAGE imaging analysis. In summary, this novel assay permits precise quantitative analysis of GPCR degradation in human cells and can be readily adapted to quantify degradation for any membrane protein of interest.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). The standard of care improves the overall survival of patients only by a few months. Explorations of new therapeutic targets related to molecular properties of the tumor are under way. Even though neurotransmitters and their receptors normally function as mediators of interneuronal communication, growing data suggest that these molecules are also involved in modulating the development and growth of GBM by acting on neuronal and glioblastoma stem cells. In our previous DNA CpG methylation studies, gene ontology analyses revealed the involvement of the monoamine pathway in sequential GBM. In this follow-up study, we quantitated the expression levels of four selected catecholamine pathway markers (alpha 1D adrenergic receptor-ADRA1D; adrenergic beta receptor kinase 1 or G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2-ADRBK1/GRK2; dopamine receptor D2-DRD2; and synaptic vesicle monoamine transporter-SLC18A2) by immunohistochemistry, and compared the histological scores with the methylation levels within the promoters + genes of these markers in 21 pairs of sequential GBM and in controls. Subsequently, we also determined the promoter and gene methylation levels of the same markers in an independent database cohort of sequential GBM pairs. These analyses revealed partial inverse correlations between the catecholamine protein expression and promoter + gene methylation levels, when the tumor and control samples were compared. However, we found no differences in the promoter + gene methylation levels of these markers in either our own or in the database primary-recurrent GBM pairs, despite the higher protein expression of all markers in the primary samples. This observation suggests that regulation of catecholamine expression is only partially related to CpG methylation within the promoter + gene regions, and additional mechanisms may also influence the expression of these markers in progressive GBM. These analyses underscore the involvement of certain catecholamine pathway markers in GBM development and suggest that these molecules mediating or modulating tumor growth merit further exploration.
Both methylation and brain volume patterns hold important biological information for the development and prognosis of schizophrenia (SZ). A combined study to probe the association between them provides a new perspective to understanding SZ. Genomic methylation of peripheral blood and regional brain volumes derived from magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed using parallel independent component analyses in this study. Nine methylation components and five brain volumetric components were extracted for 94 SZ patients and 106 healthy controls. After controlling for age, sex, race, and substance use, a component comprised primarily of bilateral cerebellar volumes was significantly correlated to a methylation component from 14 CpG sites in 13 genes. Both patients and healthy controls demonstrated similar associations, but patients had significantly smaller cerebellar volumes and dysmethylation in the associated epigenetic component compared to controls. The 13 genes are enriched in cellular growth and proliferation with some genes involved in neuronal growth and cerebellum development (GATA4, ADRA1D, EPHA3, and KCNK10), and these genes are prominently associated with neurological and psychological disorders. Such findings suggest that the methylation pattern of the genes coding for cellular growth may influence the cerebellar development through regulating gene expression, and the alteration in the methylation of these genes in SZ patients may contribute to the cerebellar volume reduction observed in patients.
Coronary microvascular dysfunction predicts and may be a proximate cause of cardiac dysfunction and mortality in diabetes; however, few effective treatments exist for these conditions. We recently demonstrated that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism reversed cardiovascular dysfunction in early-stage obesity/insulin resistance. The mechanisms underlying this benefit of MR antagonism and its relevance in the setting of long-term obesity complications like diabetes; however, remain unclear. Thus, the present study evaluated the impact of MR antagonism on diabetes-related coronary dysfunction and defines the MR-dependent vascular transcriptome in the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat recapitulating later stages of human diabetes. OLETF rats were treated with spironolactone (Sp) and compared to untreated OLETF and lean Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats. Sp treatment attenuated diabetes-associated adipose and cardiac inflammation/fibrosis and improved coronary endothelium-dependent vasodilation but did not alter enhanced coronary vasoconstriction, blood pressure, or metabolic parameters in OLETF rats. Further mechanistic studies using RNA deep sequencing of OLETF rat aortas revealed 157 differentially expressed genes following Sp including upregulation of genes involved in the molecular regulation of nitric oxide bioavailability (Hsp90ab1, Ahsa1, Ahsa2) as well as novel changes in alpha(1D) adrenergic receptors (Adra1d), cyclooxygenase-2 (Ptgs2), and modulatory factors of these pathways (Ackr3, Acsl4). Further, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted inhibition of upstream inflammatory regulators by Sp and inhibition of 'migration of endothelial cells', 'differentiation of smooth muscle', and 'angiogenesis' biological functions by Sp in diabetes. Thus, this study is the first to define the MR-dependent vascular transcriptome underlying treatment of diabetes-related coronary microvascular dysfunction by Sp.
BACKGROUND: Dementia, mainly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), remains a global health challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of acupuncture therapy (AT) in improving dementia. Nevertheless, the therapeutic targets and integrated biological mechanisms involved remain ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: To identify therapeutic targets and biological mechanisms of AT in treating dementia by integrated analysis strategy. METHODS: By the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of AD, VaD, and molecular targets of AT active components, the acupuncture therapeutic targets associated with the biological response to AD and VaD were extracted. Therapeutic targets-based functional enrichment analysis was conducted, and multiple networks were constructed. AT-therapeutic crucial targets were captured by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The interactions between crucial targets with AT active components were verified by molecular docking. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that 132 and 76 acupuncture therapeutic targets were associated with AD and VaD. AT-therapeutic crucial targets including 58 for AD and 24 for VaD were captured by WGCNA, with 11 in shared, including NMU, GRP, TAC1, ADRA1D, and SST. In addition, 35 and 14 signaling pathways were significantly enriched by functional enrichment analysis, with 6 mutual pathways including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, GABAergic synapse, calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, and inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels. CONCLUSION: The improvement of AD and VaD by AT was associated with modulation of synaptic function, immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis. Our study clarified the therapeutic targets of AT on dementia, providing valuable clues for complementing and combining pharmacotherapy.
One of the sensitive markers for autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) clinical identification is thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs). To quickly distinguish TRAb with distinct antigenic epitopes, a straightforward and uncomplicated technique has not yet been created. The objective of this study is to search for molecular diagnostic targets for different types of AITD Graves' disease (GD), Graves' orbitopathy (GO), GD with third-degree goiter [GD(3)], hypothyroidism combined with positive TRAb [HT(TRAb+)] as molecular diagnostic targets. Following action on thyroid cells, differential genes (DEGs) generated by TRAb with distinct antigenic epitopes were detected and identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), bioinformatics analysis, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in the serum of patients with AITD. Using the 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, the effect of coculturing thyroid cells with different antigenic TRAb epitopes on the cells' capacity to proliferate was investigated. Bioinformatics analysis and RT-qPCR validation identified one GD key gene alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG), two GO key genes [adrenoceptor alpha 1D (ADRA1D) and H2B clustered histone 18 (H2BC18)], two GD(3) key genes [suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and cytochrome b-245 beta (CYBB)], and one HT(TRAb+) key gene (MASP2). Correlation analysis and ROC curves showed that the abovementioned genes could be used as molecular diagnostic targets for different types of AITD. Finally, EdU results showed that TRAb inhibited thyroid cell proliferation in the HT(TRAb+) group compared with the normal control group, whereas the remaining three groups promoted thyroid cell proliferation, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). We identified six key genes for different types of AITD, which have diagnostic value for different types of AITD. Meanwhile, we found that TRAbs with different antigenic epitopes in AITD have different biological functions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We identified six molecular targets of different types of AITD [GD, GO, GD(3), and HT(TRAb+)], which have diagnostic value for different types of AITD. Meanwhile, we found that TRAb with different antigenic epitopes extracted from the sera of patients with AITD had different biological functions, which also provided a new idea for further research on the mechanism of action of TRAb with different antigenic epitopes in AITD.
Recent clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that the administration with beta-blockers decreases the mortality in the patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). However, significant heterogeneity exists in the effectiveness of beta-blockers among individual cases. We focused on 39 polymorphisms in 16 genes related to adrenergic system and investigated their association with the response to beta-blockers among 80 patients with CHF owing to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The polymorphisms of NET T-182C (P=0.019), ADRA1D T1848A (P=0.023) and ADRA1D A1905G (P=0.029) were associated with the improvement of left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) by beta-blockers. Furthermore, combined genotype analysis of NET T-182C and ADRA1D T1848A revealed a significant difference in LVFS improvement among genotype groups (P=0.011). These results suggest that NET (T-182C) and ADRA1D (T1848A and A1905G) polymorphisms are predictive markers of the response to beta-blockers. Genotyping of these polymorphisms may provide clinical insights into an individual difference in the response to the beta-blocker therapy in CHF.
Preoperative lymph node (LN) status is important for the treatment of bladder cancer (BCa). Here, we report a genomic-clinicopathologic nomogram for preoperatively predicting LN metastasis in BCa. In the discovery stage, 325 BCa patients from TCGA were involved and LN-status-related mRNAs were selected. In the training stage, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to developed a genomic-clinicopathologic nomogram for preoperative LN metastasis prediction in the training set (SYSMH set, n=178). In the validation stage, we validated the nomogram using two independent sample sets (SYSUCC set, n=142; RJH set, n=104) with respect to its discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. As results, we identified five LN-status-related mRNAs, including ADRA1D, COL10A1, DKK2, HIST2H3D and MMP11. Then, a genomic classifier was developed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups in the training set. Furthermore, a nomogram incorporating the five-mRNA-based classifier, image-based LN status, transurethral resection (TUR) T stage, and TUR lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was constructed in the training set, which performed well in the training and validation sets. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical value of our nomogram. Thus, our genomic-clinicopathologic nomogram shows favorable discriminatory ability and may aid in clinical decision-making, especially for cN-patients.
alpha(1)-Adrenoceptors seem to play key roles in cardiovascular, genitourinary, and central nervous system functions. This review will be focused on alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors. These receptors have intrinsic activity, and many of the more commonly used antagonists are in reality inverse agonists. alpha(1D)-Adrenoceptors are phosphorylated in the basal state, and the natural agonists, adrenaline and noradrenaline, increase their phosphorylation; similar effects are induced by direct activation of protein kinase C and through activation of nonadrenergic receptors. Interestingly, a large proportion of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors are located in intracellular vesicles. Such intracellular location can be changed to surface expression through the use of inverse agonists and coexpression of alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors, which seem to act as pharmacological chaperons for proper plasma membrane insertion. The alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor amino terminus seems to contain a signal that keeps the receptor intracellularly, but interaction with other proteins may also contribute. The precise relationship between the intrinsic activity, phosphorylation, and intracellular location is currently unknown. alpha(1D)-Adrenoceptor activation induces contraction in a variety of vessels, and a role in the control of blood pressure has been suggested. Studies using young prehypertensive and adult spontaneously hypertensive rats as well as knockout mice suggest that vascular alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors are involved in the genesis/maintenance of hypertension.
PURPOSE: Interstitial cystitis is a chronic and sterile inflammatory disease of the bladder. Clinically many patients with interstitial cystitis also have allergic or autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have suggested that allelic variations in the adrenergic receptor beta2 gene, the interleukin (IL)-4 gene and its receptor gene are closely associated with immune diseases. Therefore, we studied adrenergic receptor genes alpha1d (ADRA1d), beta2 (ADRB2) and beta3 (ADRB3), and IL-4/IL-4 receptor genes in patients with interstitial cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 55 patients with interstitial cystitis and 228 controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from a whole blood sample collected from each subject. We analyzed 5 gene polymorphisms (G404781T, Arg16Gly, Trp64Arg, C589T and Ile50Val) per gene (ADRA1d, ADRB2, ADRB3, IL-4 and IL-4 receptor, respectively) and their relationship to interstitial cystitis. RESULTS: The frequency of the Arg/Arg genotype of the ADRB2 gene and the TT genotype of the IL-4 gene were significantly higher in patients with interstitial cystitis than in controls. A significant difference of ADRA1d genotype prevalence was also observed. However, there were no remarkable differences of IL-4 receptor or ADRB3 genotype prevalences. CONCLUSIONS: Variants of the ADRB2, ADRA1d and IL-4 genes may be related to a predisposition to interstitial cystitis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is increasingly associated with nerve-driven processes and endogenous innate immune ligands such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Interestingly, a connection between these entities has not been explored. Here, we report that noradrenaline (NA) derived from the lung's adrenergic nerve supply drives alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA)-expressing fibroblast accumulation via mechanisms involving alpha1 adrenoreceptors and mtDNA. Using the bleomycin model, we compared ablation of the lung's adrenergic nerve supply with surgical adrenal resection and found that NA derived from local but not adrenal sources contributes to experimentally induced lung fibrosis and the emergence of an alphaSMA+ve fibroblast population expressing adrenoreceptor alpha-1D (ADRA1D). Therapeutic delivery of the alpha1 adrenoreceptor antagonist terazosin reversed these changes and suppressed extracellular mtDNA accumulation. Cultured normal human lung fibroblasts displayed alpha1 adrenoreceptors and in response to costimulation with TGFbeta1 and NA adopted ACTA2 expression and extracellular mtDNA release. These findings were opposed by terazosin. Evaluation of a previously studied IPF cohort revealed that patients prescribed alpha1 adrenoreceptor antagonists for nonpulmonary indications demonstrated improved survival and reduced concentrations of plasma mtDNA. Our observations link nerve-derived NA, alpha1 adrenoreceptors, extracellular mtDNA, and lung fibrogenesis in mouse models, cultured cells, and humans with IPF. Further study of this neuroinnate connection may yield new avenues for investigation in the clinical and basic science realms.
BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that hypertension and epilepsy have a high co-occurrence, and antihypertensive medications may have impacts on the prevention and treatment of epilepsy. However, the directionality of causation between them is elusive. METHOD: By leveraging genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data of each trait, we firstly performed bidirectional univariate Mendelian randomization (UVMR) to assess the strength and direction of the associations between pairs of traits, then multivariate MR (MVMR) was conducted to adjust for potential confounders in causalities. Cochran's Q statistics, leave-one-out analysis, MR-Egger regression and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier methods (MR-PRESSO) were employed to evaluate the robustness of the results. Drug target MR was proceeded to assess the association between five classes of first-line antihypertensive medications and epilepsy. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) extracted from GWAS data on systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP), along with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were utilized as proxies for antihypertensive medications, respectively. RESULTS: Forward UVMR results provided evidence that genetically predicted blood pressure traits and hypertension have causal effects on epilepsy, while reverse UVMR indicated no causal impacts of epilepsy on blood pressure traits or hypertension. The sensitivity analysis results were robust. The causalities between DBP, hypertension and epilepsy remained remarkable after adjustment by MVMR. Inverse-variance-weighted MR (IVW-MR) yielded evidence of positive association only between Beta-Blockers target genes based on DBP GWAS screening and epilepsy. Summary-data-based MR (SMR) identified a positive correlation between Beta-Blockers target gene ADRA1D and epilepsy risk. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension has a causal effect on epilepsy and managing DBP in patients with hypertension through Beta-Blockers may help prevent epilepsy.
Lymphoma is one of the leading causes of cancer and cancer deaths and yet has not been amenable to population screening. The role of methylated DNA markers (MDMs) in the detection of lymphoma has not been extensively studied. We aimed to discover, validate, and test tissue-derived MDMs of lymphoma in archival plasma specimens. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on a discovery set of frozen tissues. MDMs identified were converted to methylation-specific PCR assays and validated on independent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Target enrichment long-probe quantitative-amplified signal (TELQAS) assays were developed and assayed in plasma-extracted, bisulfite-converted DNA from independent treatment-naive lymphoma patients and healthy controls. Prediction of cancer status was modeled using random forest model with in silico cross-validation. After discovery and validation in tissue, 16 TELQAS assays (ZNF503, VWA5B1, HOXA9, GABRG3, ITGA5, MAX.chr17.7190, BNC1, CDK20, MAX.chr4.4069, TPBG, DNAH14, SYT6, CACNG8, FAM110B, ADRA1D, and NRN1) were selected for testing in plasma. These detected 78% (95% CI, 74%-82%) of lymphoma cases at 90% specificity. Excluding marginal zone and T-cell lymphomas, sensitivity increased to 84% (80%-88%). MDMs in plasma show promise to detect lymphoma and are candidates for inclusion in multi-cancer detection studies.
Currently utilized antidepressants have limited effectiveness and frequently incur undesired effects. Most antidepressants are thought to act via the inhibition of monoamine reuptake; however, direct binding to monoaminergic receptors has been proposed to contribute to both their clinical effectiveness and their side effects, or lack thereof. Among the target receptors of antidepressants, alpha1‑adrenergic receptors (ARs) have been implicated in depression etiology, antidepressant action, and side effects. However, differences in the direct effects of antidepressants on signaling from the three subtypes of alpha1-ARs, namely, alpha1A-, alpha1B- and alpha1D‑ARs, have been little explored. We utilized cell lines overexpressing alpha1A-, alpha1B- or alpha1D-ARs to investigate the effects of the antidepressants imipramine (IMI), desipramine (DMI), mianserin (MIA), reboxetine (REB), citalopram (CIT) and fluoxetine (FLU) on noradrenaline-induced second messenger generation by those receptors. We found similar orders of inhibition at alpha1A-AR (IMI < DMI < CIT < MIA < REB) and alpha1D‑AR (IMI = DMI < CIT < MIA), while the alpha1B-AR subtype was the least engaged subtype and was inhibited with low potency by three drugs (MIA < IMI = DMI). In contrast to their direct antagonistic effects, prolonged incubation with IMI and DMI increased the maximal response of the alpha1B-AR subtype, and the CIT of both the alpha1A- and the alpha1B-ARs. Our data demonstrate a complex, subtype-specific modulation of alpha1-ARs by antidepressants of different groups.
