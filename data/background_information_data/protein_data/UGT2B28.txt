BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring germline gene deletions (KO) represent a unique setting to interrogate gene functions. Complete deletions and differential expression of the human glycosyltransferase UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 genes are linked to prostate cancer (PCa) risk and progression, leukaemia, autoimmune and other diseases. METHODS: The systemic metabolic consequences of UGT deficiencies were examined using untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling of carefully matched, treatment-naive PCa cases. RESULTS: Each UGT KO differentially affected over 5% of the 1545 measured metabolites, with divergent metabolic perturbations influencing the same pathways. Several of the perturbed metabolites are known to promote PCa growth, invasion and metastasis, including steroids, ceramides and kynurenine. In UGT2B17 KO, reduced levels of inactive steroid-glucuronides were compensated by sulfated derivatives that constitute circulating steroid reservoirs. UGT2B28 KO presented remarkably lower levels of oxylipins paralleled by reduced inflammatory mediators, but higher ceramides unveiled as substrates of the enzyme in PCa cells. CONCLUSION: The distinctive and broad metabolic rewiring caused by UGT KO reinforces the need to examine their unique and divergent functions in PCa biology.
Androgens play a central role in prostate cancer progression. Systemic and local androgen bioavailability is controlled by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases conjugating enzymes (UGT), namely UGT2B15, UGT2B17 and UGT2B28. Reporter vector assays in HEK293 cells initially validated in silico-predicted regulatory potential of candidate miRNAs to target UGT transcripts, including miR-376c, miR-409 and miR-494 for UGT2B17, miR-331-5p and miR-376c for UGT2B15 while none were efficient for UGT2B28. miR-376c was shown as the most effective to downregulate UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 through interactions with a site conserved in both UGTs. Ectopic miR-376c expression in prostate cancer cells significantly reduced UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression (>32%; P<0.005) with a consequent decrease in dihydrotestosterone glucuronidation (-37%; P<0.001). Consistent with reduced androgen inactivation, ectopic expression of miR-376c changed expression of androgen responsive genes and enhanced cell proliferation with no effect on androgen receptor levels. Sustaining a role of miR-376c in the regulation of androgen-inactivating UGTs, its expression was significantly downregulated in prostatic tumors and further reduced in metastases (P<0.0001), whereas the opposite was observed for UGT2B15/17 (P=0.031). In high-grade tumors (Gleason >/=8), UGT2B15/17 and miR-376c were inversely correlated (r=-0.557; P=0.048) with also a significant relationship in metastases (r=-0.747; P=0.003). In line with a modification in androgen bioavailability, PSA mRNA levels were also negatively correlated to those of UGT2B15/17 (r=-0.573; P=0.01) but positively linked to levels of miR-376c (r=0.577; P=0.039). This study reveals that the androgen-inactivating UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 genes are direct targets of miR-376c and thus may influence steroid metabolism during prostate cancer progression.
BACKGROUND: Uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 2B (UGT2B) genes code for enzymes that catalyze the clearance of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and DHT metabolites in the prostate basal and luminal tissue. The expression of the UGT2B15, UGT2B17, and UGT2B28 enzymes has not been evaluated in prostate tissue samples from hormone therapy-naive patients. METHODS: We determined the expression of UGT2B15, UGT2B17, and UGT2B28 enzymes in 190 prostate tissue samples from surgical specimens of a multiethnic cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The association between each protein's percent positive and H-score, a weighted score of staining intensity, and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was tested using separate Cox proportional hazards models. In an exploratory analysis, UGT2B17 total positive and H-score were divided at the median and we tested the association between UGT2B17 group and risk of BCR. RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 118 months (IQR: 85-144). Of 190, 83 (44%) patients developed BCR. We found no association between UGT2B15 or UGT2B28 and risk of BCR. However, there was a trend for an association between UGT2B17 and BCR (HR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.11), though not statistically significant. Upon further investigation, we found that patients with UGT2B17 higher levels of expression had a significant increased risk of BCR on univariable analysis (HR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-2.43, p = 0.041), although this association was attenuated in the multivariable model (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 0.94-2.40, p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that UGT2B17 overexpression may be associated with a significant increased risk of BCR. These results are consistent with previous reports which showed UGT2B17 significantly expressed in advanced prostate cancer including prostate tumor metastases.
The androgen inactivating UGT2B28 pathway emerges as a predictor of progression in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the clinical significance of UGT2B28 tumoral expression and its contribution to PCa progression remain unclear. Using the Canadian Prostate Cancer Biomarker Network biobank (CPCBN; n = 1512), we analyzed UGT2B28 tumor expression in relation to clinical outcomes in men with localized PCa. UGT2B28 was overexpressed in tumors compared to paired normal adjacent prostatic tissue and was associated with inferior outcomes. Functional analyses indicated that UGT2B28 promoted cell proliferation, and its expression was regulated by the androgen receptor (AR)/ARv7. Mechanistically, UGT2B28 was shown to be a protein partner of the endocytic adaptor protein huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1), increasing its stability and priming AR/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, leading to ERK1/2 activation triggering cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). HIP1 knockdown in UGT2B28 positive cells, and dual pharmacological targeting of AR and EGFR pathways, abolished cell proliferative advantages conferred by UGT2B28. In conclusion, UGT2B28 is a prognosticator of progression in localized PCa, regulates both AR and EGFR oncogenic signaling pathways via HIP1, and therefore can be therapeutically targeted by using combination of existing AR/EGFR inhibitors.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most diagnosed cancer in the United States and is associated with metabolic reprogramming and significant disparities in clinical outcomes among African American (AA) men. While the cause is likely multi-factorial, the precise reasons for this are unknown. Here, we identified a higher expression of the metabolic enzyme UGT2B28 in localized PCa and metastatic disease compared to benign adjacent tissue, in AA PCa compared to benign adjacent tissue, and in AA PCa compared to European American (EA) PCa. UGT2B28 was found to be regulated by both full-length androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variant, AR-v7. Genetic knockdown of UGT2B28 across multiple PCa cell lines (LNCaP, LAPC-4, and VCaP), both in androgen-replete and androgen-depleted states resulted in impaired 3D organoid formation and a significant delay in tumor take and growth rate of xenograft tumors, all of which were rescued by re-expression of UGT2B28. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a key role for the UGT2B28 gene in promoting prostate tumor growth.
Glucuronidation is a major pathway for elimination of exogenous and endogenous compounds such as environmental carcinogens and androgens from the body. This biochemical pathway is mediated by enzymes called uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Null (del/del) genes polymorphisms in UGT2B17, and UGT2B28 and D85Y single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of UGT2B15 have been reported to increase the risk of prostate cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the association of mentioned genetic variants with the risk of prostate cancer. We investigated the copy number variations (CNVs) of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 loci and the association between rs1902023 polymorphism of UGT2B15 gene in 360 subjects consisted of 120 healthy controls, 120 prostate cancer (PC) patients and 120 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients. No association was detected for the mentioned polymorphisms and the risk of PC. However, a significant association was detected between UGT2B17 copy number variation and BPH risk (OR=2.189; 95% CI, 1.303-3.675; p=0.003). Furthermore, we observed that the D85Y polymorphism increases the risk of BPH when analyzed in combination with the copy number variation of UGT2B17 gene (OR=0.135; 95% CI, 0.036-0.512; p=0.003). Our findings suggest that the D85Y polymorphism of UGT2B15 and CNVs in UGT2B28 and UGT2B17 genes is not associated with prostate cancer risk in Iranian patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report that implicates the role of CNV of UGT2B17 gene in BPH.
We recently established a method for quantitative determination of human catalytically active UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) other than UGT2A1 and UGT2B28 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and applied the method to an exhaustive analysis of localization in various human tissues. We report here an additional quantitative determination method targeting UGT2B28. To date, there have been no reports on the distribution of UGT2B28 mRNA expression in human tissues based on quantitative determination. Human UGT2B28 was clearly detected in the breast and adipose tissue. UGT2B28 expression in the breast was comparatively low, about 1.6% of GAPDH mRNA levels, and was less than 5% of normalized (against GAPDH) UGT2B7 and 2B10 mRNA expression levels in the liver. Although the UGT2B28 has 97% identity with UGT2B11 at the cDNA sequence level, the primers constructed for UGT2B28 did not detect UGT2B11. In addition, significant expression of UGT2B11 was detected in the liver, breast and kidney, and was clearly different from the distribution of UGT2B28. Therefore, we conclude that the real-time RT-PCR method established here is very specific for human UGT2B28 isozyme.
BACKGROUND: Androgen inactivation occurs mainly through the glucuronidation conjugative reaction mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). This metabolic process is involved in the control of systemic and local androgen bioavailability. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship among expression of the androgen-inactivating UGT2B28 enzyme, circulating steroid hormone levels, and clinical phenotype in prostate cancer (PCa). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an analysis of a high-density prostate tumor tissue microarray consisting of 239 localized PCa cases. The study of 51 additional PCa patients with no copies of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2B subfamily, polypeptide B28 (UGT2B28) in their genomes was performed to confirm the importance of the enzyme on circulating hormone levels. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Steroid hormones were measured by mass spectrometry. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the influence of UGT2B28 on progression, and general linear model regression evaluated variations in hormone levels. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Tumor overexpression of UGT2B28 was associated with lower prostate-specific antigen levels at diagnosis, higher Gleason scores, margin and nodal invasion status, and it was shown to be an independent prognostic factor associated with progression. Enzyme overexpression correlated with 30% higher circulating levels of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Patients with no copies of UGT2B28 in their genomes have lower levels of T (19%), DHT (17%), its glucuronide metabolites (18-38%), and enhanced levels of the adrenal precursor androstenedione (36%). CONCLUSIONS: The UGT2B28 steroid-inactivating pathway modifies circulating T and DHT levels, and UGT2B28 overexpression is associated with high-grade PCa. Our work has uncovered the role of UGT2B28 as a regulator of steroidogenesis and underscores the interconnectivity among the steroid-inactivation capacity of cancer cells, hormone levels, disease characteristics, and the risk of cancer progression. PATIENT SUMMARY: The androgen-inactivating UGT2B28 enzyme influences hormone levels, clinical and pathologic factors, and the risk of cancer progression.
Sjogren's syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune disease, typically causes or involves inflammation in the salivary and lacrimal glands. Although recent genetic association studies have contributed to the discovery of SS susceptible genes, few studies have reported on the Korean population. Here, we did a genetic association study of SS in Korean patients using whole-exome sequencing data of 15 patients and 100 healthy controls. In addition to confirming previously described SS susceptibility loci MSH5 (p = 1.67 x 10-5) and RELN (p = 4.91 x 10-6), we also validated PRAMEF13 (p = 2.28 x 10-5), TARBP1 (p = 1.87 x 10-5), UGT2B28 (p = 1.33 x 10-5), TRBV5-6 (p = 2.27 x 10-5) and NAPB (p = 3.73 x 10-5) as novel susceptibility loci for SS. Furthermore, we identified UGT2B28, TARBP1 and PRAMEF13 as associated with human immune function. These findings may provide useful insight into to the pathways and pathogenesis contributing to SS susceptibility in the Korean population.
UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 are among the most commonly deleted genes in humans and encode members of the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 2B (UGT2B) subfamily. They are involved, along with UGT2B15, in the catabolism of sex-steroid hormones. Despite the recent biomedical interest in UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 copy-number variations (CNVs) within human populations, the impact of their gene dosage has been hampered by the lack of precise molecular identification of the common deletion breakpoints within high homology sequence regions on chromosome 4. We have characterized these common deletions and report their coexistence in Caucasians, along with the p.D85Y (rs1902023:G>T) functional polymorphism of UGT2B15. Segmental duplications of 4.9 kb for UGT2B17 and 6.8 kb for UGT2B28 comprise purine-rich recombination sites located 117 kb and 108 kb apart on both ends of the deletions. CNVs of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 occur in Caucasians at 27% and 13.5%, respectively. While only 43% have two copies of both genes, 57% harbor at least one deletion. Their co-occurrence on 5% of chromosomes creates a 225-kb genomic gap. CNVs of both UGT2B17 and UGT2B28, with the co-occurrence of UGT2B15:p.D85Y, generate seven distinct haplotypes. Restricting the analyses to CNV of the UGT2B17 gene without evaluating UGT2B28 CNV, along with the genotype of UGT2B15, may over- or underestimate the impact of each gene under physiological conditions or disease states.
Recent evidence support that the c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1)/COPS5 has an oncogenic function in various tissues. We show that JAB1 amplification in human prostate cancer (PCa) correlates with reduced overall survival and disease-free progression. Immunohistochemical staining shows enhanced expression of JAB1 in the cytoplasmic compartment of PCa cells compared to the normal prostate epithelium, indicating the activity/function of JAB1 is altered in PCa. To test the function of JAB1 in PCa, we efficiently silenced JAB1 expression using four unique shRNAs in three PCa cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, and PC-3) and an immortalized prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1. Our data clearly show that silencing JAB1 robustly suppresses the growth of PCa cells, but not RWPE-1 cells, suggesting that PCa cells become addicted to JAB1. To study the potential mechanism by which JAB1 controls PCa growth, we profiled gene expression changes by whole transcriptome microarray analysis of C4-2 cells silenced for JAB1 using a pool of 3 shRNAs compared to scrambled shRNA control. We identified 1268 gene changes >/=1.5 fold by silencing JAB1 in C4-2. Western blot confirmation and bioinformatics pathway analyses support that PCa cells become addicted to JAB1 through controlling the following signaling pathways: cell cycle, p53 signaling, DNA replication, TGF-beta/BMP, MAPK, TNF, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. We propose that UGT2B28, UGT2B10, UGT2B11, Skp2, EZH2, MDM2, BIRC5 (Survivin), UBE2C, and Smads 1/5/8, which are all associated with the abovementioned key oncogenic pathways, may play critical roles in the putative oncogenic function of JAB1 in PCa.
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) induces anti-tumor immunity and aids in dismantling the immunosuppressive immune microenvironment (TME), which belongs to a type of regulated cell death. The differentiation of gastric cancer (GC) subtypes and the discovery of prognostic biomarkers are crucial for its treatment because GC is a disease that is both highly heterogeneous and aggressive. However, although the induction of ICD in tumor cells is associated with a favorable prognosis, the exact mechanism of its role in GC remains unclear. Transcriptome profiling data and clinical data of GC patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Herein, patients were classified with the consensus clustering algorithm, and the associated biological functions and immune microenvironment infiltration were explored based on the expression of ICD-associated genes. A risk score signature consisting of 11 ICD-related genes was established via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) method. We have retrieved similar studies in recent years and compared them with our study using the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were performed to explore the association between the signature and tumor microenvironment (TME). Two distinct subtypes associated with ICD in GC were identified, each with a different prognosis. The ICD-high expression subtype was associated with higher immune cell infiltration and a better prognosis. The ICD-related gene signature containing 11 genes (CGB5, Z84468.1, APOA5, EPHA8, CLEC18C, TLR7, MUC7, MUC15, CTLA4, CALB2, and UGT2B28), could independently and accurately predict the prognosis of GC. In this study, an ICD-based classification was conducted to assist in the diagnosis and personalized therapy for GC. The ICD-related genes risk score model was established to predict prognosis.
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes belonging to the UGT2B subfamily catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid to a large number of endogenous compounds, particularly steroids, to facilitate their elimination from target cells. A novel human UGT2B cDNA of 1666 bp was isolated and encodes a 529-amino acid protein named UGT2B28 type I. Glucuronidation assays demonstrated that UGT2B28 type I catalyzes the conjugation of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The tissue distribution of UGT2B28 revealed the expression of the type I transcript in the liver, breast, and LNCaP cells. Two other UGT2B cDNAs were isolated, and sequence analysis led to the identification of two truncated UGT2B28 species. UGT2B28 type II differs from type I by a deletion of 308 bp in the cofactor binding domain, whereas UGT2B28 type III lacks 351 bp in the putative substrate binding domain. All UGT2B28 isoforms are encoded by a single UGT2B28 gene which has a genomic organization similar to that of the other UGT2B genes characterized thus far. Although no substrates could be identified for the shorter isoforms, the three subtypes were shown to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the perinuclear membrane, demonstrating that the missing domains are not required for the subcellular localization of these UGT2B proteins. However, all the domains remain necessary for observing glucuronidation activity. The expression of UGT2B28 type I in the breast and liver suggests a role of this enzyme in the androgen and estrogen metabolism in these tissues.
Endometriosis is an enigmatic condition with an unknown etiology and a poorly understood pathogenesis. It is considered to appear from the interplay of many genetic and environmental factors, affecting up to 10% of women and represents a major cause of pain and infertility. The familial association of endometriosis, as demonstrated through monozygotic twin and family studies suggests a genetic contribution to the disease, with further case‑control and genome‑wide association studies (GWAS) detecting various endometriosis risk factors. In a recent study, we described a unique, three‑generation family of Cretan origin (Greece) with 7 females with surgically confirmed endometriosis (grandmother, 3 daughters and 3 granddaughters). All the affected members of this family displayed a variety of clinical manifestations and complications. In the present study, to further analyze the genetic variants conferring the risk of developing endometriosis, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed, using the AmpliSeq technology on the Ion Proton platform. An initial analysis of 64 variants that were detected across the 14 genes previously confirmed to be associated with endometriosis, did not identify any deleterious exonic variants in these genes. However, further analysis revealed 2 hemizygous deletions in the grandmother that segregate in several of her affected offspring. The first deletion was found in the UGT2B28 locus, spanning 7 informative sequence variants across at least 14 kb. The second deletion, located in USP17L2, spans 3 informative variants across at least 2 kb. On the whole, the findings of the presents study implicate 2 additional genes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, apart from those already identified by GWAS.
Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a potent mycotoxin that induces hepatocellular carcinoma in many animal species, including humans. In this study, we examined the effects of AFB1 on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line). The cells were treated with AFB1 for 48 h at a concentration of 10 muM, and their viability (87%) was not significantly different from that of control cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the mRNAs of four UGT1As (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4 and UGT1A9) and seven UGT2Bs (UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10, UGT2B11, UGT2B15, UGT2B17 and UGT2B28) are expressed in HepG2 cells. The mRNAs of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as transcriptional regulators were also detected. AFB1 significantly increased mRNA levels of UGT1A3, UGT2B10, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in HepG2 cells to 2.5-, 2.0-, 1.9- and 1.5-fold, respectively, whereas the mRNA levels of transcriptional regulators were hardly affected by AFB1. These findings suggest that AFB1 induces UGT2B isoforms rather than UGT1A isoforms in HepG2 cells, and that the change may closely contribute to the toxicity of AFB1.
BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in combination with the Western-style diet, physical inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and obesity have been hypothesized to affect colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Metabolizers of environmental carcinogenic and endogenous compounds affecting CRC risk include the phase II detoxification UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT2B17 and UGT2B28, which are 2 of the most commonly deleted genes in the genome. METHODS: To study the effect of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 copy number variation (CNV) on CRC risk, 665 Caucasian CRC cases and 621 Caucasian controls were genotyped who had completed extensive demographics and lifestyle questionnaires. RESULTS: A significant association between the UGT2B17 deletion genotype (0/0) and decreased CRC risk was found when the entire population was analyzed (P = .044). Stratification by sex yielded a decreased risk (P = .020) in men with the UGT2B17 deletion (0/0), but no association was observed in women (P = .724). A significant association between UGT2B17 (0/0) and decreased risk for rectal (P = .0065) but not colon cancer was found. No significant association was found between UGT2B28 CNV and CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: The UGT2B17 deletion genotype (0/0) was associated with a decreased CRC risk in a Caucasian population. After sex stratification, the association was observed in men but not in women, which is consistent with previous findings that men have higher UGT2B17 expression and activity than women. Because UGT2B17 metabolizes certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and flavonoids with antioxidative properties, individuals with a gene deletion may have higher levels of these protective dietary components.
BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive solid tumor. HCC occurred at younger and elder ages were considered driven by different oncogenic mechanisms, and they demonstrated distinct clinical courses. METHODS: A total of 382 HCC patients treated by surgical resections was analyzed. RESULTS: A univariate-multivariate analysis showed that viral etiology (chronic hepatitis B, C) and the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B28 (UGT2B28) genomic variant rs2132039 were independently associated with the age at presentation of HCC (all adjusted P < 0.05). An extensive evaluations of clinicalpathological factors showed that the age (Odds ratio [OR], 1.016; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.032; adjusted P = 0.037) and ascites (OR, 3.505; CI, 1.358-9.048; adjusted P = 0.010) were two independent factors associated with this genomic variant. The age was 54.1 +/- 14.6 years for patients with the "TT" variant type, and 58.2 +/- 13.7 years for those with the "Non-TT" variant type. The age disparity was most prominent in alcoholic patients (OR, 1.079; CI, 1.035-1.125; P < 0.001, age of "TT", 49.6 +/- 12.2; age of "non-TT", 59.3 +/- 10.7). This genomic variant was also associated with age of recurrence (P = 0.025), distant metastasis (P = 0.024) and HCC-related death (P = 0.008) in non-censored patients. CONCLUSIONS: An UGT2B28 genomic variant was indicative of the age of HCC presentation, recurrence, distant metastasis and death.
BACKGROUND: Addison's disease (AD) is caused by an autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex. The pathogenesis is multi-factorial, involving genetic components and hitherto unknown environmental factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate if gene dosage in the form of copy number variation (CNV) could add to the repertoire of genetic susceptibility to autoimmune AD. METHODS: A genome-wide study using the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 was conducted in 26 patients with AD. CNVs in selected genes were further investigated in a larger material of patients with autoimmune AD (n = 352) and healthy controls (n = 353) by duplex Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: We found that low copy number of UGT2B28 was significantly more frequent in AD patients compared to controls; conversely high copy number of ADAM3A was associated with AD. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two novel CNV associations to ADAM3A and UGT2B28 in AD. The mechanism by which this susceptibility is conferred is at present unclear, but may involve steroid inactivation (UGT2B28) and T cell maturation (ADAM3A). Characterization of these proteins may unravel novel information on the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.
UGT2B17 is one of the most important enzymes for androgen metabolism. In addition, the UGT2B17 gene is one of the most commonly deleted regions of the human genome. The deletion was previously found associated with higher femoral bone density in men and women, and we replicated this association in a sample of postmenopausal who never used hormone therapy. INTRODUCTION: Deletion of the UGT2B17 gene was previously shown to be associated with a higher hip bone mineral density (BMD). Using a PCR assay, we tried to replicate the association among a large group of 2,379 women. We examined the effect of the deletion on femoral neck BMD and lumbar spine BMD according to the menopausal status and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). METHODS: We used a high-throughput PCR assay to identify the gene and the deletion in a population of well-characterized women. Two additional polymorphisms, UGT2B28 deletion and UGT2B15 rs1902023 G > T were also investigated. RESULTS: Only UGT2B17 deletion was associated with LS and FN BMD. Furthermore, the association was seen only among postmenopausal women who had never used hormone replacement as in the first reported association. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association between UGT2B17 deletion and a higher LS and FN BMD. In addition, we show that the association is observed among postmenopausal women who never used HRT consistent with the enzymatic function of UGT2B17. The analysis shows that those having one or two UGT2B17 alleles benefit from HRT, which is not the case for null carriers.
