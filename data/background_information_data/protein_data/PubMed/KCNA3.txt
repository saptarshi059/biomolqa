Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 3; Mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane, the protein forms a potassium-selective channel through which potassium ions may pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient.
Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), characterized by irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, swelling of the pancreas, and histological evidence of lymphoplasmacytic inflammation by high serum immunoglobulin G4, is distinct from ordinary pancreatitis. However, genetic factors involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of AIP remain unclear. Sixty-four patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (53 men, 11 women; mean age, 62.4 years) and 104 healthy Japanese controls were enrolled in this study. We performed an association analysis using 400 microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 10.8 cM in the genome. We also evaluated the association of AIP with seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 20-kb region around the potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related subfamily, member 3 gene (KCNA3). We identified six statistically significant markers (D1S2726, D5S410, D6S460, D10S548, D15S128, and D20S186; P< 0.05) related to susceptibility. The surrounding region showing the strong association (P=7.4 x 10<formula>;-7</formula>, Pc=0.0015) contained the KCNA3 gene. Further analysis by SNP genotyping in KCNA3 gene revealed that four SNPs (rs2840381, rs1058184, rs2640480, rs1319782) were significantly associated with the AIP susceptibility (P< 0.007). KCNA3 is known to be involved in immunomodulation of autoreactive effector and memory T cell--mediated autoimmune diseases. Our findings provide the first evidence that KCNA3 is associated with AIP and suggest that KCNA3 may influence the risk for AIP.
The rate of symptom accumulation distinguishes between slowly and rapidly progressing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Given that a patient's genetics can affect the rate of disease progression, identification of genetic variants associated with rapid disease progression should provide valuable information for timely prognosis and development of optimal treatment plans. We hypothesized that the polymorphism rs2821557 in the human KCNA3 gene encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 might be one of these genetic variants, given the role of Kv1.3 in neuroinflammation, as well as the location and gain-of-function effect of this polymorphism. To test this hypothesis we performed an analytic study exploring the relationships between rs2821557 polymorphism and disease progression in a cohort of MS patients. The rs2821557 genotype and the rate of disease progression based on Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) were determined for 101 patients (68 females and 33 males). Peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations (T(naive) , T(CM) , T(EM) ) and the expression of chemokine receptors (CXCR5, CXCR3, CCR6, CCR4) were estimated by flow cytometry. The comparisons between groups by genotype (TT, TC, CC) and allelic approach analysis (T vs. C) revealed a significantly higher incidence of the rapid disease course (MSSS >/= 7.5) among minor C allele carriers (CC and TC) compared to patients with the TT genotype. Furthermore, C allele carriers had higher counts of CXCR3+ T(EM) cells than homozygous T allele carriers. In conclusion, accelerated MS progression in C allele carriers is likely linked to enhanced Kv1.3-mediated accumulation of pathogenic CXCR3+ T(EM) cells and exacerbated neuroinflammation.
BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is a highly lethal disease lacking early detection approaches. We previously identified that OTOP2 and KCNA3 were specifically hypermethylated in circulating cell-free DNA from patients with EC. We then developed a blood-based methylation assay targeting OTOP2 and KCNA3 (named "IEsohunter") for esophageal cancer noninvasive detection. This double-blinded, multicenter, prospective study aimed to comprehensively evaluate its clinical diagnostic performance. METHODS: Participants with EC, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), other malignancies, benign gastrointestinal lesions, or no abnormalities were prospectively enrolled from 5 tertiary referral centers across China. Peripheral blood samples were collected, followed by plasma cell-free DNA methylation analysis using the IEsohunter test based on multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction adopting an algorithm-free interpretation strategy. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of IEsohunter test for EC. RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 1116 participants, including 334 patients with EC, 71 with HGIN, and 711 controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the IEsohunter test for detecting EC and HGIN were 0.903 (95% CI 0.880-0.927) and 0.727 (95% CI 0.653-0.801), respectively. IEsohunter test showed sensitivities of 78.5% (95% CI 69.1-85.6), 87.3% (95% CI 79.4-92.4), 92.5% (95% CI 85.9-96.2), and 96.9% (95% CI 84.3-99.8) for stage I-IV EC, respectively, with an overall sensitivity of 87.4% (95% CI 83.4-90.6) and specificity of 93.3% (95% CI 91.2-94.9) for EC detection. The IEsohunter test status turned negative (100.0%, 47/47) after surgical resection of EC. CONCLUSIONS: The IEsohunter test showed high diagnostic accuracy for EC detection, indicating that it could potentially serve as a tool for noninvasive early detection and surveillance of EC.
BACKGROUND: Early detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) can considerably improve the prognosis of patients. Aberrant cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation signatures are a promising tool for detecting ESCC. However, available markers based on cell-free DNA methylation are still inadequate. This study aimed to identify ESCC-specific cfDNA methylation markers and evaluate the diagnostic performance in the early detection of ESCC. METHODS: We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for 24 ESCC tissues and their normal adjacent tissues. Based on the WGBS data, we identified 21,469,837 eligible CpG sites (CpGs). By integrating several methylation datasets, we identified several promising ESCC-specific cell-free DNA methylation markers. Finally, we developed a dual-marker panel based on methylated KCNA3 and OTOP2 , and then, we evaluated its performance in our training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: The ESCC diagnostic model constructed based on KCNA3 and OTOP2 had an AUC of 0.91 [95% CI: 0.85-0.95], and an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 84.91% and 94.32%, respectively, in the training cohort. In the independent validation cohort, the AUC was 0.88 [95% CI: 0.83-0.92], along with an optimal sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 92.9%. The model sensitivity for stage I-II ESCC was 78.4%, which was slightly lower than the sensitivity of the model (85.7%) for stage III-IV ESCC. CONCLUSION: The dual-target panel based on cfDNA showed excellent performance for detecting ESCC and might be an alternative strategy for screening ESCC.
