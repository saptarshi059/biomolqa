Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health concern affecting millions worldwide. One of the critical challenges in CKD is the accumulation of uremic toxins such as p-cresol sulfate (pCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS), which contribute to systemic damage and CKD progression. Understanding the transport mechanisms of these prominent toxins is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, we investigated whether pCS and IS are routed to the plasma membrane or to the cytosol by two key transporters, SLC22A11 and OAT1. To distinguish between cytosolic transport and plasma membrane insertion, we used a hyperosmolarity assay in which the accumulation of substrates into HEK-293 cells in isotonic and hypertonic buffers was measured in parallel using LC-MS/MS. Judging from the efficiency of transport (TE), pCS is a relevant substrate of SLC22A11 at 7.8 +/- 1.4 microL min(-1) mg protein(-1) but not as good as estrone-3-sulfate; OAT1 translocates pCS less efficiently. The TE of SLC22A11 for IS was similar to pCS. For OAT1, however, IS is an excellent substrate. With OAT1 and p-aminohippuric acid, our study revealed an influence of transporter abundance on the outcomes of the hyperosmolarity assay; very high transport activity confounded results. SLC22A11 was found to insert both pCS and IS into the plasma membrane, whereas OAT1 conveys these toxins to the cytosol. These disparate transport mechanisms bear profound ramifications for toxicity. Membrane insertion might promote membrane damage and microvesicle release. Our results underscore the imperative for detailed structural inquiries into the translocation of small molecules.
Genetic variations in urate transporters play a significant role in determining human urate levels and have been implicated in developing hyperuricemia or gout. Polymorphism in the key urate transporters, such as ABCG2, URAT1, or GLUT9 was well-documented in the literature. Therefore in this study, our objective was to determine the frequency and effect of rare nonsynonymous allelic variants of SLC22A11, SLC22A13, and SLC17A1 on urate transport. In a cohort of 150 Czech patients with primary hyperuricemia and gout, we examined all coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of SLC22A11, SLC22A13, and SLC17A1 using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. For comparison, we used a control group consisting of 115 normouricemic subjects. To examine the effects of the rare allelic nonsynonymous variants on the expression, intracellular processing, and urate transporter protein function, we performed a functional characterization using the HEK293A cell line, immunoblotting, fluorescent microscopy, and site directed mutagenesis for preparing variants in vitro. Variants p.V202M (rs201209258), p.R343L (rs75933978), and p.P519L (rs144573306) were identified in the SLC22A11 gene (OAT4 transporter); variants p.R16H (rs72542450), and p.R102H (rs113229654) in the SLC22A13 gene (OAT10 transporter); and the p.W75C variant in the SLC17A1 gene (NPT1 transporter). All variants minimally affected protein levels and cytoplasmic/plasma membrane localization. The functional in vitro assay revealed that contrary to the native proteins, variants p.P519L in OAT4 (p </= 0.05), p.R16H in OAT10 (p </= 0.05), and p.W75C in the NPT1 transporter (p </= 0.01) significantly limited urate transport activity. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of (1) the risk of urate transporter-related hyperuricemia/gout and (2) uric acid handling in the kidneys.
Obesity, a risk factor for multiple diseases (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cancers) originates through complex interactions between genes and prevailing environment (food habit and lifestyle) that varies across populations. Indians exhibit a unique obesity phenotype with high abdominal adiposity for a given body weight compared to matched white populations suggesting presence of population-specific genetic and environmental factors influencing obesity. However, Indian population-specific genetic contributors for obesity have not been explored yet. Therefore, to identify potential genetic contributors, we performed a two-staged genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body mass index (BMI), a common measure to evaluate obesity in 5973 Indian adults and the lead findings were further replicated in 1286 Indian adolescents. Our study revealed novel association of variants-rs6913677 in BAI3 gene (p = 1.08 x 10(-8)) and rs2078267 in SLC22A11 gene (p = 4.62 x 10(-8)) at GWAS significance, and of rs8100011 in ZNF45 gene (p = 1.04 x 10(-7)) with near GWAS significance. As genetic loci may dictate the phenotype through modulation of epigenetic processes, we overlapped genetic data of identified signals with their DNA methylation patterns in 236 Indian individuals and performed methylation quantitative trait loci (meth-QTL) analysis. Further, functional roles of discovered variants and underlying genes were speculated using publicly available gene regulatory databases (ENCODE, JASPAR, GeneHancer, GTEx). The identified variants in BAI3 and SLC22A11 genes were found to dictate methylation patterns at unique CpGs harboring critical cis-regulatory elements. Further, BAI3, SLC22A11 and ZNF45 variants were located in repressive chromatin, active enhancer, and active chromatin regions, respectively, in human subcutaneous adipose tissue in ENCODE database. Additionally, these genomic regions represented potential binding sites for key transcription factors implicated in obesity and/or metabolic disorders. Interestingly, GTEx portal identify rs8100011 as a robust cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 1.6 x 10(-7)), and ZNF45 gene expression in skeletal muscle of Indian subjects showed an inverse correlation with BMI indicating its possible role in obesity. In conclusion, our study discovered 3 novel population-specific functional genetic variants (rs6913677, rs2078267, rs8100011) in 2 novel (SLC22A11 and ZNF45) and 1 earlier reported gene (BAI3) for BMI in Indians. Our study decodes key genomic loci underlying obesity phenotype in Indians that may serve as prospective drug targets in future.
Gout, a common disease, is a consequence of hyperuricemia, and increases the risks of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and renal failure. Gout can be classified into 3 types: the renal underexcretion (RUE) type, renal overload type and combined type. RUE type is a major type of gout; however, its genetic causes are still unclear. Since human organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4/SLC22A11) is expressed in the kidney and mediates urate transport, we investigated the effects of a common variant of OAT4/SLC22A11 on the susceptibility to gout. Five hundred and forty-five Japanese male gout cases and 1,115 male individuals as a control group were genotyped with rs17300741, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the OAT4/SLC22A11 gene. The association analysis of rs17300741 showed no significant association for all gout cases; however, there was a slight but significant association for RUE type gout cases (p = 0.049). These results also suggest that OAT4 contributes to urate transport at the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells in humans. Our findings make it clear for the first time that a common variant of OAT4/SLC22A11 is associated with RUE type gout, a major gout subtype.
INTRODUCTION: There is inconsistent association between urate transporters SLC22A11 (organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4)) and SLC22A12 (urate transporter 1 (URAT1)) and risk of gout. New Zealand (NZ) Maori and Pacific Island people have higher serum urate and more severe gout than European people. The aim of this study was to test genetic variation across the SLC22A11/SLC22A12 locus for association with risk of gout in NZ sample sets. METHODS: A total of 12 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in four haplotype blocks were genotyped using TaqMan(R) and Sequenom MassArray in 1003 gout cases and 1156 controls. All cases had gout according to the 1977 American Rheumatism Association criteria. Association analysis of single markers and haplotypes was performed using PLINK and Stata. RESULTS: A haplotype block 1 SNP (rs17299124) (upstream of SLC22A11) was associated with gout in less admixed Polynesian sample sets, but not European Caucasian (odds ratio; OR = 3.38, P = 6.1 x 10-4; OR = 0.91, P = 0.40, respectively) sample sets. A protective block 1 haplotype caused the rs17299124 association (OR = 0.28, P = 6.0 x 10-4). Within haplotype block 2 (SLC22A11) we could not replicate previous reports of association of rs2078267 with gout in European Caucasian (OR = 0.98, P = 0.82) sample sets, however this SNP was associated with gout in Polynesian (OR = 1.51, P = 0.022) sample sets. Within haplotype block 3 (including SLC22A12) analysis of haplotypes revealed a haplotype with trans-ancestral protective effects (OR = 0.80, P = 0.004), and a second haplotype conferring protection in less admixed Polynesian sample sets (OR = 0.63, P = 0.028) but risk in European Caucasian samples (OR = 1.33, P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides evidence for multiple ancestral-specific effects across the SLC22A11/SLC22A12 locus that presumably influence the activity of OAT4 and URAT1 and risk of gout. Further fine mapping of the association signal is needed using trans-ancestral re-sequence data.
Estrone sulfate alias estrone-3-sulfate (E3S) is considerably larger and much more hydrophobic than typical substrates of SLC22 transporters. It is puzzling that many otherwise unrelated transporters have been reported to transport E3S. Here we scrutinized the mechanism of transport of E3S by SLC22A11 (alias OAT4), by direct comparison with uric acid (UA), an important physiological substrate. Heterologous expression of SLC22A11 in human 293 cells gave rise to a huge unidirectional efflux of glutamate (Glu) and aspartate, as determined by LC-MS/MS. The uptake of E3S was 20-fold faster than the uptake of UA. Yet, the outward transport of Glu was inhibited by extracellular E3S, but not by UA. The release of E3S after preloading was trans-stimulated by extracellular dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), but neither by UA nor 6-carboxyfluorescein (6CF). The equilibrium accumulation of E3S was enhanced 3-fold by replacement of chloride with gluconate, but the opposite effect was observed for UA. These results establish that SLC22A11 provides entirely different transport mechanisms for E3S and UA. Therefore, E3S must not be used as a substitute for UA to assay the function of SLC22A11. In equilibrium accumulation experiments, the transporter-mediated uptake was a linear function of the concentration of UA and 6CF. By contrast, in the same concentration range the graph for E3S was hyperbolic. This suggests that SLC22A11 inserts E3S into a small volume with limited capacity, the plasma membrane. Our data support the notion that the reverse process, extraction from the membrane, is also catalyzed by the carrier.
Phenolic acids exert beneficial health effects such as anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory activities and show systemic exposure after consumption of common fruits, vegetables, and beverages. However, knowledge regarding which components convey therapeutic benefits and the mechanism(s) by which they cross cell membranes is extremely limited. Therefore, we determined the inhibitory effects of nine food-derived phenolic acids, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, gentisic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, sinapinic acid, syringic acid, and vanillic acid, on human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1), hOAT3, and hOAT4. In the present study, inhibition of OAT-mediated transport of prototypical substrates (1 muM) by phenolic acids (100 muM) was examined in stably expressing cell lines. All compounds significantly inhibited hOAT3 transport, while just ferulic, gallic, protocatechuic, sinapinic, and vanillic acid significantly blocked hOAT1 activity. Only sinapinic acid inhibited hOAT4 (~35%). For compounds exhibiting inhibition > ~60%, known clinical plasma concentration levels and plasma protein binding in humans were examined to select compounds to evaluate further with dose-response curves (IC(50) values) and drug-drug interaction (DDI) index determinations. IC(50) values ranged from 1.24 to 18.08 muM for hOAT1 and from 7.35 to 87.36 muM for hOAT3. Maximum DDI indices for gallic and gentisic acid (>>0.1) indicated a very strong potential for DDIs on hOAT1 and/or hOAT3. This study indicates that gallic acid from foods or supplements, or gentisic acid from salicylate-based drug metabolism, may significantly alter the pharmacokinetics (efficacy and toxicity) of concomitant therapeutics that are hOAT1 and/or hOAT3 substrates.
