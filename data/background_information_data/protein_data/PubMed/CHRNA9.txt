Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-9; Ionotropic receptor with a probable role in the modulation of auditory stimuli. Agonist binding induces a conformation change that leads to the opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane. The channel is permeable to a range of divalent cations including calcium, the influx of which may activate a potassium current which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane. In the ear, this may lead to a reduction in basilar membrane motion, altering the activity of auditory nerve fibers and reducing the range of dynamic hearing. This ma [...] 
Previous studies indicated that smoking exposure is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and alpha9-nicotine acetylcholine receptors (alpha9-nAChRs) are involved in breast tumorigenesis. However, no studies have explored the joint effect of alpha9-nAChRs (CHRNA9) genes and cigarette smoking exposure on breast cancer risk. A case-control study was conducted on 737 breast cancer patients and 719 age-matched healthy controls. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CHRNA9 located in the promoter region were genotyped and compared between cases and controls to identify those SNPs associated with breast cancer susceptibility. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to analyze the promoter activities of these SNPs of the CHRNA9 gene. After a Bonferroni correction, the G allele of the CHRNA9 rs7329797 SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer compared with A/A genotype carriers (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.6). A multiplicative interaction between passive smoking exposure and the CHRNA9 rs73229797 SNP on the risk of breast malignancy was observed. A functional assay further showed that rs73229797 was associated with increased promoter activity of the CHRNA9 gene. Our findings support a significant interaction effect existing between the CHRNA9 gene and smoking exposure on the risk of breast cancer development.
Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-9 (CHRNA9) encodes a plasma membrane protein of divalent cation channels and is expressed in keratinocytes. This study aimed to investigate CHRNA9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) risk, in a Chinese population. This case-control study included 500 NSCLC patients and 500 age-matched healthy controls. CHRNA9 rs56159866, rs6819385, rs55998310, and rs182073550 SNPs were genotyped and associated for NSCLC risk by computing the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age. The frequencies of the CHRNA9 rs6819385 G allele were 16.1, 15.2, and 20.8% in male NSCLC patients, male SCC patients, and male controls, respectively. The CHRNA9 rs6819385 A allele was associated with an increased risk of developing NSCLC (P = 0.04, OR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.02-1.83) and SCC (P = 0.04, OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.01-2.13). The CHRNA9 rs6819385 A/A homozygote was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC and SCC in all patients (OR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.06-1.79; P = 0.02, and OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.09-2.38; P = 0.02, respectively) and in male patients (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.11-2.21; P = 0.01, and OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.11-2.61; P = 0.01, respectively), indicating that the CHRNA9 rs6819385 A/A homozygote had a 1.61-fold and 1.70-fold increased risk of developing lung SCC in all patients (95% CI 1.09-2.38, P = 0.02) and in males (95% CI 1.11-2.61, P = 0.01), respectively. The CHRNA9 rs6819385 SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of NSCLC, especially for SCC in male patients in this Chinese population.
Though the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits alpha9 and alpha 10 have been thoroughly characterized within hair cells of the organ of Corti in the inner ear, prior studies have shown that they are also expressed in lymphocytes. In this report, we sought to more definitively characterize the nAChR subunits alpha9 and alpha10 within various populations of human lymphocytes. Using a combination of techniques, including RT-PCR, single-cell RT-PCR, Northern and western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence, expression of both alpha9 and alpha 10 was demonstrated in purified populations of T-cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and the Jurkat, MT2 and CEM T-cell lines) and B-cells (CD19+, CD80+ and EBV-immortalized B-cells). Single-lymphocyte recording techniques failed to identify an ionic current in response to applied acetylcholine in either T-cells or B-cells. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of these nicotinic receptor subunits within several populations of human lymphocytes, implicating their role in the immune response. However, a lack of demonstrated response to applied acetylcholine using standard single-cell recording techniques suggests a physiology different than that seen in hair cells of the inner ear.
The human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit alpha9 gene (CHRNA9) codes for a component of the AChR in hair cells of the inner ear. While no direct evidence presently links this gene to known hearing disorders, it may underlie individual susceptibility to acoustic inner ear injury, and is associated with the autoimmune skin disorder Pemphigus vulgaris. Future studies will depend upon a thorough characterization of the nAChR alpha9 gene. CHRNA9 was localized to chromosome 4p15.1-->p14 by FISH analysis. Radiation hybrid mapping further localized the gene between markers D4S405 and D4S496 (Stanford G3 panel), and between markers WI-3875 and D4S1231 (Genebridge 4 panel), representing a distance of approximately 3.1 cR. The D4S405 marker has been linked to a non-syndromic form of hereditary hearing loss, DFNB-25. The gene contains five exons, separated by four introns. Exons 1-5 are 78, 145, 154, 532 and 877 bases, respectively. Introns 1-4 are 294, 1239, 11517, and 4571 bases, respectively. The intron-exon splice junction sites correlate identically with those of the rat alpha9 gene and are nearly identical to those of the human alpha10 gene. Sequence promoter analysis reveals a number of potential regulatory elements, including several in common with the nAChR alpha10 gene, whose expressed protein is assumed to combine with alpha9 in the inner ear.
