Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1; Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells; Belongs to th [...] 
Tissue regeneration after injury involves the dedifferentiation of somatic cells, a natural adaptive reprogramming that leads to the emergence of injury-responsive cells with fetal-like characteristics. However, there is no direct evidence that adaptive reprogramming involves a shared molecular mechanism with direct cellular reprogramming. Here, we induced dedifferentiation of intestinal epithelial cells using OSKM (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) in vivo. The OSKM-induced forced dedifferentiation showed similar molecular features of intestinal regeneration, including a transition from homeostatic cell types to injury-responsive-like cell types. These injury-responsive-like cells, sharing gene signatures of revival stem cells and atrophy-induced villus epithelial cells, actively assisted tissue regeneration following damage. In contrast to normal intestinal regeneration involving Ptgs2 induction, the OSKM promotes autonomous production of prostaglandin E2 via epithelial Ptgs1 expression. These results indicate prostaglandin synthesis is a common mechanism for intestinal regeneration but involves a different enzyme when partial reprogramming is applied to the intestinal epithelium.
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) exerts an anti-tumor effect in multiple cancers, however, the molecular mechanism of DHA and whether DHA facilitates the anti-tumor efficacy of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are unclear. Here, we found that DHA potentiated the anti-tumor effects of cisplatin in NSCLC cells by stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, C-Jun-amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. Of note, we demonstrated for the first time that DHA inhibits prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 (PTGS1) expression, resulting in enhanced ROS production. Importantly, silencing PTGS1 sensitized DHA-induced cell death by increasing ROS production and activating ER-stress, JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. In summary, our findings provided new experimental basis and therapeutic prospect for the combined therapy with DHA and cisplatin in some NSCLC patients.
Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mass and increased bone fragility, is a disease prevalent in women. Likewise, breast cancer is a multifactorial disease and considered the major cause of mortality in premenopausal and postmenopausal women worldwide. Our data demonstrated the association of the MYLK gene and PTGS1 gene variants with osteoporosis and benign breast tumor risk and the impact of ovariectomy on osteoporosis in Korean women. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of women with osteoporosis and benign breast tumors. There were 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 12 SNPs in the MYLK and PTGS1 genes, associated with benign breast tumors and osteoporosis. Our study showed that women with homozygous MYLK rs12163585 major alleles had an increased risk of osteoporosis following ovariectomy compared to those with minor alleles. Women carrying the minor PTGS1 rs1213265 allele and not treated via ovariectomy carried a higher risk of osteoporosis than those who underwent ovariectomy with a homozygous genotype at the major alleles. Our results suggest that both the MYLK and PTGS1 genes are genetic factors associated with the phenotypes, and these associations appear to be modulated by ovariectomy.
BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated whether the polymorphisms in the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) and PTGS2 genes and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use are associated with cancer risk; however, those studies have produced mixed results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the PTGS1 and PTGS2 polymorphisms and the effect of NSAID use on the risk of developing cancer. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed through March 2012. The odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the fixed-effect model or the random-effect model. RESULTS: The database search generated 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria. For PTGS1 rs3842787, NSAID users homozygous for the major allele (CC) had a significantly decreased cancer risk compared with non-NSAID users (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59-0.89). For PTGS2 rs5275 and rs20417, there were no significant differences between the gene polymorphism and NSAID use on cancer risk among the 8 and 7 studies, respectively. However, in the stratified analysis by the type of cancer or ethnicity population, NSAID users homozygous for the major allele (TT) in rs5275 demonstrated significantly decreased cancer risk compared with non-NSAID users in cancer type not involving colorectal adenoma (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59-0.83) and among the USA population (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56-0.82). NSAID users homozygous for the major allele (GG) in rs20417 displayed a significantly decreased cancer risk than non-NSAID users among the US population (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.58-0.88). For the PTGS2 rs689466 and rs2745557 SNPs, there were no significant differences. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that the associations between PTGS polymorphisms and NSAID use on cancer risk may differ with regard to the type of cancer and nationality.
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vascular disease complicated by coronary artery injury. Although polymorphisms in prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) are being increasingly explored in cardiovascular diseases, little is known regarding the connection between PTGS1 polymorphisms and KD risk. We evaluated 834 KD patients and 1474 healthy controls to explore the relationship between PTGS1 polymorphisms (rs1330344 and rs5788) and KD risk. Our results showed that the rs1330344 CC genotype was significantly associated with KD risk and coronary artery injury in children with KD. In combined analysis, individuals with 1-2 unfavorable genotypes had an increased risk of KD, compared with those with no risk genotype. Stratified analysis indicated that the rs1330344 CC genotype is strongly associated with increased risk of KD in children aged </=60 months and females. Moreover, carrying 1-2 of these SNP genotypes had a higher risk of KD than those who harbored none of them in children </=60 months of age and females; the risk of coronary artery dilatations/small aneurysms and medium/giant aneurysms was also significantly increased in KD patients. In summary, the PTGS1 rs1330344 CC genotype is associated with increased susceptibility to KD, which may contribute to KD pathogenesis and serve as a genetic biomarker.
Diisocyanates are the most common cause of occupational asthma, but risk factors are not well defined. A case-control study was conducted to investigate whether genetic variants in inflammatory response genes (TNFalpha, IL1alpha, IL1beta, IL1RN, IL10, TGFB1, ADAM33, ALOX-5, PTGS1, PTGS2 and NAG-1/GDF15) are associated with increased susceptibility to diisocyanate asthma (DA). These genes were selected based on their role in asthmatic inflammatory processes and previously reported associations with asthma phenotypes. The main study population consisted of 237 Caucasian French Canadians from among a larger sample of 280 diisocyanate-exposed workers in two groups: workers with specific inhalation challenge (SIC) confirmed DA (DA(+), n = 95) and asymptomatic exposed workers (AW, n = 142). Genotyping was performed on genomic DNA, using a 5' nuclease PCR assay. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables of age, smoking status and duration of exposure, the PTGS1 rs5788 and TGFB1 rs1800469 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) showed a protective effect under a dominant model (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.17, 0.89 and OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.18, 0.74, respectively) while the TNFalpha rs1800629 SNP was associated with an increased risk of DA (OR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.03, 4.17). Additionally, the PTGS2 rs20417 variant showed an association with increased risk of DA in a recessive genetic model (OR = 6.40; 95% CI = 1.06, 38.75). These results suggest that genetic variations in TNFalpha, TGFB1, PTGS1 and PTGS2 genes contribute to DA susceptibility.
Cyclooxygenases (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases, (EC 1.14.99.1) 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2)) are key enzymes with a highly functional and pharmacological relevance. Genetic variations in the corresponding genes PTGS1 and PTGS2 are related to diverse human disorders and adverse drug reactions. Although COX-2 is highly inducible, most genetic association studies have focused on coding region gene variants. The aim of this study is to analyze the genetic variants modifying transcription factor binding sites in human PTGS genes based on the combined use of bioinformatics with 1,000 genomes data and replication by next generation sequencing. Updated information on gene sequences and variants was obtained from the 1,000 genomes website and from a replication sequencing study. Of the 570 upstream PTGS1 gene variants, 43 altered binding sites, either by disrupting existing sequences or by creating new binding sites. The most relevant are the SNP rs72769722, which creates a new binding site for NFKB, and the SNPs rs73559017 and rs76403914, both disrupting binding sites for CDX1. Of the 682 upstream PTGS2 gene variants, 31 altered binding sites, the most relevant being rs689466 and rs20417, which disrupt binding sequences for MYB and E2F, respectively; rs689462 which creates a new binding site for POU3F2; and a haplotype combining the SNPs rs34984585+rs10911904, which creates a new binding site for SRY. This study provides a detailed catalog of variant and invariant transcription factor binding sites for PTGS genes and related haplotypes. This information can be useful to identify potential genetic targets for studies related to COX enzymes.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly effective in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, primary and acquired drug resistance to TKIs have been reported. In this study, we used RNA sequencing followed by RQ-PCR to show that the proto-oncogene EVI1 targets the drug-metabolizing gene PTGS1 in CML. The PTGS1 promoter element had an EVI1 binding site, and CHIP assay confirmed its presence. Data from a publicly available CML microarray dataset and an independent set of CML samples showed a significant positive correlation between EVI1 and PTGS1 expression in CML. Downregulation of EVI1 in K562 cells and subsequent treatment with TKIs resulted in a lower IC(50) in the control cells. Furthermore, combined inhibition of BCR-ABL with imatinib and PTGS1 with FR122047 (PTGS1 inhibitor) synergistically reduced the viability of imatinib-resistant K562 cells. We conclude that elevated EVI1 expression contributes to TKIs resistance and that combined inhibition of PTGS1 and BCR-ABL may represent a novel therapeutic approach.
BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading culprit of cancer-related deaths around the world. Beta-sitosterol (BS) is an important phytosterol that has been proven to have anti-proliferative effects on GC and other tumors. However, mechanisms and targets of BS in cancer are rarely explored. METHODS: In this investigation, the targets of BS in the treatment of GC were analyzed by network pharmacology. Molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay were introduced to validate the binding relationship between BS and PTGS1. The impacts of BS on GC cell viability, half maximal inhibitory concentration, proliferation ability, apoptosis level, and angiogenesis ability were detected by using Cell Counting Kit-8, clone formation assay, flow cytometry, and angiogenesis experiment, respectively. In addition, the expression levels of angiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, PAI-1) were detected by using western blot. RESULTS: In this project, through cell experiments, PTGS1 was identified as a protein that directly binds to BS. In vitro cell experiments revealed that BS promoted apoptosis and inhibited GC cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Importantly, treatment with BS attenuated the promoting influence of PTGS1 overexpression on GC cell proliferation and angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: This investigation highlighted PTGS1 as the target of BS in GC cells. BS can regulate PTGS1 to inhibit GC cell proliferation and angiogenesis, providing new evidence for the potential use of BS as a therapeutic agent for GC.
OBJECTIVE: Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1, PTGS1) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, which is subsequently metabolized to various biologically active prostaglandins. We sought to identify and characterize the functional relevance of genetic polymorphisms in PTGS1. METHODS: Sequence variations in human PTGS1 were identified by resequencing 92 healthy individuals (24 African, 24 Asian, 24 European/Caucasian, and 20 anonymous). Using site-directed mutagenesis and a baculovirus/insect cell expression system, recombinant wild-type COX-1 and the R8W, P17L, R53H, R78W, K185T, G230S, L237M, and V481I variant proteins were expressed. COX-1 metabolic activity was evaluated in vitro using an oxygen consumption assay under basal conditions and in the presence of indomethacin. RESULTS: Forty-five variants were identified, including seven nonsynonymous polymorphisms encoding amino acid substitutions in the COX-1 protein. The R53H (35+/-5%), R78W (36+/-4%), K185T (59+/-6%), G230S (57+/-4%), and L237M (51+/-3%) variant proteins had significantly lower metabolic activity relative to wild-type (100+/-7%), while no significant differences were observed with the R8W (104+/-10%), P17L (113+/-7%), and V481I (121+/-10%) variants. Inhibition studies with indomethacin demonstrated that the P17L and G230S variants had significantly lower IC50 values compared to wild-type, suggesting these variants significantly increase COX-1 sensitivity to indomethacin inhibition. Consistent with the metabolic activity data, protein modeling suggested the G230S variant may disrupt the active conformation of COX-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that several genetic variants in human COX-1 significantly alter basal COX-1-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism and indomethacin-mediated inhibition of COX-1 activity in vitro. Future studies characterizing the functional impact of these variants in vivo are warranted.
PURPOSE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) target the prostaglandin H synthase enzymes, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, and reduce colorectal cancer risk. Genetic variation in the genes encoding these enzymes may be associated with changes in colon and rectal cancer risk and in NSAID efficacy. METHODS: We genotyped candidate polymorphisms and tag SNPs in PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2) in a population-based case-control study (Diet, Activity and Lifestyle Study, DALS) of colon cancer (n = 1,470 cases/1,837 controls) and rectal cancer (n = 583/775), and independently among cases and controls from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR; colon n = 959/1,535, rectal n = 505/839). RESULTS: In PTGS2, a functional polymorphism (-765G[C; rs20417) was associated with a twofold increased rectal cancer risk (p = 0.05) in the DALS. This association replicated with a significant nearly fivefold increased risk of rectal cancer in the CCFR study (ORCC vs. GG = 4.88; 95 % CI 1.54-15.45; ORGC vs. GG = 1.36; 95 %CI 0.95-1.94). Genotype-NSAID interactions were observed in the DALS for PTGS1 and rectal cancer risk and for PTGS2 and colon cancer risk, but were no longer significant after correcting for multiple comparisons and did not replicate in the CCFR. No significant associations between PTGS1 polymorphisms and colon or rectal cancer risk were observed.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between variants in prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1), prostaglandin F (2alpha) receptor (PTGFR), and multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) genes and intraocular pressure (IOP) response to latanoprost in Chinese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS: The IOP response to latanoprost was evaluated by percent IOP reduction (%DeltaIOP) in the treated eye with the formula %DeltaIOP = (Baseline IOP values - IOP values posttreatment) / Baseline IOP values x 100 %. Polymorphisms in PTGS1 (rs3842787 and rs10306114), PTGFR (rs3753380 and rs3766355), and MRP4 (rs11568658 and rs11568668) genes were detected by direct DNA sequencing. The differences among %DeltaIOP of genotypes or haplotypes were obtained by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Association analyses were performed by multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Latanoprost were prescribed to 63 subjects, 60 of which met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the current study. Notably, the %DeltaIOP in the rs11568658 GT heterozygous genotype was 10.4 %DeltaIOP lower than that of GG homozygous wild-type on day 7 (15.7 +/- 2.52 vs. 26.1 +/- 2.88, P=0.003), and the corresponding results in the rs10306114 AG heterozygous genotype and AT haplotype constructed by rs3753380 and rs3766355 on day 7 were 7.2 and 10.3 %DeltaIOP (P<0.05). Interestingly, similar results were also observed on day 30 (P=0.008, P=0.006, and P=0.002, respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that heterozygous genotypes of rs10306114, rs11568658, and carrier of AT haplotype were significantly correlated with the lower %DeltaIOP. On day 30, the above variations explained 9.9, 10.7, and 17.7 % of the total variability of %DeltaIOP in the Chinese POAG patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: rs10306114, rs3753380, rs3766355, and rs11568658 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correlate with a response to latanoprost treatment in patients with POAG. These SNPs may be important determinants of variability in response to latanoprost.
Platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1 (PEAR1) and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) polymorphisms can affect laboratory aspirin resistance. However, the impact of genetic polymorphisms on the recurrence of ischemic stroke (IS) patients treated with aspirin is not fully understood. This study aimed to examine the relationship between gene polymorphisms of PEAR1 and PTGS1 and IS recurrence in patients treated with aspirin. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 174 patients with nonrecurrent IS and 34 with recurrent IS after aspirin treatment. Follow-up was performed on all patients. PEAR1 rs12041331 and PTGS1 rs10306114 polymorphisms were determined using the PCR fluorescence probe method. And the correlations of them with the clinical characteristics were examined by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The distribution frequencies of PEAR1 rs12041331 and PTGS1 rs10306114 genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and there was no significant difference in the distribution of PEAR1 rs12041331 polymorphism. Compared to the nonrecurrent group, the AA genotype of the PTGS1 polymorphism was more frequent in the recurrent group (59.77% vs 35.29%, P = .003), and the A allele also showed a higher frequency than the G allele in the recurrent group (P = .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that smoking (OR = 5.228, 95% CI: 1.938-14.102, P = .001), coronary heart disease (OR = 4.754, 95% CI: 1.498-15.089, P = .008), and the polymorphism at PTGS1(A>G) AA/AG + GG (OR = 2.955, 95% CI: 1.320-6.616, P = .008) were independently associated with IS recurrence in Chinese patients. Our findings suggested that PTGS rs10306114 polymorphisms should receive more attention in the use of aspirin in patients with IS.
INTRODUCTION: There is a high degree of inter-individual variability among people in response to intervention with omega-3 fatty acids (FA), which may partly explain conflicting results on the effectiveness of omega-3 FA for the treatment and prevention of chronic inflammatory diseases. In this study we sought to evaluate whether part of this inter-individual variability in response is related to the regulation of key oxylipin metabolic genes in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: Plasma FA and oxylipin profiles from 12 healthy individuals were compared to PBMC gene expression profiles following six weeks of supplementation with fish oil, which delivered 1.9 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1.5 g/d docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fold changes in gene expression were measured by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Healthy individuals supplemented with omega-3 FA had differential responses in prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) gene expression in isolated PBMCs. In those individuals for whom plasma arachidonic acid (ARA) in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid class decreased in response to omega-3 intervention, there was a corresponding decrease in gene expression for PTGS1 and ALOX12. Several oxylipin product/FA precursor ratios (e.g. prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/ARA for PTGS1 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE)/ARA for ALOX12) were also associated with fold change in gene expression, suggesting an association between enzyme activity and gene expression. The fold-change in PTGS1 gene expression was highly positively correlated with ALOX12 gene expression but not with PTGS2, whereas IL-8 and PTGS2 were positively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of important oxylipin metabolic genes in PBMCs varied with the extent of change in ARA concentrations in the case of PTGS1 and ALOX12 regulation. PBMC gene expression changes in response to omega-3 supplementation varied among healthy individuals, and were associated with changes in plasma FA and oxylipin composition to different degrees in different individuals.

PURPOSE: Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 1 (PTGS1) and smoking may play important roles in aspirin nonresponsiveness, but the effect of their interaction on stroke outcomes remains largely unknown. We examined the effects of PTGS1 polymorphisms, smoking status, and their interaction on functional outcomes in a cohort of Chinese Han patients with stroke during aspirin therapy. METHODS: A total of 617 ischemic stroke patients taking aspirin were enrolled. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1330344, rs3842788, and rs5788 in PTGS1 were determined for genotyping. Poor functional outcomes were defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 3-6 at 90-day follow-up. The influence of PTGS1 gene-smoking interaction on functional outcomes was examined. RESULTS: Poor functional outcomes occurred in 145 (23.5%) patients. When adjusting multiple factors by logistic regression, CC genotype of rs1330344 was associated with poor functional outcomes (risk ratio [RR]=1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.37). A similar connection was found in the CGC haplotype (RR=1.40; 95% CI: 1.08-1.77). Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between rs1330344 and smoking status (P(interaction)=0.018); the interaction effect between the PTGS1 haplotype and smoking also showed statistical significance (P(interaction)=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese Han stroke patients with aspirin therapy, the adverse effect of PTGS1 polymorphisms on functional outcomes may be modulated by the smoking status. PTGS1 gene-smoking interaction might in part reflect the heterogeneity in the prognosis of patients treated with aspirin.
We have identified a rare missense variant on chromosome 9, position 125145990 (GRCh37), in exon 8 in PTGS1 (the gene encoding cyclo-oxygenase 1, COX-1, the target of anti-thrombotic aspirin therapy). We report that in the homozygous state within a large consanguineous family this variant is associated with a bleeding phenotype and alterations in platelet reactivity and eicosanoid production. Western blotting and confocal imaging demonstrated that COX-1 was absent in the platelets of three family members homozygous for the PTGS1 variant but present in their leukocytes. Platelet reactivity, as assessed by aggregometry, lumi-aggregometry and flow cytometry, was impaired in homozygous family members, as were platelet adhesion and spreading. The productions of COX-derived eicosanoids by stimulated platelets were greatly reduced but there were no changes in the levels of urinary metabolites of COX-derived eicosanoids. The proband exhibited additional defects in platelet aggregation and spreading which may explain why her bleeding phenotype was slightly more severe than those of other homozygous affected relatives. This is the first demonstration in humans of the specific loss of platelet COX-1 activity and provides insight into its consequences for platelet function and eicosanoid metabolism. Notably despite the absence of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) formation by platelets, urinary TXA2 metabolites were in the normal range indicating these cannot be assumed as markers of in vivo platelet function. Results from this study are important benchmarks for the effects of aspirin upon platelet COX-1, platelet function and eicosanoid production as they define selective platelet COX-1 ablation within humans.
