Cytochrome P450 2C19; A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates PUFA specifically at the omega-1 position. Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA. Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limo [...] 
Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; i.e., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (i.e., desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, and venlafaxine), and serotonin modulators with SSRI-like properties (i.e., vilazodone and vortioxetine) are primary pharmacologic treatments for major depressive and anxiety disorders. Genetic variation in CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 influences the metabolism of many of these antidepressants, which may potentially affect dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. In addition, the pharmacodynamic genes SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) and HTR2A (serotonin-2A receptor) have been examined in relation to efficacy and side effect profiles of these drugs. This guideline updates and expands the 2015 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and SSRI dosing and summarizes the impact of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, SLC6A4, and HTR2A genotypes on antidepressant dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. We provide recommendations for using CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 genotype results to help inform prescribing these antidepressants and describe the existing data for SLC6A4 and HTR2A, which do not support their clinical use in antidepressant prescribing.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are primary treatment options for major depressive and anxiety disorders. CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms can influence the metabolism of SSRIs, thereby affecting drug efficacy and safety. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting these associations and provide dosing recommendations for fluvoxamine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline based on CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19 genotype (updates at www.pharmgkb.org).

AIM: We investigated the interaction of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotype on clinical outcome in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: A cohort of 306 patients on tamoxifen treatment for a minimum of 1 year were employed to analyze the effect of genotype-predicted phenotype on relapse-free survival. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: We show that the group with worst outcome and highest risk of relapse is that of 2C19 upward arrow-2D6 downward arrow (hazard ratio: 2.94), when adjusting for age, Nottingham prognostic index and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, the effect of 2C19 upward arrow-2D6 downward arrowgenotype-predicted phenotype is greatly enhanced in premenopausal patients (hazard ratio: 21.08). We hypothesize that poor bioactivation of tamoxifen in patients with low CYP2D6 activity and high CYP2C19 metabolism represents a tamoxifen-treated patient group that has the worst clinical outcome.
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are important drug metabolizing enzymes and together metabolize about 18% of currently available drugs. Some of the important groups of drugs that are metabolized by them are antihypertensives, hypoglycemics, anticonvulsants, antiulcer drugs etc. Genes encoding these enzymes are polymorphically expressed. Thirty variant alleles for CYP2C9 and 21 for CYP2C19 have been reported. The frequencies of these polymorphic alleles show marked inter-ethnic variation. Several reports have been published showing the clinical importance of this polymorphism. This review summarizes the currently available important information on this topic.
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine (BZD) used worldwide for a variety of conditions. Long-term use of diazepam increases the risk for developing tolerance and dependence and for the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mainly metabolize diazepam and are therefore the primary pharmacogenetic candidate biomarkers. In this work, we aimed to explore the impact of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 phenotypes and of 99 additional variants in other 31 pharmacogenes (including other CYP, UGT, NAT2 and CES enzymes, ABC and SLC transporters) on diazepam pharmacokinetic variability and safety. 30 healthy volunteers that had participated in a single-dose bioequivalence clinical trial of two diazepam formulations were enrolled in the present candidate gene pharmacogenetic study. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) showed an almost 2-fold increase in AUC(0-infinity/)DW compared to rapid (RMs) or normal (NM) metabolizers, and a 1.46-fold increase compared to intermediate metabolizers (IMs). CYP2B6 PMs showed a 2,74-fold higher AUC(0-infinity)/DW compared to RMs, and 2.10-fold compared to NMs (p < 0.007). A dose reduction of 25-50 % may be appropriate for CYP2C19 or CYP2B6 PMs to avoid ADRs, dependence and tolerance. Combined CYP2C19 +CYP2B6 PMs may not use diazepam or sharper dose adjustments (e.g., a dose reduction of 50-70 %) may be advisable. To our knowledge, this is the first work to report a strong relationship between CYP2B6 phenotype and diazepam pharmacokinetics. Additional nominal associations (i.e., 0.007 <p < 0.05) between ABCG2, ABCB1, NAT2 and UGT1A4 polymorphisms and pharmacokinetic variability were observed; further research should elaborate on the clinical relevance of the described associations.
CYP2C19 catalyzes the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel, and CYP2C19 genotype impacts clopidogrel active metabolite formation. CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizers who receive clopidogrel experience reduced platelet inhibition and increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. This guideline is an update to the 2013 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for the use of clopidogrel based on CYP2C19 genotype and includes expanded indications for CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy, increased strength of recommendation for CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers, updated CYP2C19 genotype to phenotype translation, and evidence from an expanded literature review (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).
Voriconazole is the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of fungal infections. While there is a good correlation between CYP2C19 genotype and voriconazole exposure during prophylactic treatment, no correlation was found in patients with invasive aspergillosis. Proinflammatory cytokines result in inhibition of CYP2C19 enzyme activity (and may result in phenoconversion). Here we investigated the relationship between inflammation, CYP2C19 genotype-predicted-phenotype, and CYP2C19 activity in patients receiving voriconazole. Data were obtained from two prospective studies investigating voriconazole treatment (NCT02074462 and NCT00893555). Dose-corrected voriconazole plasma concentration and C-reactive protein (CRP) were used as proxies for CYP2C19 activity and inflammation, respectively. After data extraction and synthesis, data from 39 patients with paired voriconazole and CRP measurements were available. The distribution of CYP2C19 genotype-predicted metabolizer phenotypes was 31% intermediate (IM), 41% normal (NM), and 28% rapid metabolizer (RM). During inflammation, dose-corrected voriconazole levels were increased by 245%, 278%, and 486% for CYP2C19 NMs IMs and RMs, respectively. Patients with moderate or high CRP levels (>50 mg/L) were phenoconverted to a lower metabolizer phenotype irrespective of their CYP2C19 genotype. In a subgroup analysis of eight patients with longitudinal data available with and without inflammation, the pattern of the dose-corrected voriconazole and CRP measurements were similar, with CYP2C19 activity following decreasing or increasing CRP levels. In conclusion, voriconazole plasma concentrations increase during inflammation due to downregulation of CYP2C19 activity. While this effect appears largest for CYP2C19 RMs, no clinically relevant differences were observed between the CYP2C19 genotypes.
Variability in hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as 2C19 and 2D6 may influence side-effect and efficacy outcomes for antipsychotics. Aripiprazole and risperidone are two commonly prescribed antipsychotics, metabolized primarily through CYP2D6. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the effect of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 on side-effects of aripiprazole and risperidone, and expand on existing literature by critically examining methodological issues associated with pharmacogenetic studies. A PRISMA compliant search of six electronic databases (Pubmed, PsychInfo, Embase, Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) identified pharmacogenetic studies on aripiprazole and risperidone. 2007 publications were first identified, of which 34 were included. Quality of literature was estimated using Newcastle-Ottowa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The average NOS score was 5.8 (range: 3-8) for risperidone literature and 5 for aripiprazole (range: 4-6). All RCTs on aripiprazole were rated as high risk of bias, and four out of six for risperidone literature. Study populations ranged from healthy volunteers to inpatient individuals in psychiatric units and included adult and pediatric samples. All n = 34 studies examined CYP2D6. Only one study genotyped for CYP2C19 and found a positive association with neurological side-effects of risperidone. Most studies did not report any relationship between CYP2D6 and any side-effect outcome. Heterogeneity between and within studies limited the ability to synthesize data and draw definitive conclusions. Studies lacked statistical power due to small sample size, selective genotyping methods, and study design. Large-scale randomized trials with multiple measurements, providing robust evidence on this topic, are suggested.
The present study aimed to clarify the expressions and roles of clock genes involved in drug metabolism in patients taking benzodiazepines (BZDs), as well as the drug metabolism regulators controlled by clock genes for each BZD type. The relationships between the expressions of the clock genes BMAL1, PER2, and DBP and the drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 were investigated using livers from BZD-detected autopsy cases. In addition, the effect of BZD exposure on various genes was examined in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The expressions of DBP, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 in the liver were lower in the diazepam-detected group than in the non-detected group. Furthermore, BMAL1 expression correlated with CYP2C19 expression. Cell culture experiments showed that the expressions of DBP and CYP3A4 decreased, whereas those of BMAL1 and CYP2C19 increased after diazepam and midazolam exposure. The results of the analyses of autopsy samples and cultured cells suggested that DBP regulates CYP3A4 when exposed to BZD. Understanding the relationship between these clock genes and CYPs may help achieve individualized drug therapy.
Treatment non-response and adverse reactions are common in patients receiving antidepressants. Personalizing psychiatric treatment based on pharmacogenetic testing has been proposed to help clinicians guide antidepressant selection and dosing. This systematic literature review assesses the two most robustly studied drug-metabolizing enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, and examines whether obtaining CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 testing can be used to predict antidepressant response or adverse drug reactions in order to improve clinical outcomes. In general, literature reviews published prior to 2013 indicated that results have been inconsistent linking CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to antidepressant treatment outcomes, suggesting that more evidence is required to support the clinical implementation of genotyping to predict outcomes. We thus performed an extensive and systematic literature review, focusing on studies published from 2013 through 2018. Sixteen studies were found to be relevant. The results yielded inconsistent findings, suggesting that CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 testing may predict response in certain individuals, but it remains unclear if this will translate to improved clinical outcomes. Further research is required to determine when pharmacogenetic testing should be utilized and in which populations it is indicated. Randomized, controlled, prospective trials with adequate sample sizes would best clarify whether genotype-guided antidepressant selection will ultimately improve clinical outcomes.
The metabolites of tebufenozide, a model compound, formed by the yeast-expressed human CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 were identified to clarify the substrate recognition mechanism of the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. We then determined whether tebufenozide metabolites may be predicted in silico. Hydrogen abstraction energies were calculated with the density functional theory method B3LYP/6-31G( *). A docking simulation was performed using FRED software. Several alkyl sites of tebufenozide were hydroxylated by CYP3A4 whereas only one site was modified by CYP2C19. The accessibility of each site of tebufenozide to the reaction center of CYP enzymes and the susceptibility of each hydrogen atom for metabolism by CYP enzymes were evaluated by a docking simulation and hydrogen abstraction energy estimation, respectively.
BACKGROUND: Voriconazole pharmacokinetics (PK) are known to be affected by genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2C19; however, such information is limited for the pediatric population. The primary aim of this study is to establish a voriconazole PK model incorporating CYP2C19 phenotypes in Japanese children with malignancy or inborn errors of immunity. METHODS: CYP2C19 genotypes were assessed by whole-genome genotyping and defined as follows: *17/*17: ultrarapid metabolizer (URM), *1/*17: rapid metabolizer (RM), *1/*1:normal metabolizer (NM), *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*17:intermediate metabolizer (IM), and *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3: poor metabolizer (PM). Population PK analysis was performed. The voriconazole serum concentration profile was described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption, mixed linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination. RESULTS: Voriconazole concentration data were available from 60 patients with a median age of 5.3 years. The phenotypes predicted from CYP2C19 genotypes were RM in 1 (2 %), NM in 21 (35 %) patients, IM in 27 (45 %) patients, and PM in 11 (18 %) patients. Underlying diseases included 38 (63%) patients with hematological malignancy and 18 (30 %) patients with inborn errors of immunity. Among the CYP2C19 phenotypes, PM was predicted to show complete inhibition (the degree of V(max) inhibition [V(max, inh)] = 100 %; V(max) = 0). The estimated parameters of V(max,inh) were +0.8 higher in patients with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) Grade 2 or higher and +2.7 higher when C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 2.0 mg/dL or higher. CONCLUSION: CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms, gamma-GTP, and CRP affect V(max,inh) of voriconazole in children with malignancy or inborn errors of immunity.
BACKGROUND: In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a major drawback in coronary stenting. The association between the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) gene and the prevalence of ISR after coronary stenting remains controversial. Previous studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by their small population sizes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between the presence of the CYP2C19 LOF gene and the prevalence of ISR. METHODS: A systematic online database search was performed until April 2021. The primary outcome was ISR and assessed using OR with 95% CI. Quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. I (2) was applied to examine heterogeneities among the studies. RESULTS: A total of 284 patients (four non-randomized controlled trial studies) were included in this study. Two hundred and six patients had wild-type genotypes, while 78 patients had the LOF genotype. Among the 78 patients with the LOF gene, 38 patients had an ISR. Meanwhile, of the 206 patients with a wild-type gene, 69 patients had an ISR. LOF gene was associated with a higher risk of ISR (OR 95% CI = 2.71 [1.42-5.16], P = 0.003). However, study-specific variability should be considered when applying these findings clinically. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LOF genes, regardless of the allele variation, treated with clopidogrel, had a higher likelihood of ISR after coronary stenting.
Tolperisone, a muscle relaxant used for post-stroke spasticity, is metabolized to its main metabolite by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP1A2. We investigated the effects of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms and cigarette smoking on tolperisone pharmacokinetics. A 150 mg oral dose of tolperisone was given to 184 healthy Korean subjects and plasma concentrations of tolperisone were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A 3.14-fold significant increase in AUC(0-infinity) was observed in the CYP2D6*10/*10 group compared with the CYP2D6*wt/*wt group, whereas a 3.59-fold increase in AUC(0-infinity) was observed in CYP2C19PMs compared to CYP2C19EMs. Smokers had a 38.5% decrease in AUC(0-infinity) when compared to non-smokers. When these effects were combined, CYP2D6*10/*10-CYP2C19PM-Non-smokers had a 25.9-fold increase in AUC(0-infinity) compared to CYP2D6*wt/*wt-CYP2C19EM-Smokers. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and cigarette smoking independently and significantly affected tolperisone pharmacokinetics and these effects combined resulted in a much greater impact on tolperisone pharmacokinetics.
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of solid and haematological malignancies and as an immunosuppressive agent. As a prodrug, it is dependent on bioactivation to the active phosphoramide mustard metabolite to elicit its therapeutic effect. This focused review will highlight the evidence for the role of germline pharmacogenetic variation in both plasma pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. There is a substantial indication from 13 pharmacokinetic and 17 therapeutic outcome studies, in contexts as diverse as haematological malignancy, breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus and myeloablation, that pharmacogenetic variation in both CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 influence the bioactivation of cyclophosphamide. An additional role for pharmacogenetic variation in ALDH1A1 has also been reported. Future studies should comprehensively assess these 3 pharmacogenes and undertake appropriate statistical analysis of gene-gene interactions to confirm these findings and may allow personalised treatment regimens.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between CYP2C19 and ABCB1 polymorphisms and clopidogrel resistance (CR) in patients with cardiovascular disease in Beijing district. METHODS: In total, 325 patients were enrolled in the study, including 101 experimental group patients and 224 control group patients. The experimental group was divided into CR group (n=30) and non-CR group (n=71) according to the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet inhibition rate in thromboelastography (TEG) (ADP-induced platelet inhibition rate of <30% was defined as CR and rate of 30%-100% was defined as non-CR). Genotypes, including CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C19*4, CYP2C19*5, CYP2C19*17, and ABCB1, were determined using time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Clin-TOF) and Sanger sequencing in all patients. RESULTS: In the experimental group, carriers of CYP2C19 heterozygous (*1/*2, n=46; *1/*3, n=7), and mutation homozygous (*2/*2, n=7; *2/*3, n=3; *3/*3, n=0) genotypes showed significantly lower ADP-induced platelet inhibition rates than noncarriers (*1/*1, n=38; p=0.035 and 0.001, respectively); the carriage of mutant CYP2C19*2 or *3 allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of CR. In contrast, carriers of ABCB1 heterozygous (TC, n=50) showed significantly lower ADP-induced platelet inhibition rates than noncarriers (CC, n=39, p=0.097), and there was no significant correlation between ABCB1 genotypes and higher CR risk. CONCLUSION: The carriage of CYP2C19*2 or *3 mutant allele was significantly associated with attenuated platelet response to clopidogrel and increased CR risk. The carriage of ABCB1 mutant allele was not significantly associated with CR risk.
OBJECTIVES: Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction is frequently reported by individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) on antidepressants, which negatively impacts treatment adherence and efficacy. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic genes encoding cytochrome-P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, and the transmembrane efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (i.e., ABCB1), on treatment-emergent changes in sexual function (SF) and sexual satisfaction (SS) in the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression 1 (CAN-BIND-1) sample. METHODS: A total of 178 adults with MDD received treatment with escitalopram (ESC) from weeks 0-8 (Phase I). At week 8, nonresponders were augmented with aripiprazole (ARI) (i.e., ESC + ARI, n = 91), while responders continued ESC (i.e., ESC-Only, n = 80) from weeks 8-16 (Phase II). SF and SS were evaluated using the sex effects (SexFX) scale at weeks 0, 8, and 16. We assessed the primary outcomes, SF and SS change for weeks 0-8 and 8-16, using repeated measures mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In ESC-Only, CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizer (IM) + poor metabolizers (PMs) showed treatment-related improvements in sexual arousal, a subdomain of SF, from weeks 8-16, relative to CYP2C19 normal metabolizers (NMs) who showed a decline, F(2,54) = 8.00, p < 0.001, q = 0.048. Specifically, CYP2C19 IM + PMs reported less difficulty with having and sustaining vaginal lubrication in females and erection in males, compared to NMs. Furthermore, ESC-Only females with higher concentrations of ESC metabolite, S-desmethylcitalopram (S-DCT), and S-DCT/ESC ratio in serum demonstrated more decline in SF (r = -0.42, p = 0.004, q = 0.034) and SS (r = -0.43, p = 0.003, q = 0.034), respectively, which was not observed in males. ESC-Only females also demonstrated a trend for a correlation between S-DCT and sexual arousal change in the same direction (r = -0.39, p = 0.009, q = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotypes may be influencing changes in sexual arousal related to ESC monotherapy. Thus, preemptive genotyping of CYP2C19 may help to guide selection of treatment that circumvents selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-related sexual dysfunction thereby improving outcomes for patients. Additionally, further research is warranted to clarify the role of S-DCT in the mechanisms underlying ESC-related changes in SF and SS. This CAN-BIND-1 study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01655706) on 27 July 2012.
