Statins reduce cholesterol, prevent cardiovascular disease, and are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the world. Statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS) impact statin adherence and ultimately can impede the long-term effectiveness of statin therapy. There are several identified pharmacogenetic variants that impact statin disposition and adverse events during statin therapy. SLCO1B1 encodes a transporter (SLCO1B1; alternative names include OATP1B1 or OATP-C) that facilitates the hepatic uptake of all statins. ABCG2 encodes an efflux transporter (BCRP) that modulates the absorption and disposition of rosuvastatin. CYP2C9 encodes a phase I drug metabolizing enzyme responsible for the oxidation of some statins. Genetic variation in each of these genes alters systemic exposure to statins (i.e., simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin), which can increase the risk for SAMS. We summarize the literature supporting these associations and provide therapeutic recommendations for statins based on SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotype with the goal of improving the overall safety, adherence, and effectiveness of statin therapy. This document replaces the 2012 and 2014 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy.
BACKGROUND: Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statin therapy results in substantial reductions in cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in cholesterol may produce larger benefits. In rare cases, myopathy occurs in association with statin therapy, especially when the statins are administered at higher doses and with certain other medications. METHODS: We carried out a genomewide association study using approximately 300,000 markers (and additional fine-mapping) in 85 subjects with definite or incipient myopathy and 90 controls, all of whom were taking 80 mg of simvastatin daily as part of a trial involving 12,000 participants. Replication was tested in a trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily involving 20,000 participants. RESULTS: The genomewide scan yielded a single strong association of myopathy with the rs4363657 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within SLCO1B1 on chromosome 12 (P=4x10(-9)). SLCO1B1 encodes the organic anion-transporting polypeptide OATP1B1, which has been shown to regulate the hepatic uptake of statins. The noncoding rs4363657 SNP was in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with the nonsynonymous rs4149056 SNP (r(2)=0.97), which has been linked to statin metabolism. The prevalence of the rs4149056 C allele in the population was 15%. The odds ratio for myopathy was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 7.7) per copy of the C allele, and 16.9 (95% CI, 4.7 to 61.1) in CC as compared with TT homozygotes. More than 60% of these myopathy cases could be attributed to the C variant. The association of rs4149056 with myopathy was replicated in the trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily, which also showed an association between rs4149056 and the cholesterol-lowering effects of simvastatin. No SNPs in any other region were clearly associated with myopathy. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified common variants in SLCO1B1 that are strongly associated with an increased risk of statin-induced myopathy. Genotyping these variants may help to achieve the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN74348595.)
The Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar) is now providing star (*) allele nomenclature for the highly polymorphic human SLCO1B1 gene encoding the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) drug transporter. Genetic variation within the SLCO1B1 gene locus impacts drug transport, which can lead to altered pharmacokinetic profiles of several commonly prescribed drugs. Variable OATP1B1 function is of particular importance regarding hepatic uptake of statins and the risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms. To introduce this important drug transporter gene into the PharmVar database and serve as a unified reference of haplotype variation moving forward, an international group of gene experts has performed an extensive review of all published SLCO1B1 star alleles. Previously published star alleles were self-assigned by authors and only loosely followed the star nomenclature system that was first developed for cytochrome P450 genes. This nomenclature system has been standardized by PharmVar and is now applied to other important pharmacogenes such as SLCO1B1. In addition, data from the 1000 Genomes Project and investigator-submitted data were utilized to confirm existing haplotypes, fill knowledge gaps, and/or define novel star alleles. The PharmVar-developed SLCO1B1 nomenclature has been incorporated by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) 2022 guideline on statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms.
There is a great deal of interest in understanding genes that predict drug response. In January, South Dakota Medicine began publishing a series of monthly articles dedicated to reviewing the pros and cons of gene-based drug dosing. The first article in this series was a point-counterpoint argument by local content experts exploring the utility of CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 gene, subfamily 2C19) genotyping for patients taking clopidogrel. The second article explored genotype-guided warfarin therapy. We now present the third article in this series, a discussion of the genes that impact patient risk for myopathy on statins.
A variety of carcinogens are excreted in urine and may be actively transported by organic anion-transporting polypeptides that encoded by SLCOs. In this study, we evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1, and SLCO1B3 are associated with bladder cancer susceptibility. Our results, for the first time, indicated that polymorphisms of SLCO1B1 rs2306283 might be associated with bladder cancer risk. Therefore, SNPs in SLCO1B1 may be potential biomarkers for assessing the risk of bladder cancer.
Background: SLCO1B1 variants are known to be a strong predictor of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) risk with simvastatin. Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review on 20,341 patients who had SLCO1B1 genotyping to quantify the uptake of clinical decision support (CDS) for genetic variants known to impact SAMS risk. Results: A total of 182 patients had 417 CDS alerts generated, and 150 of these patients (82.4%) received pharmacotherapy that did not increase risks for SAMS. Providers were more likely to cancel simvastatin orders in response to CDS alerts if genotyping had been done prior to the first simvastatin prescription than after (94.1% vs 28.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusion: CDS significantly reduces simvastatin prescribing at doses associated with SAMS.
BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze the polymorphism of APOE and SLCO1B1 genotype and correlation with blood lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia in Hunan Province, China. METHODS: Concentration of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were retrospectively analyzed from 396 patients with dyslipidemia from 2016 to 2020. The APOE and SLCO1B1 genotypes were detected by PCR-fluorescent probe. SPSS21.0 software was used to analyze the gene frequency and their correlation. RESULTS: The frequency of E3/E3 genotype was the highest in the APOE gene, reaching 64.14%. The concentrations of LDL-C and TC in E4 phenotype group were the highest and were statistically different from those in E2 and E3 phenotype groups (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in E4 phenotype between the dyslipidemia group and the normolipidemia group (p < 0.05). The frequency of *1b/*1b genotype was the highest in the SLCO1B1 gene, reaching 41.41%. The concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the intermediate OA1P1B1 function group were higher than those in the normal OA1P1B1 function group and the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The genotypes of APOE and SLCO1B1 gene are correlated with concentration of TC and LDL-C, and their genotypes frequency distribution have regional differences.
Hyperbilirubinemia is the main mechanism that causes neonatal jaundice, and genetics is one of the risk factors of hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, this study aims to explore the correlation between two genes, UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1, and hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates. One hundred thirty seven neonates were recruited from Division of Clinical Chemistry, Ramathibodi Hospital. UGT1A1*28 and *6 were determined by pyrosequencing whereas, SLCO1B1 388A > G and 521 T > C genetic variants were determined by TaqMan(R) real-time polymerase chain reaction. Neonates carrying with homozygous (AA) and heterozygous (GA) variants in UGT1A1*6 were significantly related to hyperbilirubinemia development compared with wild type (GG; P < 0.001). To the combined of UGT1A1, total bilirubin levels in homozygous variant were higher significantly than heterozygous variant and wild type (P = 0.002, P = 0.003, respectively). Moreover, SLCO1B1 combination was significant differences between the hyperbilirubinemia and the control group (P = 0.041). SLCO1B1 521 T > C variant provide protection for Thai neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (P = 0.041). There are no significant differences in UGT1A1*28 and SLCO1B1 388A > G for the different severity of hyperbilirubinemia. The combined UGT1A1*28 and *6 polymorphism is a strong risk factor for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates. Therefore, we suggest neonates with this gene should be closely observed to avoid higher severities of bilirubin.
The effect of genetic polymorphism of human organic anion transporting polypeptide C (OATP-C) on the lipid-lowering response to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors was assessed. A retrospective study was conducted on 66 patients who underwent treatment of hyperlipidemia with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in a municipal hospital in a community-based cohort of Ehime prefecture in the southern part of Japan. Plasma lipid concentrations before and after administration were analyzed in patients in relation to the 521T/C (Val-174-->Ala) polymorphism in the OATP-C gene (TT: n=44 (66.7%), TC: n=20 (30.3%), CC: n=0 (0.0%), undetermined: n=2 (3.0%)). Total cholesterol level was significantly lowered after treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in all patients (p<0.001); moreover, subjects with the 521C allele showed an attenuated total-cholesterol-lowering effect compared with those homozygous for the 521T allele (-22.3+/-8.7% vs. -16.5+/-10.5%, p<0.05). These data suggest that the 521T/C polymorphism of the OATP-C gene modulates the lipid-lowering efficacy of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
AIM: To determine whether the SNP rs4149056 in SLCO1B1 alters the pharmacodynamics of pravastatin. METHODS: rs4149056 was genotyped in 626 pravastatin-treated participants in the WOSCOPS trial and the response after 1 year of treatment was compared between the different genotypes. RESULTS: Pravastatin reduced serum LDL cholesterol by 22.2% in TT homozygotes, by 22.2% in TC heterozygotes and by 17.7% in CC homozygotes (TT + TC vs. CC P value 0.33). There were no significant differences in the response of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides or CRP to pravastatin between the genotypes. CONCLUSION: The rs4149056 SNP did not significantly affect the pharmacodynamics of pravastatin.
We have recently found that the frequency of OATP-C*15 is significantly higher in patients who experienced myopathy after receiving pravastatin or atorvastatin than in patients without myopathy. However, there were two patients who experienced pravastatin-induced myopathy despite the fact that they did not possess OATP-C*15 or other known mutations of OATP-C that have been reported to decrease the function of OATP-C. In this study, we sequenced all of the exons and exon-intron junctions of OATP-C of the two patients and found a novel mutation in exon 12 of OATP-C in one of the patients. In this mutation (1628T>G), there is a substitution of Leu to Trp at position 543 in transmembrane-spanning domain 10 of OATP-C. However, the frequency of this mutation in the Japanese population appears to be very low (<1%).
Rotor syndrome is a rare, benign, inherited disorder that is commonly associated with mild hyperbilirubinemia. It is caused by bi-allelic pathological variants in both SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes, causing defective OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in the sinusoidal membrane and interrupted bilirubin uptake of the hepatocytes. We report five Taiwanese pediatric and adult patients aged 5-32 years presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and were found to have genetic variants of SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. Two also had history of prolonged neonatal jaundice. Genetic analysis using panel-based next generation sequencing revealed three patients with homozygous mutations c.1738C>T (p.R580 *) in SLCO1B1 and a transposon LINE-1 insertion in SLCO1B3, one patient with homozygous mutations for another haplotype, c.757C>T (p.R253 *) in SLCO1B1 and c.1747+1G>A in SLCO1B3. Another patient had heterozygous c.1738C>T (p.R580 *) in SLCO1B1 linked with a LINE-1 insertion in SLCO1B3, and heterozygous c.757C>T (p.R253 *) in SLCO1B1 linked with c.1747+1G>A in SLCO1B3. In conclusion, we present the first time of genetic diagnosis of Rotor syndrome in Taiwan. Advanced genetic testing has enhanced the diagnosis of rare diseases with mild symptoms.
Reports on the association between the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) T521C polymorphism and methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity in patients with malignancies are inconsistent. This meta-analysis evaluated the association between the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism and methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. We performed a systematic review of previous reports from the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to evaluate the effect of the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism on the occurrence of methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. In total, data from five studies including 465 patients were analyzed. Patients had received a high-dose methotrexate regimen (1-5 g/m2). The SLCO1B1 variant allele (C allele) carriers had a 1.9-fold higher risk of hepatotoxicity than wild-type homozygote carriers (TT; OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.14-3.31). This meta-analysis demonstrated that C allele carriers of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than patients with the TT genotype. The SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism may be a useful predictor for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity in patients with malignancies.
Aim: The aim of this study was to identify pharmacogenomic biomarkers to predict tegafur-uracil (UFT)-induced liver dysfunction. Patients & methods: A total of 68 patients, who were administered UFT, were evaluated using a two-step pharmacogenomics analysis. Results: The first screening revealed the association between five SNPs and UFT-induced hepatic dysfunction. In the second step, SLCO1B1 (rs4149056) was found to be the only SNP associated with UFT treatment-related elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (odds ratio: C/C vs T/T = 7.8, C/T vs T/T = 5.7; p = 0.037) and alanine transaminase (odds ratio: C/C vs T/T = 12.2, C/T vs T/T = 4.1; p = 0.034) levels. Conclusion: The SLCO1B1 polymorphisms are possible predictors of UFT treatment-related hepatic dysfunction.
We report a case of an adult woman of African ancestry who was hospitalized with statin induced- rhabdomyolysis. The patient presented to the emergency room with a 2-week history of worsening muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and low oral intake, 1 month after starting 40 mg daily dose of rosuvastatin. Sequencing of SLCO1B1 coding regions revealed the patient was heterozygous for two SLCO1B1 deleterious variants, c.481+1G>T and c.1463G>C (*9), which are more prevalent in patients of African ancestry. This highlights the importance of pharmacogenetic testing in SLCO1B1, which includes a broader range of genetic variants for patients of African ancestry.
The solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) encodes the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1 protein) that transports statins to liver cells. Common genetic variants in SLCO1B1, such as *5, cause altered systemic exposure to statins and therefore affect statin outcomes, with potential pharmacogenetic applications; yet, evidence is inconclusive. We studied common and rare SLCO1B1 variants in up to 64,000 patients from UK Biobank prescribed simvastatin or atorvastatin, combining whole-exome sequencing data with up to 25-year routine clinical records. We studied 51 predicted gain/loss-of-function variants affecting OATP1B1. Both SLCO1B1*5 alone and the SLCO1B1*15 haplotype increased LDL during treatment (beta*5 = 0.08 mmol/L, p = 6 x 10(-8); beta*15 = 0.03 mmol/L, p = 3 x 10(-4)), as did the likelihood of discontinuing statin prescriptions (hazard ratio*5 = 1.12, p = 0.04; HR*15 = 1.05, p = 0.04). SLCO1B1*15 and SLCO1B1*20 increased the risk of General Practice (GP)-diagnosed muscle symptoms (HR*15 = 1.22, p = 0.003; HR*20 = 1.25, p = 0.01). We estimated that genotype-guided prescribing could potentially prevent 18% and 10% of GP-diagnosed muscle symptoms experienced by statin patients, with *15 and *20, respectively. The remaining common variants were not individually significant. Rare variants in SLCO1B1 increased LDL in statin users by up to 1.05 mmol/L, but replication is needed. We conclude that genotype-guided treatment could reduce GP-diagnosed muscle symptoms in statin patients; incorporating further SLCO1B1 variants into clinical prediction scores could improve LDL control and decrease adverse events, including discontinuation.
BACKGROUND: Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2, ABCG2, are important transporters involved in the transport of endogenous substrates and xenobiotics, including drugs. Genetic polymorphisms of these transporters have effect on transporter activity. There is significant interethnic variability in the frequency of allele variants. AIM: To determined allele and genotype frequencies of ABCG2 and SLCO1B1 genes in Croatian populations of European descent. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 905 subjects (482 women) were included. Genotyping for ABCG2 c.421C > A (rs2231142) and for SLCO1B1 c.521T > C (rs4149056), was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TaqMan((R)) DME Genotyping Assays. RESULTS: For ABCG2 c.421C > A, the frequency of CC, CA and AA genotypes was 81.4%, 17.8% and 0.8% respectively. The frequency of variant ABCG2 421 A allele was 9.7%. For SLCO1B1 c.521T > C, the frequency of TT, TC and CC genotypes was 61.7%, 34.8% and 3.5% respectively. The frequency of variant SLCO1B1 521 C allele was 20.9%. CONCLUSION: The frequency of the ABCG2 and SLCO1B1 allelic variants and genotypes in the Croatian population is in accordance with other European populations. Pharmacogenetic analysis can serve to individualise drug therapy and minimise the risk of developing adverse drug reactions.
OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) is predominantly expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and is critically important for the hepatic uptake and clearance of numerous drug substrates and endogenous compounds. In general, the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP; SLCO) represent a superfamily of uptake transporters that mediate the sodium-independent transport of a diverse range of amphipathic organic compounds including bile salts, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones, anionic peptides, numerous drugs and other xenobiotic substances. OATP1B1 is highly polymorphic and a number of relevant and ethnically dependent polymorphisms have been identified and functionally characterized. In particular, the SLCO1B1 521T>C and 388A>G polymorphisms are commonly occurring variants in ethnically diverse populations and numerous in vitro and clinical studies have evaluated the consequences of these variants to interindividual differences in drug disposition and response. OATP1B1 is particularly important for the disposition of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, as it is known to efficiently transport most statins to their site of action within hepatocytes. Many studies have focused on the consequences of OATP1B1 variants to statin disposition in vitro and in vivo and would suggest that genetic variability in SLCO1B1 has important implications for statin pharmacokinetics, risk for statin-induced myopathy, and modulation of statin treatment response. This review describes what is currently known regarding SLCO1B1 genotype, OATP1B1 protein expression and interindividual and interethnic consequences to drug disposition, with particular focus on statin pharmacokinetics and implications for drug response and toxicity.
Rifabutin, used to treat HIV-infected tuberculosis, shows highly variable drug exposure, complicating dosing. Effects of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on rifabutin pharmacokinetics were investigated in 35 African HIV-infected tuberculosis patients after multiple doses. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling found that influential covariates for the pharmacokinetics were weight, sex, and a 30% increased bioavailability among heterozygous carriers of SLCO1B1 rs1104581 (previously associated with low rifampin concentrations). Larger studies are needed to understand the complex interactions of host genetics in HIV-infected tuberculosis patients. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00640887.).
