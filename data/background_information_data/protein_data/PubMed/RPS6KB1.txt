Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1; Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts downstream of mTOR signaling in response to growth factors and nutrients to promote cell proliferation, cell growth and cell cycle progression. Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD. Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex. Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTO [...] 
A recent genome-wide association study reported five loci for which there was strong, but sub-genome-wide significant evidence for association with multiple sclerosis risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of these potential risk loci in a large and independent data set of  approximately  20,000 subjects. We tested five single nucleotide polymorphisms rs228614 (MANBA), rs630923 (CXCR5), rs2744148 (SOX8), rs180515 (RPS6KB1), and rs6062314 (ZBTB46) for association with multiple sclerosis risk in a total of 8499 cases with multiple sclerosis, 8765 unrelated control subjects and 958 trios of European descent. In addition, we assessed the overall evidence for association by combining these newly generated data with the results from the original genome-wide association study by meta-analysis. All five tested single nucleotide polymorphisms showed consistent and statistically significant evidence for association with multiple sclerosis in our validation data sets (rs228614: odds ratio = 0.91, P = 2.4 x 10(-6); rs630923: odds ratio = 0.89, P = 1.2 x 10(-4); rs2744148: odds ratio = 1.14, P = 1.8 x 10(-6); rs180515: odds ratio = 1.12, P = 5.2 x 10(-7); rs6062314: odds ratio = 0.90, P = 4.3 x 10(-3)). Combining our data with results from the previous genome-wide association study by meta-analysis, the evidence for association was strengthened further, surpassing the threshold for genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in each case. Our study provides compelling evidence that these five loci are genuine multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci. These results may eventually lead to a better understanding of the underlying disease pathophysiology.
BACKGROUND: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive substitute to liver biopsy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) molecular profiling. This study aimed to use cfDNA to investigate copy number variation (CNV) in the BCL9 and RPS6KB1 genes and its impact on prognosis in HCC. METHODS: Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine the CNV and cfDNA integrity index in 100 HCC patients. RESULTS: CNV gain in BCL9 and RPS6KB1 genes was detected in 14% and 24% of patients, respectively. Gain in CNV of BCL9 associated with risk of HCC in alcohol drinkers and hepatitis C seropositivity. In patients with RPS6KB1 gain, HCC risk increased with a high body mass index, smoking, schistosomiasis, and Barcelona clinical liver cancer stage (BCLC) A. Gain in both genes showed a high risk of HCC with elevated liver enzymes, Schistosomiasis, BCLC C, and PS > 1. The integrity of cfDNA was higher in patients with CNV gain in RPS6KB1 than those harboring CNV gain in BCL9. Lastly, BCL9 gain and BCL9 + RPS6KB1 gain led to higher mortality rates and reduced survival times. CONCLUSION: cfDNA was used to detect BCL9 and RPS6KB1 CNVs, which influence prognosis and can be used as independent predictors of HCC patient survival.
Autophagy plays a critical role in cancer, since it can either suppress tumorigenesis by inhibiting cancer cell survival, or facilitate tumorigenesis by promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. However, the role of genetic variants of autophagy-regulated key genes for bladder cancer risk remained unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the association of bladder cancer with genetic variants on genes involved in autophagy pathway. Gene-based analysis was performed with multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) in 580 bladder cancer cases and 1101 controls. The logistic regression model was used to calculate the SNP effects on bladder cancer susceptibility. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was conducted by the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) project. Gene expression was evaluated based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Three potentially functional SNPs RPS6KB1 rs1292038, PIK3R1 rs34303, and rs56352616 were demonstrated to be associated with risk of bladder cancer (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61-0.82, P = 7.88 x 10(-6) for rs1292038; OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.09-1.45, P = 2.11 x 10(-3) for rs34303; OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.90, P = 2.47 x 10(-3) for rs56352616). An increasing number of risk genotypes of these three SNPs were associated with a higher risk of developing bladder cancer. Besides, rs1292038 exhibited an eQTL effect for RPS6KB1 in whole blood (P = 3.90 x 10(-7)). Furthermore, the higher expression of RPS6KB1 and lower expression of PIK3R1 were both significantly associated with bladder cancer risk. Our findings indicated that genetic variants in autophagy pathway genes RPS6KB1 and PIK3R1 confer bladder cancer susceptibility.
Human esophagus carcinoma (EC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, especially in Africa and Asia including China. In EC initiation and progression, genetic and epigenetic aberrations have been reported to play a major role, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, the miR-30e levels were analyzed in human EC tissues and TCGA databases, and the results demonstrated that miR-30e expression in EC tissues was significantly decreased compared to adjacent normal tissues. To further investigate the role of miR-30e in cancer cells, we found that forced expression of miR-30e dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, tube formation, and colony formation of cancer cells. To determine the underlying mechanism of miR-30e, we found that RPS6KB1 was a direct target of miR-30e by binding to its 3'-UTR, which was verified by luciferase activity assay using reporters with wild-type miR-30e and its seed sequence mutant constructs and Western blotting assay. In vivo experiment showed that miR-30e overexpression significantly inhibited tumor growth and decreased RPS6KB1 expression in xenografts. In EC, high expression of RPS6KB1 in tumor tissues indicated poor prognosis of patients with less survival rate. High levels of RPS6KB1 and low levels of miR-30e closely correlated poor survival of patients with several other types of cancer. These findings show that miR-30e and its target RPS6KB1 are important in cancer development and clinical outcomes, and miR-30e/RPS6KB1 is a potential future therapeutic pathway for EC intervention.
RPS6KB1 is the kinase of ribosomal protein S6 which is 70 kDa and is required for protein translation. Although the abnormal activation of RPS6KB1 has been found in types of diseases, its role and clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been fully investigated. In this study, we identified that RPS6KB1 was over-phosphorylated (p-RPS6KB1) in NSCLC and it was an independent unfavorable prognostic marker for NSCLC patients. In spite of the frequent expression of total RPS6KB1 and p-RPS6KB1 in NSCLC specimens by immunohistochemical staining (IHC), only p-RPS6KB1 was associated with the clinicopathologic characteristics of NSCLC subjects. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the increased expression of p-RPS6KB1 indicated a poorer 5-year overall survival (OS) for NSCLC patients, while the difference between the positive or negative RPS6KB1 group was not significant. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was then used to confirm the independent prognostic value of p-RPS6KB1. To illustrate the underlying mechanism of RPS6KB1 phosphorylation in NSCLC, LY2584702 was employed to inhibit the RPS6KB1 phosphorylation specifically both in lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and squamous cell carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1. As expected, RPS6KB1 dephosphorylation remarkably suppressed cells proliferation in CCK-8 test, and promoted more cells arresting in G0-G1 phase by cell cycle analysis. Moreover, apoptotic A549 cells with RPS6KB1 dephosphorylation increased dramatically, with an elevating trend in SK-MES-1, indicating a potential involvement of RPS6KB1 phosphorylation in inducing apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that RPS6KB1 is over-activated as p-RPS6KB1 in NSCLC, rather than just the total protein overexpressing. The phosphorylation level of RPS6KB1 might be used as a novel prognostic marker for NSCLC patients.
RPS6KB1 encodes p70S6K/p85S6K, which plays a role in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathway. CDC2 gene encodes cdc2, which is critical for G2/M cell cycle progression. We had previously shown that amplified RPS6KB1 and CDC2 are commonly detected in the EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in HIV patients. In current study, we further evaluated the amplified RPS6KB1 and CDC2 genes in 12 HIV-related aggressive B-cell lymphomas and 10 non-HIV-related DLBCL using real time quantitative PCR. The cases were divided into 4 groups: 1) HIV-/EBV-; 2) HIV-/EBV+; 3) HIV+/EBV-; and 4) HIV+/EBV+. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the ability of each gene to distinguish non-HIV+/EBV+ cases from HIV+/EBV+ cases. The AUC was estimated to be 0.76 for RPS6KB1 and 0.74 for CDC2 by using the Mann-Whitney statistic. Amplified RPS6KB1 and CDC2 genes were more frequently detected in common variants of DLBCL associated with HIV infection. Taken together, amplified RPS6KB1 and CDC2 are potential biomarkers for the aggressive DLBCL, particularly in HIV+/EBV+ patients. This study also suggests that the HIV+/EBV+ aggressive DLBCL could be potentially treated by targeting RPS6KB1 and CDC2 genes.
RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2, RPS6KB1, RPS6KB2, and PDK1 are involved in several pathways central to the carcinogenic process, including regulation of cell growth, insulin, and inflammation. We evaluated genetic variation in their candidate genes to obtain a better understanding of their association with colon and rectal cancer. We used data from two population-based case-control studies of colon (n=1574 cases, 1940 controls) and rectal (n=791 cases, 999 controls) cancer. We observed genetic variation in RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2, and PRS6KB2 were associated with risk of developing colon cancer while only genetic variation in RPS6KA2 was associated with altering risk of rectal cancer. These genes also interacted significantly with other genes operating in similar mechanisms, including Akt1, FRAP1, NFkappaB1, and PIK3CA. Assessment of tumor markers indicated that these genes and this pathway may importantly contributed to CIMP+ tumors and tumors with KRAS2 mutations. Our findings implicate these candidate genes in the etiology of colon and rectal cancer and provide information on how these genes operate with other genes in the pathway. Our data further suggest that this pathway may lead to CIMP+ and KRAS2-mutated tumors.
RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 1) plays a key role in regulating protein translation. The role of RPS6KB1 in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) has not been fully investigated. This study was undertaken to determine the clinicopathological features and prognostic value of RPS6KB1 in HCC. We examined RPS6KB1 expression in 30 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues by reverse transcription real-time PCR and Western blotting. In addition, we analyzed RPS6KB1 expression in 87 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RPS6KB1 was significantly increased in cancer tissues. Clinicopathological analysis showed that the expression of RPS6KB1 was significantly correlated with tumor size, histopathologic classifications, and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that increased expression of RPS6KB1 correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. RPS6KB1 expression was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival of HCC patients by multivariate analysis. Our data suggest that RPS6KB1 may play an important role in the progression of HCC and could serve as a potential molecular target for HCC therapy.
BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /RPS6KB1 activation has recently been implicated in tumour development, but its role in lung cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of mTOR/RPS6KB1 signaling pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and its downstream ribosomal phosphorylated RPS6KB1 (p-RPS6KB1) in NSCLC patients. We also analyzed p-mTOR/ p-RPS6KB1 protein expression in 45 fresh NSCLC tissues using Western blotting. RESULTS: The expression level of p-mTOR and p-RPS6KB1 was significantly higher in NSCLC tumor specimens than that in adjacent noncancerous normal lung tissues (P<0.01). p-mTOR expression correlated with p-RPS6KB1. Furthermore, high expression level of p-mTOR or p-RPS6KB1 in NSCLC was associated with a shorter overall survival (both P<0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated high level of p-mTOR expression was an independent prognostic factor (HR=2.642, 95%CI 1.157-4.904, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: p-mTOR and p-RPS6KB1 could be useful prognostic markers for NSCLC.
Breast cancer risk is greatly increased in women who carry mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Because breast cancer initiation is different between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and women who do not carry mutations, it is possible that the mechanism of breast cancer progression is also different. Histopathologic and genetic studies have supported this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis further, we utilized a large cohort of women who underwent therapeutic mastectomy (TM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (PM). From this cohort, we developed case groups of women with a family history of breast cancer with BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations, with unclassified variant alterations, and with no detected mutation and matched these cases with sporadic controls from the same TM and PM cohort. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on paraffin sections by use of dual-color probes for ERBB2/CEP17, MYC/CEP8, TBX2/CEP17, and RPS6KB1/CEP17. All malignant and benign lesions, including putative precursor lesions, were studied. The invasive cancers from deleterious mutation carriers had a higher prevalence of duplication of MYC (P = 0.006) and TBX2 (P = 0.0008) compared to controls and a lower prevalence of ERBB2 amplification (P = 0.011). Coduplication of MYC and TBX2 was common in the in situ and invasive lesions from the deleterious mutation carriers. The odds ratio of having a BRCA1/2 mutation is 31.4 (95% CI = 1.7-569) when MYC and TBX2 are coduplicated but ERBB2 is normal. Unclassified variant carriers/no mutation detected and sporadic controls had a similar prevalence of alterations, suggesting that hereditary patients with no deleterious mutations follow a progression pathway similar to that of sporadic cases. With the exception of one atypical ductal hyperplasia lesion, no putative precursor lesion showed any detectable alteration of the probes tested. There was no significant intratumoral heterogeneity of genetic alterations. Our data confirm that a specific pattern of genomic instability characterizes BRCA1/2-related cancers and that this pattern has implications for the biology of these cancers. Moreover, our current and previous results emphasize the interaction between phenotype and genotype in BRCA1/2-related breast cancers and that a combination of morphologic features and alterations of ERBB2, MYC, and TBX2 may better define mechanisms of tumor progression, as well as determine which patients are more likely to carry BRCA1/2 mutations.
OBJECTIVE:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent disorder of nervous system inflammation which involves demyelination of spinal cord; this process depends on both environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. In the present study, we examined the association between two SNPs in RPS6KB1 (rs180515) and CD86 (rs9282641) with MS in Iranian population. RPS6KB1gene encodes p70S6K1 protein which plays a key role in mTOR signaling pathway, while CD86 gene codes a membrane protein type I which belongs to immunoglobulin super family act on co-stimulation signaling pathway. METHODS: In this case-control study 130 patients with MS and 128 matched healthy controls were enrolled, genomic DNA was isolated and genotyping was performed using mismatched PCR-RFLP. The results were finally analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: Our results showed significant difference in allelic frequency of SNP rs180515 among cases and controls (P = 0.004). For this variation, AA genotype was shown to have protective effect (P = 0.016 and OR = 0.6), while GG genotype was a susceptive genotype to MS (P = 0.04 and OR = 2.2). Allelic frequency of SNP rs9282641 also showed significant difference between cases and controls (P = 0.006). For this SNP, AG genotype had predisposing effect (P = 0.04, OR = 2.3), and GG genotype showed protective (P = 0.01, OR = 0.411). CONCLUSION: We successfully replicated the association of two novel SNPs introduced by a GWAS study, and MS in the Iranian population. This result can open ways for better understanding the mechanisms involved in MS.
