Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta; Ligand-activated transcription factor. Receptor that binds peroxisome proliferators such as hypolipidemic drugs and fatty acids. Has a preference for poly-unsaturated fatty acids, such as gamma- linoleic acid and eicosapentanoic acid. Once activated by a ligand, the receptor binds to promoter elements of target genes. Regulates the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acids. Functions as transcription activator for the acyl-CoA oxidase gene. Decreases expression of NPC1L1 once activated by a ligand. Belongs to the nuclear hormone [...] 
Recent studies showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) had effects on the progression of multiple tumors, but the role of PPARD and PPARG in glioma remains poorly understand. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in PPARD and PPARG with glioma risk and prognosis in the Chinese Han population. Seven polymorphisms (PPARD: rs2016520, rs67056409, rs1053049 and rs2206030; PPARG: rs2920503, rs4073770 and rs1151988) were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY system in 568 glioma patients and 509 healthy controls. The odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the association of PPARD and PPARG polymorphisms with glioma risk. The Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was used to analysis interactions of genetic polymorphisms on glioma risk. Then, we conducted log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model to evaluate the relationship of PPARD and PPARG polymorphisms with glioma prognosis. We found PPARD polymorphisms (rs2016520, rs67056409, rs1053049) were significantly associated with glioma risk in multiple models (P < 0.05). Stratified analysis showed rs2016520, rs67056409, rs1053049 of PPARD significantly decreased risk of glioma in the subgroup of age > 40 and astrocytoma (P < 0.05). For male, PPARD rs1053049 had a strong relationship with glioma risk in allele (P = 0.041), dominant (P = 0.040) and additive (P = 0.040) models. The effect of PPARG rs2920503 on glioma risk was related to glioma grade (P < 0.05). MDR showed that a seven-locus model was the best polymorphisms interaction pattern. Moreover, surgery and chemotherapy had strongly impact on overall survival and progression free survival of glioma patients. Our findings suggested that PPARD and PPARG polymorphisms were associated with glioma risk and prognosis in the Chinese Han population, and further studies are need to confirm our results.
Functional Gly482Ser (rs8192678) and T294C (rs2016520) polymorphisms in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PPARGC1A) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) genes, respectively, have been associated with mRNA and/or protein activity. The aim of this study was to determine their frequency distribution among 155 Israeli athletes (endurance athletes and sprinters) and 240 healthy control subjects. There were no differences between the endurance athletes, the sprinters and the control group across the PPARD T294C genotypes (P = 0.62). Similarly, no statistical differences were found between the subgroups of elite-level endurance athletes (those who had represented Israel in a world track and field championship or in the Olympic Games) and national-level endurance athletes (P = 0.3), or between elite-level and national-level sprinters (P = 0.9). However, a combined influence of these two polymorphisms on endurance performance was found. The PPARD CC + PPARGC1A Gly/Gly genotypes were more frequently found in the elite endurance athletes than in national-level endurance athletes (P < 0.000). In the cohort of endurance athletes, the odds ratio of the 'optimal genotype' for endurance athletes (PPARD CC + PPARGC1A Gly/Gly + PPARGC1A Gly/Ser) being an elite-level athlete was 8.32 (95% confidence interval 2.2-31.4). In conclusion, the present study suggests that PPARD T294C is not associated with endurance performance. However, a higher frequency of the PPARGC1A Gly/Gly + PPARD CC genotype is associated with elite-level endurance athletes.
BACKGROUND: Athletic performances are complex traits with heritability of ~66%. Dynamic balance is one of the most important athletic performances, and there has been little studies for it in sports genomics. The candidate PPARD gene was reported to be able to affect muscle development for balance predisposition and influence the athletic performance including skiing triumph in the Caucasian population. This study aims to investigate whether the PPARD gene is a susceptibility gene for dynamic balance performance in Han Chinese children. RESULTS: A total 2244 children were recruited and their balance beam performances were measured. Five polymorphisms in the PPARD gene were genotyped through the MassARRAY Sequenom platform. Rs2016520 exerted significant association with dynamic balance performance (minor allele C, P = 0.015, P(corrected) < 0.05) and was affirmed in a meta-analysis by combining previously reported Caucasian cohorts (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = [1.30, 1.91], P < 10 (-5)) . Another polymorphism, rs2267668, was also significantly associated with dynamic balance performance (minor allele G, P = 0.015, P(corrected) < 0.05). In the dichotomous study, 321 cases (61% boys and 39% girls) and 370 controls (49% boys and 51% girls) in our samples were selected as representatives, and the thresholds were the mean velocity (0.737 m/s) +/- standard deviation (0.264 m/s), in which rs2016520-C and rs2267668-G still remained significant (CI =1.41 [1.11~1.79], P = 0.004, P(corrected) < 0.016; CI =1.45 [1.14~1.86], P = 0.002, P(corrected) < 0.016). In different genders, consistent OR direction was observed for each variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the PPARD gene is associated with dynamic balance performance of human being, and further studies to reveal its etiology is strongly suggested.
Cholesterol metabolism is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis: increased cholesterol blood levels are detected in AD patients, and treatment with statins reduces the risk of AD. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta protein (PPARdelta), is a member of the steroid hormone super family of ligand-inducible transcription factors, and is of major relevance in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. We investigated three frequent polymorphisms located in exons 4 (rs2016520) and 9 (rs3734254 and rs9794) of the PPARdelta gene (PPARD) for their putative influence on the risk of AD and on plasma levels of cholesterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol. The study population consisted of 167 AD patients (mean age: 74.27+/-9.37 years; female 78.6%) and 194 controls (mean age: 73.26+/-8.37 years; female 57.2%). Haplotype analysis was perfomed, however, we did not find PPARD haplotypes to influence the risk of AD. In contrast to these results, a two marker haplotype consisting of rs2016520 and rs9794 in AD patients showed a significant effect on the relative plasma levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol (carriers: 32.1+/-2.8ng/mg; non-carriers: 40.3+/-1.4ng/mg; p=0.016) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (carriers: 40.8+/-7.7ng/mg; non-carriers: 58.6+/-2.3ng/mg; p=0.002) but not in non-demented controls. Our results suggest that PPARD haplotypes might influence levels of cholesterol metabolites in AD patients, but act not as risk factors of AD.
Animal studies have shown that the peroxime proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) gene regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Genetic variation in the PPARD gene might affect physical endurance and has been associated with obesity. We investigated the independent and modifying effect of variants in the PPARD gene with exercise participation and body mass index (BMI) on type 2 diabetes (T2D), using data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of middle-aged women living in Shanghai, China, with 1019 T2D cases and 1709 controls. The genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform. Imputation was used to determine missing genotypes. Participation in exercise was assessed by a questionnaire. Anthropometric variables were measured by trained interviewers. The association between polymorphisms and T2D was assessed by logistic regression analyses. The combined effects of polymorphisms in the PPARD gene with exercise participation and BMI on T2D risk was assessed by conducting stratified analysis with exercise participation and BMI categories. No significant associations between PPARD and T2D were found in either genotyped or imputed SNPs and no effect modification between exercise participation and PPARD genetic variation was found, suggesting that PPARD is not a risk factor for T2D in this population.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three diabetes-related genes (SIRT1, PPARD, PGC-1alpha) were investigated with a case-control approach. To examine the genetic association of those genes with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, we used the TaqMan technique to genotype five SNP sites for SIRT1, six for PPARD and eight for the PGC-1alpha gene, in 326 Finnish AD cases and 463 controls and conducted a single allele and genotypic distribution comparison as well as estimated haplotype frequencies between cases and controls. No significant differences in AD risk were found in single SNP and haplotype analyses for any of the three genes between 326 cases and 463 controls. However, in a subgroup of women older than 65 years, the frequencies of three SNPs in the SIRT1 gene were significantly different between AD and controls. We conclude that there is no real association with SNPs available in the present study between SIRT1, PPARD or PGC-1alpha genes and AD risk in the Finnish population.
Recent studies have revealed the importance of the gut microbiota in the regulation of metabolic phenotypes of highly prevalent metabolic diseases such as obesity, type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors that interact with PPAR-gamma co-activator-1alpha (PPARGC1A) to regulate lipid and glucose metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms in PPARD (rs 2267668; A/G) and PPARGC1A (rs 8192678; G/A) are linked to T2DM. We studied the association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs 2267668 and rs 8192678 and microbiota signatures and their relation to predicted metagenome functions, with the aim of determining possible microbial markers in a healthy population. Body composition, physical exercise and diet were characterized as potential confounders. Microbiota analysis of subjects with PPARGC1A (rs 8192678) and PPARD (rs 2267668) SNPs revealed certain taxa associated with the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. Kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes analysis of metabolic pathways predicted from metagenomes highlighted an overrepresentation of ABC sugar transporters for the PPARGC1A (rs 8192678) SNP. Our findings suggest an association between sugar metabolism and the PPARGC1A rs 8192678 (G/A) genotype and support the notion of specific microbiota signatures as factors related to the onset of T2DM.
BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) is nuclear hormone receptor involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) differentiation and progression. The purpose of this study was to determine prevalence and spectrum of variants in the PPARD gene in CRC, and their contribution to clinicopathological endpoints. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Direct sequencing of the PPARD gene was performed in 303 primary tumors, in blood samples from 50 patients with >/= 3 affected first-degree relatives, 50 patients with 2 affected first-degree relatives, 50 sporadic patients, 360 healthy controls, and in 6 colon cancer cell lines. Mutation analysis revealed 22 different transversions, 7 of them were novel. Three of all variants were somatic (c.548A>G, p.Y183C, c.425-9C>T, and c.628-16G>A). Two missense mutations (p.Y183C and p.R258Q) were pathogenic using in silico predictive program. Five recurrent variants were detected in/adjacent to the exons 4 (c.1-87T>C, c.1-67G>A, c.130+3G>A, and c.1-101-8C>T) and exon 7 (c.489T>C). Variant c.489C/C detected in tumors was correlated to worse differentiation (P = 0.0397). CONCLUSIONS: We found 7 novel variants among 22 inherited or acquired PPARD variants. Somatic and/or missense variants detected in CRC patients are rare but indicate the clinical importance of the PPARD gene.
CONTEXT: Mitochondrial function is associated with aerobic physical fitness and insulin sensitivity and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta (gene PPARD) and PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (gene PPARGC1A) are determinants of mitochondrial function in animals and in vitro. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to establish whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PPARD and PPARGC1A modulate the effect of exercise training on change in aerobic physical fitness and insulin sensitivity and whether they affect mitochondrial function in human myotubes in vitro. SETTING: The study setting was the Tuebingen Lifestyle Intervention Program in a university teaching hospital. RESULTS: After 9 months of intervention, the minor G allele of SNP rs2267668 in PPARD and the minor serine-encoding allele of the common Gly482Ser SNP in PPARGC1A were independently associated with less increase in individual anaerobic threshold (n = 136, P = 0.002 and P = 0.005), a precise measurement of aerobic physical fitness. Moreover, individual anaerobic threshold (+11%) and insulin sensitivity (+4%) increased less in subjects carrying the minor alleles at both SNPs (X/G-X/Ser), compared with homozygous carriers of the major alleles (A/A-Gly/Gly, +120% and +40%; P < 0.0001 and P = 0.015), suggesting an additive effect of the SNPs. In addition, low skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in vitro was detected in young carriers of the G allele of the SNP rs2267668 in PPARD (n = 19, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the rs2267668 A/G SNP in PPARD and the Gly482Ser SNP in PPARGC1A have both independent and additive effects on the effectiveness of aerobic exercise training to increase aerobic physical fitness and insulin sensitivity.
BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease characterized by apoptotic clearance deficiency provoking autoimmune responses and leading to multiple organ damage. PPAR-delta, encoded by the PPARD gene, was induced in macrophages promoting the timely disposal of apoptotic cells. Biological studies had provided solid foundation of PPARD involvement in SLE; it is worthwhile to further explore the genetic contribution of PPARD to SLE. METHODS: We performed a discovery-replication genetic association study. The discovery study was based on previous reported GWAS data. And the replication study was conducted in 1003 SLE patients and 815 healthy controls from Henan, Middle East of China. Further, we analyzed the eQTL effect to identify possible functional significance. RESULTS: In the genetic association analysis, we observed significant association between the risk C allele of rs4713853 (p = 0.03, OR 1.167, 95% CI 1.015-1.341) and increased SLE susceptibility. Moreover, individuals with the risk C allele were associated with lower expression of PPARD and DEF6. Our clinical analysis showed that SLE patients with the risk C allele of rs4713853 were more likely to present a higher proportion of anti-Sm antibody presence (CC+CT vs. TT, 20.0% vs. 14.2%, p = 0.039) and higher level of Scr (median inter quarter range CC+CT vs. TT, 56 48-71 vs. 54 46-64 mumol/L, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study identified a novel association between PPARD rs4713853 and SLE susceptibility in Chinese populations. By integrating multiple layers of analysis, we suggested that PPARD might be a main candidate in the pathogenesis of SLE.
BACKGROUND: Exenatide is a GLP-1R agonist that often exhibits considerable interindividual variability in therapeutic efficacy. However, there is no evidence about the impact of genetic variants in the PPARD on the therapeutic efficacy of exenatide. This research was aimed to explore the influence of PPARD gene polymorphism on the therapeutic effect of exenatide, and to identify the potential mechanism futher. METHODS: A total of 300 patients with T2DM and 200 control subjects were enrolled to identify PPARD rs2016520 and rs3777744 genotypes. A prospective clinical study was used to collect clinical indicators and peripheral blood of T2DM patients treated with exenatide monotherapy for 6 months. The SNaPshot method was used to identify PPARD rs2016520 and rs3777744 genotypes, and then we performed correlation analysis between PPARD gene variants and the efficacy of exenatide, and conducted multiple linear regression analysis of factors affecting the therapeutic effect of exenatide. HepG2 cells were incubated with exenatide in the absence or presence of a PPARdelta agonist or the siPPARdelta plasmid, after which the levels of GLP-1R and the ratio of glucose uptake were determined. RESULTS: After 6 months exenatide monotherapy, we observed that homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels of the subjects with at least one C allele of the PPARD rs2016520 were significantly lower than those with the TT genotype, which suggested that the PPARD rs2016520 TT genotype conferred the poor exenatide response through a reduction of insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR. The carriers of G alleles at rs3777744 exhibited higher levels of in waist to hip ratio (WHR), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and HOMA-IR compared to individuals with the AA genotype following 6 months of exenatide treatment, potentially accounting for the lower failure rate of exenatide therapy among the AA homozygotes. In an insulin resistant HepG2 cell model, the PPARdelta agonists enhanced exenatide efficacy on insulin resistance, with the expression of GLP-1R being up-regulated markedly. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the PPARD rs2016520 and rs3777744 polymorphisms are associated with exenatide monotherapy efficacy, due to the pivotal role of PPARdelta in regulating insulin resistance through affecting the expression of GLP-1R. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register (No. ChiCTR-CCC13003536).
