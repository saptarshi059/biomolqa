Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) plays a critical role in the hepatocellular uptake of structurally diverse endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Here we identified competitive and noncompetitive OCT1-interacting ligands in a library of 1780 prescription drugs by combining in silico and in vitro methods. Ligands were predicted by docking against a comparative model based on a eukaryotic homologue. In parallel, high-throughput screening (HTS) was conducted using the fluorescent probe substrate ASP(+) in cells overexpressing human OCT1. Thirty competitive OCT1 ligands, defined as ligands predicted in silico as well as found by HTS, were identified. Of the 167 ligands identified by HTS, five were predicted to potentially cause clinical drug interactions. Finally, virtual screening of 29 332 metabolites predicted 146 competitive OCT1 ligands, of which an endogenous neurotoxin, 1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, was experimentally validated. In conclusion, by combining docking and in vitro HTS, competitive and noncompetitive ligands of OCT1 can be predicted.
Contrasting results have been reported on the role of rs628031 and rs683369 polymorphisms of SLC22A1 and rs776746 of CYP3A5 on imatinib treatment response in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the present study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to estimate the impact of the above-mentioned gene variants on major molecular response (MMR) or complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in imatinib-treated CML patients. We performed a comprehensive search through PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane databases up to September 2017. The pooled analyses showed association between carriers of SLC22A1 rs628031A allele (GA + AA vs GG, OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.38-0.88, P = 0.011) or rs683369G allele (CG + GG vs CC, OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.96, P = 0.032) and a lower MMR rate. The combined analyses also revealed a correlation between the dominant (GG + AG vs AA, OR: 2.43, 95%CI: 1.12-5.27, P = 0.024) or the allelic model (G vs A, OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.09-2.72, P = 0.020) of CYP3A5 rs776746 with higher CCyR rates. The subsequent sensitivity analysis confirmed the statistical significance of CYP3A5 rs776746 among Asian CML patients (dominant model OR: 3.90; 95%CI: 2.47-6.14, P < 0.001; allelic model OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.47-2.95, P < 0.001). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis supports the association of SLC22A1 and CYP3A5 genotypes with clinical imatinib response rates of CML patients, nevertheless further large studies, particularly in Caucasians, are still warranted to provide conclusive evidences.
3D spheroids of primary human hepatocytes (3D PHH) retain a differentiated phenotype with largely conserved metabolic function and proteomic fingerprint over weeks in culture. As a result, 3D PHH are gaining importance as a model for mechanistic liver homeostasis studies and in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) in drug discovery. However, the kinetics and regulation of drug transporters have not yet been assessed in 3D PHH. Here, we used organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1/SLC22A1) as a model to study both transport kinetics and the long-term regulation of transporter activity via relevant signalling pathways. The kinetics of the OCT1 transporter was studied using the fluorescent model substrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+) and known OCT1 inhibitors in individual 3D PHH. For long-term studies, 3D PHH were treated with xenobiotics for seven days, after which protein expression and OCT1 function were assessed. Global proteomic analysis was used to track hepatic phenotypes as well as prototypical changes in other regulated proteins, such as P-glycoprotein and Cytochrome P450 3A4. ASP+ kinetics indicated a fully functional OCT1 transporter with a K(m) value of 14 +/- 4.0microM as the mean from three donors. Co-incubation with known OCT1 inhibitors decreased the uptake of ASP+ in the 3D PHH spheroids by 35-52%. The long-term exposure studies showed that OCT1 is relatively stable upon activation of nuclear receptor signalling or exposure to compounds that could induce inflammation, steatosis or liver injury. Our results demonstrate that 3D PHH spheroids express physiologically relevant levels of fully active OCT1 and that its transporter kinetics can be accurately studied in the 3D PHH configuration. We also confirm that OCT1 remains stable and functional during the activation of key metabolic pathways that alter the expression and function of other drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes. These results will expand the range of studies that can be performed using 3D PHH.
Twenty genetic variations, including seven novel ones, were found in the human SLC22A1 gene, which encodes organic cation transporter 1, from 116 Japanese individuals. The novel variations were as follows: -94C>A in the 5'-untranslated region (A of the translation start codon is numbered +1 in the cDNA sequence; MPJ6_OC1001), 350C>T (MPJ6_OC1004), IVS1-35T>C (MPJ6_OC1006), 561G>A (MPJ6_OC1010), IVS6+75C>G (MPJ6_OC1014), IVS8+108A>G (MPJ6_OC1017), and 1671_1673delATG (MPJ6_OC1020). The frequencies were 0.082 for IVS1-35T>C, 0.022 for IVS6+75C>G, 0.009 for 561G>A, and 0.004 for the other 4 variations. Among them, 350C>T resulted in the amino acid substitution Pro117Leu, which is located in the large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2. Also, we detected the four previously reported nonsynonymous variations, 123C>G (Phe41Leu), 480C>G (Phe160Leu), 1022C>T (Pro341Leu), and 1222A>G (Met408Val) with frequencies of 0.004, 0.086, 0.168, and 0.810, respectively.
In this study we report the cloning of four human OCT1 (hOCT1/SLC22A1) isoforms: a long form, hOCT1G/L554, and three shorter forms (hOCT1G/L506, hOCT1G483 and hOCT1G353). All four variants could be identified in the human glioma cell line SK-MG-1, whereas only two isoforms (hOCT1G/L554 and hOCT1G/L506) were found in human liver cDNA. The hOCT1G/L554 represents the full length hOCT1 since the sequence of this clone is more than 99% identical to previously cloned hOCT1 cDNAs. Elucidation of the gene structure of human OCT1 demonstrated that the other isolated isoforms are alternatively spliced variants. The hOCT1 gene consists of 7 exons and 6 introns. When stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, only the full length hOCT1 cDNA mediated decynium-22 (D22)-sensitive uptake of tritiated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3H]-MPP+).
BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications are of public health concern. Metformin is the most common pharmacological T2DM treatment, distributed through organic cation transporters (OCTs). The solute transporter family 22A1 (SLC22A1) gene encodes OCT1, and its variants may play a role in glycemic control. This study analyzed seven SLC22A1 gene variants and their potential association with glycemic control in patients from Northern Mexico with T2DM undergoing metformin monotherapy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 110 patients. We analyzed HbA1c values as a continuous variable and according to glycemic control categories (<7% vs. >/=7%). DNA from blood samples was genotyped using genotyping assays based on real-time PCR and PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Patients with GG or AA rs628031 genotypes were 2.7 times more likely to have inadequate glycemic control than those with the GA genotype (p = 0.042). We analyzed the combination of rs628031 and rs622342 as diplotypes. The relation between HbA1c and these diplotypes was influenced by BMI and the metformin dose. Carriers of at least one minor allele of A-rs628031 and C-rs622342 had lower HbA1c values than individuals homozygous for the major allele in both genes. CONCLUSIONS: The rs628031 and rs622342 variants are associated with lower HbA1c levels in T2DM patients. Larger studies are needed to confirm these associations.
Polyspecific transporters for organic cations (OCT) belong to a new protein family which also include organic anion transporters. The first human transporters from this family (OCT1, OCT2) have been recently cloned. They translocate small cations like tetraethylammonium, choline and monoamine neurotransmitters and are involved in hepatic and renal cation excretion, respectively. We have localized the OCT1 and OCT2 genes (SLC22A1, SLC22A2) on chromosome 6q26.
Proguanil, an antimalarial drug, undergoes hepatic uptake by the polymorphic organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) and is subsequently metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme into its active metabolite, cycloguanil. This study aims to evaluate and mechanistically characterize the effect of genetic polymorphism of SLC22A1, which encodes OCT1, on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of proguanil and cycloguanil in Korean. This study was based on a post hoc analysis of the PK results of a CYP2C19 mediated drug-drug interaction study (NCT04568772). Among the 16 CYP2C19 normal metabolizers enrolled in the previous study, 13 were prospectively genotyped for six SLC22A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a decreased function of OCT1. Among these, only the SNP SLC22A1 1022C>T (rs2282143) was observed, with four subjects being heterozygous (CT) and nine subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele (CC). The CT genotype showed a 1.2-fold higher systemic exposure of proguanil and a 0.6-fold lower exposure of cycloguanil compared to those in subjects with the CC genotype, resulting in a 0.5 to 0.6-fold lower metabolic ratio. Based on the PK and genotype data, a parent-metabolite joint population PK model including a well-stirred liver compartment was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. The OCT1 activity of the CT genotype was estimated to be 0.42-fold lower compared to the CC genotype. In conclusion, the genetic polymorphism of SLC22A1 1022C>T increased the systemic exposure of proguanil, while decreasing the systemic exposure of cycloguanil by reducing the hepatic uptake of proguanil, as mechanistically described by a population PK approach.
Interindividual variation is important in the response to metformin as the first-line therapy for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Considering that OCT1 and MATE1 transporters determine the metformin pharmacokinetics, this study aimed to investigate the influence of SLC22A1 and SLC47A1 variants on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin and the glycemic response. This research used the prospective-cohort study design for 81 patients with T2DM who received 500 mg metformin twice a day from six primary healthcare centers. SLC22A1 rs628031 A>G (Met408Val) and Met420del genetic variants in OCT1 as well as SLC47A1 rs2289669 G>A genetic variant in MATE1 were examined through the PCR-RFLP method. The bioanalysis of plasma metformin was performed in the validated reversed-phase HPLC-UV detector. The metformin steady-state concentration was measured for the trough concentration (Cssmin) and peak concentration (Cssmax). The pharmacodynamic parameters of metformin use were the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated albumin (GA). Only SLC22A1 Met420del alongside estimated-glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) affected both Cssmax and Cssmin with an extremely weak correlation. Meanwhile, SLC47A1 rs2289669 and FBG were correlated. This study also found that there was no correlation between the three SNPs studied and GA, so only eGFR and Cssmax influenced GA. The average Cssmax in patients with the G allele of SLC22A1 Met408Val, reaching 1.35-fold higher than those with the A allele, requires further studies with regard to metformin safe dose in order to avoid exceeding the recommended therapeutic range.
BACKGROUND: Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 1 (SLC22A1, also known as OCT1) protein has a vital role in the metabolism of metformin, a first-line anti-diabetes medication. Genetic poly-morphism in SLC22A1 influences individual response to metformin. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to compile the current knowledge about the effects of SLC22A1 genetic polymorphism on metformin pharmacokinetics and HbA1c levels. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA 2020 standards to conduct a systematic review. We searched the publications for all appropriate evidence on the effects of SLC22A1 genetic polymorphism on metformin pharmacokinetics and HbA1c from January 2002 to December 2022. RESULTS: Initial database searches identified 7,171 relevant studies. We reviewed 155 titles and abstracts after deleting duplicates. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 studies remained. CONCLUSION: Three studies found that rs12208357, rs34059508, and G465R had a considerable impact (p &#60; 0.05) on metformin pharmacokinetics, resulting in increased metformin plasma (Cmax), a higher active amount of drug in the blood (AUC), and lower volume of distribution (Vd) (p&#60;0.05). SLC22A1 polymorphisms with effects on HbA1c include rs628031 (four of seven studies), rs622342 (four of six studies), rs594709 (one study), rs2297374, and rs1867351 (one of two studies), rs34130495 (one study), and rs11212617 (one study) (p &#60; 0.05).
In Brazil, Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of cancer deaths in children and adolescents. Treatment toxicity is one of the reasons for stopping chemotherapy. Amerindian genomic ancestry is an important factor for this event due to fluctuations in frequencies of genetic variants, as in the NUDT15 and SLC22A1 genes, which make up the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of chemotherapy. This study aimed to investigate possible associations between NUDT15 (rs1272632214) and SLC22A1 (rs202220802) gene polymorphism and genomic ancestry as a risk of treatment toxicities in patients with childhood ALL in the Amazon region of Brazil. The studied population consisted of 51 patients with a recent diagnosis of ALL when experiencing induction therapy relative to the BFM 2009 protocol. Our results evidenced a significant association of risk of severe infectious toxicity for the variant of the SLC22A1 gene (OR: 3.18, p = 0.031). Genetic ancestry analyses demonstrated that patients who had a high contribution of African ancestry had a significant protective effect for the development of toxicity (OR: 0.174; p = 0.010), possibly due to risk effects of the Amerindian contribution. Our results indicate that mixed populations with a high degree of African ancestry have a lower risk of developing general toxicity during induction therapy for ALL. In addition, individuals with the SLC22A1 variant have a higher risk of developing severe infectious toxicity while undergoing the same therapy.
Dyslipidemia is the main risk factor for coronary artery disease and is characterized by alterations in concentrations of lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triacylglycerols. The participation of several genes in the development of dyslipidemia has been evidenced. Genetic variants in SLC22A1 have been associated with elevated cholesterol and LDL-c levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC22A1 gene with atherogenic risk lipid levels in Mexican women. Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed, and four SNPs in SLC22A1 were genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was verified, and haplotype frequencies were calculated. We found significant differences between the allele frequencies of the SNPs analyzed with those reported in Mexico and in the world, which could be due to differences in the historical admixture of the women studied. Generalized linear models were evaluated to determine the association between genotypes and haplotypes with lipids levels. We identified a significant increase in total cholesterol and LDL-c levels in women who were carriers of the GA and AG genotypes of the polymorphisms rs628031 and rs594709, respectively, significant effect that is also shown in a dominant inheritance model. Interestingly, we identified an important relationship of the AGC-GAT haplotype with the elevation in LDL-c levels and AGA-GAT haplotype with the elevation in HDL-c levels. On the other hand, we found a strong linkage disequilibrium between the polymorphisms studied. Our results show that variants in the SLC22A1 gene influence serum levels of atherogenic risk lipids, suggesting that these variants probably affect the function of organic cation transporter-1 and therefore, on the regulation of lipid metabolism.
BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the relationship between SLC22A1 and SLC22A4 gene polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han population. METHODS: The research group comprised 110 Chinese Han patients with type 2 diabetes, and the control group included 110 healthy volunteers. The polymorphisms of SLC22A1 gene rs628031 and rs2282143 loci and SLC22A4 gene rs2073838 and rs272893 loci were detected in the two groups. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were identified in the genotype distributions of SLC22A1 gene rs628031 and rs2282143 loci between the two groups (p < 0.05). The A allele frequency of SLC22A1 gene rs628031 locus and the T allele frequency of rs2282143 locus were higher in the research group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The genotype distributions of rs272893 locus showed a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05), but not SLC22A4 gene rs2073838 locus (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphisms of SLC22A1 gene rs628031 and rs2282143 loci and SLC22A4 gene rs272893 locus of patients with type 2 diabetes indicated a significant difference between the two groups, suggesting that these genetic locus mutations increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han patients.
Polymorphisms in SLC22A1 lead to variability in metformin clinical efficacy. Sixty-three Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes who administered metformin, were followed up for six months and genotyped for rs622342A>C. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximum concentration of metformin was highest in CC patients (P </= 0.03). There was a significant difference between groups in the percentage decrease in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1)c). Going into the same direction, rs622342C was associated with decrease in FBS levels after three and six months of treatment (P </= 0.02), whereas with HbA(1)c, the decrease was noticed after six months (beta = -2.78; P = 0.03). In contrast, the serum levels of lactate and creatinine did not vary significantly according to rs622342A>C genotypes. The rs622342A>C in SLC22A1 may be associated with metformin pharmacokinetics and variability in therapeutic efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether polymorphisms of SLC22A1 and SLCO1B3 genes could predict imatinib (IM) response and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) risk. METHODS: We genotyped SLC22A1 (c.480G > C, c.1222A > G) and SLCO1B3 (c.334T > G, c.699G > A) polymorphisms in 132 patients with CML and 109 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. The patients were evaluated for cytogenetic response by standard chromosome banding analysis (CBA). RESULTS: Polymorphism analysis showed significant increased risk of IM resistance for SLC22A1c.1222AG (P = .03; OR = 2.2), SLCO1B3c.334TT/TG genotypes (P = .007; OR = 4.37) and 334T allele (P = .03; OR = 2.86). The double combinations of SLC22A1c.480CC and c.1222AG polymorphisms with SLCO1B3c.334TT/TG were significantly associated with complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) (P <.05; OR> 7). The interaction between all polymorphisms and smoking were associated with CML development and IM resistance (P </=.04; OR> 3). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest the influence of SLC22A1 and SLCO1B3 polymorphisms and the interaction of smoking on CML development and IM response.
BACKGROUND Imatinib is actively transported into cells by the organic cation transporter (OCT1), encoded by SLC22A1. As a result, the expression of SLC22A1 is considered a prognostic marker for treatment with imatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although limited, there is conflicting evidence indicating that imatinib may affect the expression of SLC22A1. However, thus far, no studies have investigated the effect of imatinib on SLC22A1 expression in an imatinib-sensitive cell line, which would mimic a typical clinical setting. Changes in the expression of SLC22A1 as a result of imatinib could potentially negate its usefulness as a prognostic marker. MATERIAL AND METHODS The K562 CML cell line was exposed to varying concentrations of imatinib for 24, 48, and 72 h and SLC22A1 expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS Our findings suggest that imatinib affects the expression of SLC22A1 within 24 h in a non-linear concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to report on the short-term effect of imatinib on the expression of SLC22A1 in an imatinib-sensitive CML cell line. Our results suggest that imatinib affects SLC22A1 mRNA expression in a non-linear dose-dependent manner and that the changes in the expression of SLC22A1 as a result of the concentration of imatinib occur within 24 h of exposure to imatinib and remain stable thereafter for up to 72 h.
