PURPOSE: This study aimed to summarize and meta-analyze existing evidence regarding the influence of CYP1A2 genotypes on the acute effects of caffeine for exercise performance and to investigate the interaction between genotype, dosage, and timing of caffeine supplementation. METHODS: Six databases were searched for studies determining the effect of caffeine (except mouth rinsing) on exercise performance between CYP1A2 genotypes. Three-level meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean differences (SMD; Hedge's g ) to determine the effect of caffeine on exercise outcomes within and between CYP1A2 genotypes (AA, AC, and CC). Meta-regressions were performed for dose, timing, and presence of reported conflict of interests (RCOI). A meta-analysis was also performed with placebo values to assess for imbalances between genotypes. RESULTS: Thirteen studies, totaling 119 outcomes and 440 participants, were included (233 AA, 175 AC, ad 34 CC). Caffeine improved performance for AA (SMD = 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.21-0.39, P < 0.0001) and AC (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.06-0.25, P = 0.022) but worsened performance for CC (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.44 to -0.01, P < 0.0001). Dose affected only CC, with greater doses generating more positive SMD (CC-dose estimate: +0.19/1 mg.kg -1 body mass, 95% CI = 0.04-0.33, P = 0.01). Timing influenced only CC, with better performance with later onset of exercise after supplementation (CC-timing estimate: +0.01/min, 95% CI = 0.00-0.02, P = 0.02). RCOI only affected SMD of CC (CC-RCOI estimate: -0.57, 95% CI = -1.02 to -0.12, P = 0.01). After excluding studies with RCOI, no influence of genotype was seen (all P >/= 0.19). Small, nonsignificant differences were seen in placebo between genotypes (SMD AA vs CC: -0.13; AA vs AC: -0.12; AC vs CC: -0.05; all P >/= 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine improved performance for AA and AC but worsened performance for CC. Dose and timing moderated the efficacy of caffeine for CC only. Caution is advised because baseline differences and studies with RCOI could have influenced these results.
Recent trends in new drug discovery of anticancer drugs have made oncologists more aware of the fact that the new drug discovery must target the developing mechanism of tumorigenesis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of antineoplastic drugs. The drugs designed are expected to have high affinity towards the novel targets selectively. Current research highlights overexpression of CYP450s, particularly cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), in tumour cells, representing a novel target for anticancer therapy. However, the CYP1 family is identified as posing significant problems in selectivity of anticancer molecules towards CYP1A1. Three members have been identified in the human CYP1 family: CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1. Although sequences of the three isoform have high sequence identity, they have distinct substrate specificities. The understanding of macromolecular features that govern substrate specificity is required to understand the interplay between the protein function and dynamics, design novel antitumour compounds that could be specifically metabolized by only CYP1A1 to mediate their antitumour activity and elucidate the reasons for differences in substrate specificity profile among the three proteins. In the present study, we employed a combination of computational methodologies: molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. We utilized eight substrates for elucidating the difference in substrate specificity of the three isoforms. Lastly, we conclude that the substrate specificity of a particular substrate depends upon the type of the active site residues, the dynamic motions in the protein structure upon ligand binding and the physico-chemical characteristics of a particular ligand.

1. Aegle marmelos (bael) is a popular tree in India and other Southeast Asian countries. The fruit is usually consumed as dried, fresh or juice, and is reported to have a high nutritional value and many perceived health benefits. Despite its edible nature and therapeutic properties, no studies are reported regarding its effects on major drug metabolizing enzymes. 2. This study was aimed to evaluate the inhibitory potential of methanolic extract of A. marmelos fruit and its constituents (three furanocoumarins, namely marmelosin, marmesinin and 8-hydroxypsoralen, and 1 alkaloid, aegeline) towards major Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2C9 and 2C19) using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYPs. 3. The methanolic extract and marmelosin was found to be competitive and time-dependant inhibitor of CYP3A4. While reversible and non-competitive inhibition was observed for CYP1A2. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 was not affected by the addition of reduced glutathione. Marmesinin showed moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and 1A2, while aegeline was a very weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and showed no inhibition for CYP1A2 isoform. No significant inhibition of recombinant CYP2D6, 2C9, and 2C19 was seen with the extract or its constituents. 4. This is the first report of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibition by A. marmelos extract and one of its furanocoumarins, marmelosin. Further studies are warranted to determine if acute or prolonged use of bael fruit could affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2.
In the present review, the main features involved in the susceptibility and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) have been discussed, with the purpose of highlighting their potential application for promoting the management and treatment of patients with NDDs. In particular, the impact of genetic and epigenetic factors, nutrients, and lifestyle will be presented, with particular emphasis on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Metabolism, dietary habits, physical exercise and microbiota are part of a complex network that is crucial for brain function and preservation. This complex equilibrium can be disrupted by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors causing perturbations in central nervous system homeostasis, contributing thereby to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Diet and physical activity can directly act on epigenetic modifications, which, in turn, alter the expression of specific genes involved in NDDs onset and progression. On this subject, the introduction of nutrigenomics shed light on the main molecular players involved in the modulation of health and disease status. In particular, the review presents data concerning the impact of ADH1B, CYP1A2, and MTHFR on the susceptibility and progression of NDDs (especially AD and PD) and how they may be exploited for developing precision medicine strategies for the disease treatment and management.
Phenolic compounds and carotenoids are potential inhibitors of cytochrome P450s. Sixteen known compounds, phenolic compounds and carotenoids from seaweed were examined for potential inhibitory capacity against CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in silico and in vitro. Morin, quercetin, and fucoxanthin inhibited the enzyme activity of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in a dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) values of morin, quercetin, and fucoxanthin were 41.8, 22.5, and 30.3 muM for CYP1A2 and 86.6, 16.1, and 24.4 muM for CYP3A4, respectively. Siphonaxanthin and hesperidin did not show any significant effect on CYP1A2, but they slightly inhibited CYP3A4 activity at high concentrations. In silico modeling of CYP's binding site revealed that the potential inhibitors bound in the cavity located above the distal surface of the heme prosthetic group through the 2a or 2f channel of CYPs. This study presents an approach for quickly predicting CYP inhibitory activity and shows the potential interactions of compounds and CYPs through in silico modeling.
BACKGROUND: The previous published data on the association between CYP1A2*F (rs762551), CYP1B1 Leu432Val (rs1056836), Asn453Ser (rs180040), and Arg48Gly (rs10012) polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk remained controversial. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of CYP1A2*F, CYP1B1 Leu432Val, Asn453Ser, and Arg48Gly genotypes in colorectal cancer susceptibility. We performed a meta-analysis on all the eligible studies that provided 5,817 cases and 6,544 controls for CYP1A2*F (from 13 studies), 9219 cases and 10406 controls for CYP1B1 Leu432Val (from 12 studies), 6840 cases and 7761 controls for CYP1B1 Asn453Ser (from 8 studies), and 4302 cases and 4791 controls for CYP1B1Arg48Gly (from 6 studies). Overall, no significant association was found between CYP1A2*F, CYP1B1 Leu432Val, Asn453Ser, and Arg48Gly and colorectal cancer risk when all the eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. And in the subgroup by ethnicity and source of controls, no evidence of significant association was observed in any subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, this meta-analysis indicates that CYP1A2*F, CYP1B1 Leu432Val, Asn453Ser, and Arg48Gly polymorphisms do not support an association with colorectal cancer, and further studies are needed to investigate the association. In addition, our work also points out the importance of new studies for CYP1A2*F polymorphism in Asians, because high heterogeneity was found (dominant model: I(2)  = 81.3%; heterozygote model: I(2)  = 79.0).
BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that polymorphisms within CYP1A2 impact inter-individual variation in the response to caffeine. The purpose of this study was to explore the acute effects of caffeine on resistance exercise, jumping, and sprinting performance in a sample of resistance-trained men, and to examine the influence of genetic variation of CYP1A2 (rs762551) on the individual variation in responses to caffeine ingestion. METHODS: Twenty-two men were included as participants (AA homozygotes n = 13; C-allele carriers n = 9) and were tested after the ingestion of caffeine (3 mg/kg of body mass) and a placebo. Exercise performance was assessed with the following outcomes: (a) movement velocity and power output in the bench press exercise with loads of 25, 50, 75, and 90% of one-repetition maximum (1RM); (b) quality and quantity of performed repetitions in the bench press exercise performed to muscular failure with 85% 1RM; (c) vertical jump height in a countermovement jump test; and (d) power output in a Wingate test. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, caffeine ingestion enhanced: (a) movement velocity and power output across all loads (effect size [ES]: 0.20-0.61; p <  0.05 for all); (b) the quality and quantity of performed repetitions with 85% of 1RM (ES: 0.27-0.85; p <  0.001 for all); (c) vertical jump height (ES: 0.15; p = 0.017); and (d) power output in the Wingate test (ES: 0.33-0.44; p <  0.05 for all). We did not find a significant genotype x caffeine interaction effect (p-values ranged from 0.094 to 0.994) in any of the analyzed performance outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance-trained men may experience acute improvements in resistance exercise, jumping, and sprinting performance following the ingestion of caffeine. The comparisons of the effects of caffeine on exercise performance between individuals with the AA genotype and AC/CC genotypes found no significant differences.

Cytochromes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, the members of the cytochrome P450 family 1, catalyze the metabolism of endogenous compounds, drugs, and non-drug xenobiotics which include substances involved in the process of carcinogenesis, cancer chemoprevention, and therapy. In the present study, the interactions of three selected polymethoxy-trans-stilbenes, analogs of a bioactive polyphenol trans-resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) with the binding sites of CYP1 isozymes were investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The most pronounced structural changes in the CYP1 binding sites were observed in two substrate recognition sites (SRS): SRS2 (helix F) and SRS3 (helix G). MD simulations show that the number and position of water molecules occurring in CYP1 APO and in the structures complexed with ligands are diverse. The presence of water in binding sites results in the formation of water-protein, water-ligand, and bridging ligand-water-protein hydrogen bonds. Analysis of the solvent and substrate channels opening during the MD simulation showed significant differences between cytochromes in relation to the solvent channel and the substrate channels 2c, 2ac, and 2f. The results of this investigation lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular processes that occur in the CYP1 binding sites and may be useful for further molecular studies of CYP1 functions.
BACKGROUND: There is a high interindividual variability in cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) activity and in its inducibility by smoking, only poorly explained by known CYP1A2 polymorphisms. We aimed to study the contribution of other regulatory pathways, including transcription factors and nuclear receptors, toward this variability. METHODS: CYP1A2 activity was determined by the paraxanthine/caffeine ratio in 184 smokers and in 113 of them who were abstinent for 4 weeks. Participants were genotyped for 22 polymorphisms in 12 genes. RESULTS: A significant influence on CYP1A2 inducibility was observed for the NR1I3 rs2502815 (P=0.0026), rs4073054 (P=0.029), NR2B1 rs3818740 (P=0.0045), rs3132297 (P=0.036), AhR rs2282885 (P=0.040), rs2066853 (P=0.019), NR1I1 rs2228570 (P=0.037), and NR1I2 rs1523130 (P=0.044) polymorphisms. Among these, the NR1I3 rs2502815 (P=0.0045), rs4073054 (P=0.048), and NR2B1 rs3818740 (P=0.031) also influenced CYP1A2 basal activity. CONCLUSION: This is the first in-vivo demonstration of the influence of genes involved in CYP1A2 regulatory pathways on its basal activity and inducibility by smoking. These results need to be confirmed by other studies.
In this study, hydroethanolic extracts of 30 top-selling botanicals (herbs) commonly used as ingredients of herbal dietary supplements in the US were screened for their potential to activate the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) and human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (hAhR) and to increase the activities of hPXR- and hAhR-regulated drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes (i.e., CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, respectively). Of the 30 botanicals tested, 21 induced PXR and 29 induced AhR transcriptional activities. Out of the 21 botanicals that induced hPXR transcriptional activity, 14 yielded >50% induction in CYP3A4 activity at concentrations ranging from 6 to 60 microg/mL and 16 out of the 29 botanicals that activated hAhR yielded >50% induction in CYP1A2 activity at concentrations ranging from 3 to 30 microg/mL. Moreover, eight botanicals (G. gummi-gutta [garcinia], Hemp [low and high CBD content], H. perforatum [St. John's wort], M. vulgare [horehound], M. oleifera [moringa], O. vulgare [oregano], P. johimbe [yohimbe] and W. somnifera [ashwagandha]) yielded >50% induction in both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity. Herbal products are mixtures of phytoconstituents, any of which could modulate drug metabolism. Our data reveals that several top-selling botanicals may pose herb-drug interaction (HDI) risks via CYP450 induction. While in vitro experiments can provide useful guidance in assessing a botanical's HDI potential, their clinical relevance needs to be investigated in vivo. Botanicals whose effects on hPXR/CYP3A4, and hAhR/CYP1A2 activity were most pronounced will be slated for further clinical investigation.
PURPOSE: Many studies have examined the effect of caffeine on exercise performance, but findings have not always been consistent. The objective of this study was to determine whether variation in the CYP1A2 gene, which affects caffeine metabolism, modifies the ergogenic effects of caffeine in a 10-km cycling time trial. METHODS: Competitive male athletes (n = 101; age = 25 +/- 4 yr) completed the time trial under three conditions: 0, 2, or 4 mg of caffeine per kilogram body mass, using a split-plot randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design. DNA was isolated from saliva and genotyped for the -163A > C polymorphism in the CYP1A2 gene (rs762551). RESULTS: Overall, 4 mg.kg caffeine decreased cycling time by 3% (mean +/- SEM) versus placebo (17.6 +/- 0.1 vs 18.1 +/- 0.1 min, P = 0.01). However, a significant (P <0.0001) caffeine-gene interaction was observed. Among those with the AA genotype, cycling time decreased by 4.8% at 2 mg.kg (17.0 +/- 0.3 vs 17.8 +/- 0.4 min, P = 0.0005) and by 6.8% at 4 mg.kg (16.6 +/- 0.3 vs 17.8 +/- 0.4 min, P < 0.0001). In those with the CC genotype, 4 mg.kg increased cycling time by 13.7% versus placebo (20.8 +/- 0.8 vs 18.3 +/- 0.5 min, P = 0.04). No effects were observed among those with the AC genotype. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that both 2 and 4 mg.kg caffeine improve 10-km cycling time, but only in those with the AA genotype. Caffeine had no effect in those with the AC genotype and diminished performance at 4 mg.kg in those with the CC genotype. CYP1A2 genotype should be considered when deciding whether an athlete should use caffeine for enhancing endurance performance.
BACKGROUND: Despite its advantages over other antipsychotics, for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clinical use of Clozapine (CLZ) is challenging by its narrow therapeutic index and potentially life-threatening dose-related adverse effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: As the potential role in CLZ metabolism is assigned to CYP1A2 enzyme and consequently Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) their genetic variations might help to determine CLZ levels in schizophrenia patients. For this purpose, 112 schizophrenia patients receiving CLZ were included in the current study. Plasma CLZ and N-desmethylclozapine (DCLZ) levels were analyzed by using HPLC and genetic variations were identified with the PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: The patients' CYP1A2 and POR genotypes seemed to not affect plasma CLZ and DCLZ levels whereas in the subgroup analysis, POR *28 genotype significantly influenced simple and adjusted plasma CLZ and DLCZ levels concerning smoking habit and caffeine consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study highlight the importance of both genetic and non-genetic factors (smoking and caffeine consumption) for the individualization of the CLZ treatment. In addition to that, it suggests that the added utility of not only the CLZ metabolizing enzymes but also POR, which is crucial for proper CYP activity, to guide CLZ dosing might be useful for clinical decision-making.
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Evidence regarding the influence of coffee on appetite and weight control is equivocal and the influence of covariates, such as genetic variation in caffeine metabolism, remains unknown. Herein, we addressed the novel hypothesis that genetic variation in CYP1A2, a gene responsible for more than 95% of caffeine metabolism, differentially impacts the association of coffee consumption with appetite and BMI among individuals with different genetic predispositions to obesity. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cross-over randomized intervention study involving 18 volunteers assessed the effects of coffee consumption on dietary intake, appetite, and levels of the appetite-controlling hormones asprosin and leptin. Data on habitual coffee intake, BMI, and perceived appetite were obtained from an observational cohort of 284 volunteers using validated questionnaires. Participants were stratified according to a validated genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity and to the -163C > A (rs762551) polymorphism of CYP1A2 as rapid (AA), intermediate (AC), or slow (CC) caffeine metabolizers. RESULTS: Coffee consumption led to lower energy and dietary fat intake and circulating asprosin levels (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption=0.056, 0.039, and 0.043, respectively) as compared to slow/intermediate metabolizers. High coffee consumption was more prevalent in rapid compared to slow metabolizers (P = 0.008 after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI) and was associated with lower appetite perception and lower BMI only in rapid metabolizers (P for interaction of rs762551 genotype*coffee consumption = 0.002 and 0.048, respectively). This differential association of rs762551 genotype and coffee consumption with BMI was more evident in individuals at higher genetic risk of obesity (mean adjusted difference in BMI = -5.82 kg/m(2) for rapid versus slow/intermediate metabolizers who consumed more than 14 cups of coffee per week). CONCLUSIONS: CYP1A2 rs762551 polymorphism modifies the association of habitual coffee consumption with BMI, in part by influencing appetite, energy intake and circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone asprosin. This association is more evident in subjects with high genetic predisposition to obesity. ClinicalTrials.gov: registered Clinical Trial NCT04514588.
Bulbine natalensis, an emerging medicinal herb on the global market with androgenic properties, is often formulated in dietary supplements that promote perceived sexual enhancement. However, to date, comprehensive safety studies of B. natalensis are lacking, particularly those related to its herb-drug interaction potential. The purpose of this study was to assess the inductive and inhibitory effects of extracts and pure compounds of B. natalensis on human cytochrome P-450 isozymes in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that both water and methanolic extracts of B. natalensis as well as knipholone, bulbine-knipholone, and 6'-O-methylknipholone dose-dependently increased mRNA expression encoded by CYP2B6, CYP1A2, and ABCB1 genes. Functional analyses showed that water (60 to 2.20 microg/mL) and methanolic (30 to 3.75 microg/mL) extracts and knipholones (10 to 0.33 microM) increased CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 activity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, water extract (60 microg/mL), methanolic extract (30 microg/mL), and knipholone (10 microM) caused activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor up to 11.1 +/- 0.7, 8.9 +/- 0.6, and 7.1 +/- 2.0-fold, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition studies revealed that methanolic extract attenuated the activity of metabolically active CYP1A2 (IC(50), 22.6 +/- 0.4 microg/mL) and CYP2B6 (IC(50), 34.2 +/- 6.6 microg/mL) proteins, whereas water extracts had no inhibitory effect on either isoform. These findings suggest that chronic consumption of B. natalensis may affect normal homeostasis of select CYPs with subsequent risks for HDIs when concomitantly ingested with conventional medications that are substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. However, more in-depth translational studies are required to validate our current findings and their clinical relevance.
