Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used analgesics due to their lack of addictive potential. However, NSAIDs have the potential to cause serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular adverse events. CYP2C9 polymorphisms influence metabolism and clearance of several drugs in this class, thereby affecting drug exposure and potentially safety. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting these associations and provide therapeutic recommendations for NSAIDs based on CYP2C9 genotype (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are important drug metabolizing enzymes and together metabolize about 18% of currently available drugs. Some of the important groups of drugs that are metabolized by them are antihypertensives, hypoglycemics, anticonvulsants, antiulcer drugs etc. Genes encoding these enzymes are polymorphically expressed. Thirty variant alleles for CYP2C9 and 21 for CYP2C19 have been reported. The frequencies of these polymorphic alleles show marked inter-ethnic variation. Several reports have been published showing the clinical importance of this polymorphism. This review summarizes the currently available important information on this topic.
Introduction Phenytoin is a frequently used drug treatment for epilepsy. Genetic polymorphisms in the metabolism of phenytoin, particularly CYP2C9, are strongly associated with increased plasma concentrations and can result in toxicity. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are well-known genetic predictors of certain antiepileptic drug-associated severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Recent pharmacogenomic studies show genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9, as well as HLA alleles, are significantly associated with phenytoin-related SCAR. Areas covered Updated pharmacogenomic information of CYP2C9 variants and HLA alleles involved in phenytoin-associated cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) are discussed in this article. Expert opinion CYP2C9*3 has been identified as the most significant genetic variant associated with increased phenytoin concentrations and adverse events. Recent pharmacogenomic findings reveal that CYP2C9*3 and HLA alleles, i.e. HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*13:01, and HLA-B*51:01, are important genetic variants in the occurrence of phenytoin-induced cADRs or SCAR. A phenotype- and population-specific multigene panel can be used before prescribing to predict phenytoin-induced cADRs and further guide optimal dose selection.
OBJECTIVES: Genetic variation has been a major contributor to interindividual variability of warfarin dosage requirement. The specific genetic factors contributing to warfarin bleeding complications are largely unknown, particularly in Chinese patients. In this study, 896 Chinese patients were enrolled to explore the effect of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variations on both the efficacy and safety of warfarin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Univariate analyses unveiled significant associations between two specific single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1057910 in CYP2C9 and rs9923231 in VKORC1 and stable warfarin dosage ( P  < 0.001). Further, employing multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and height, the investigation revealed that patients harboring at least one variant allele in CYP2C9 exhibited a heightened risk of bleeding events compared to those with the wild-type genotype (odds ratio = 2.16, P  = 0.04). Moreover, a meta-analysis conducted to consolidate findings confirmed the associations of both CYP2C9 (rs1057910) and VKORC1 (rs9923231) with stable warfarin dosage. Notably, CYP2C9 variant genotypes were significantly linked to an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications ( P  < 0.00001), VKORC1 did not demonstrate a similar association. CONCLUSION: The associations found between specific genetic variants and both stable warfarin dosage and bleeding risk might be the potential significance of gene detection in optimizing warfarin therapy for improving patient efficacy and safety.
We report a case of intolerance to warfarin. A 20-year-old woman with toe pain was diagnosed with myxoma with multiple systemic embolisms. She was prescribed warfarin for remaining embolic pain after myxoma excision and mitral annuloplasty. Even on 1 mg of warfarin, the international normalized ratio was much increased. The patient was found to have cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9)*3/*3 and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) 1639AA genotype, which is extremely rare in Koreans. Based on this result, we assessed the potential risks and benefits of warfarin and decided to switch to aspirin because the risk of bleeding was considered to be too high.
Studies on the effect of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), and cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) polymorphisms on warfarin maintenance dose in children are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on warfarin maintenance dose in children. We searched relevant literature using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial libraries without any language restrictions from their inception to 23 July 2017. Dose differences are expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This review was registered in the PROSPERO prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42015016172). We included a total of nine studies (745 participants) in the meta-analysis. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*2, *2/*3, or *3/*3 required a lower warfarin maintenance dose compared with patients with CYP2C9 *1/*1 (SMD = -0.610, 95% CI: -0.802 to -0.419, I(2) = 0%). Patients with VKORC1-1639GA or AA required a lower warfarin maintenance dose compared with patients with VKORC1-1639GG (SMD = -0.666, 95% CI: -0.887 to -0.445, I(2) = 33%). However, no associations were observed between CYP4F2 polymorphisms and warfarin maintenance dose (MD = 0.005 mg/kg/day, 95% CI: -0.006 to 0.015, I(2) = 0%). These results were not affected by a sensitivity analysis. Our meta-analysis provides evidence that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variant statuses affect warfarin maintenance dose in children, but not CYP4F2.
INTRODUCTION: Notably differences in CYP2C9 allele frequencies among worldwide populations have been reported, with an interesting low frequency of the CYP2C9*2 allele in Amerindians compared with Admixed and European populations. AREAS COVERED: Literature was searched using the PubMed database and was focused on worldwide original research papers on CYP2C9 alleles and CYP2C9 phenotypes ("predicted" from CYP2C9 genotypes and "measured" metabolic phenotype with a probe drug) among healthy volunteers according to their ethnicity and geographical distribution. Seventy-eight original research articles including a total of 31,978 subjects were identified. EXPERT OPINION: CYP2C9*2 allele is the most frequent in Caucasian populations (average 14%), with the lowest frequencies for Africans (0.46%), East Asians (0.56%) and Native Americans (1.25%), which is in agreement with the hypothesis about the low prevalence in Amerindians. CYP2C9*3 shows the highest frequency among South Asians (11.7%), while CYP2C9*5 (1.56%) and *8 (4.70%) in African Americans. The predicted poor metabolizers (gPMs) were found overall in a low frequency, with the highest frequency detected for South Asians, in accordance with the CYP2C9*3 frequency in these populations. This study shows the worldwide variability in the CYP2C9 allele frequencies across different ethnic and geographic groups. Data about CYP2C9 "measured" metabolic phenotypes is still limited.
Diphenylamine NSAIDs are taken frequently for chronic pain conditions, yet their use may potentiate hepatotoxicity risks through poorly characterized metabolic mechanisms. Our previous work revealed that seven marketed or withdrawn diphenylamine NSAIDs undergo bioactivation into quinone-species metabolites, whose reaction specificities depended on halogenation and the type of acidic group on the diphenylamine. Herein, we identified cytochromes P450 responsible for those bioactivations, determined reaction specificities, and estimated relative contributions of enzymes to overall hepatic bioactivations and detoxifications. A qualitative activity screen revealed CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 played roles in drug bioactivation. Subsequent steady-state studies with recombinant CYPs recapitulated the importance of halogenation and acidic group type on bioactivations but importantly, showed patterns unique to each CYP. CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 bioactivated all NSAIDs with CYP2C9 dominating all possible bioactivation pathways. For each CYP, specificities for overall oxidative metabolism were not impacted significantly by differences in NSAID structures but the values themselves differed among the enzymes such that CYP2C9 and 3A4 were more efficient than others. When considering hepatic CYP abundance, CYP2C9 almost exclusively accounted for diphenylamine NSAID bioactivations, whereas CYP3A4 provided a critical counterbalance favoring their overall detoxification. Preference for either outcome would depend on molecular structures favoring metabolism by the CYPs as well as the influence of clinical factors altering their expression and/or activity. While focused on NSAIDs, these findings have broader implications on bioactivation risks given the expansion of the diphenylamine scaffold to other drug classes such as targeted cancer therapeutics.
Implementation of pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing has been hindered by inconsistent results from reported clinical trials and a lack of available algorithms that include alleles prevalent in non-white populations. However, current evidence indicates that algorithm-guided dosing is more accurate than empirical dosing. To facilitate multiethnic algorithm-guided warfarin dosing using preemptive genetic testing, we developed a strategy that accounts for the complexity of race and leverages electronic health records for algorithm variables and deploying point-of-care dose recommendations.
BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 play a major role in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of coumarin anticoagulants. The purpose of our study was to assess the relative frequency of the above mutations in Bulgarian population in order to predict bleeding tendencies and precisely manage the anticoagulant therapy during the postoperative period after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples from 200 Bulgarian patients subjected to cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation were analyzed for VKORC1 1639G>A and CYP2C9*2&*3 polymorphisms by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), then allele frequencies of various genotypes were calculated by Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. RESULTS: Median patients' age was 63.9 +/- 10.8 years; 66.5% were male. Median BMI was 28.6 +/- 5.4 kg/m2. Genotype distribution for CYP2C9 was *1/*1 - 51%, *1/*2 - 21%, *1/*3 - 13.5%, *2/*3 - 4%, *3/*3 - 2%, and *2/*2 - 1.5%. The calculated frequency of CYP2C9*1 allele was 74.25%, CYP2C9*2 allele was 13%, and CYP2C9*3 allele was 12.75%, and all allelic frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p-value = 0.358). The major VKORC1 genotype was G/A - 47%, followed by G/G - 35.5% and A/A - 17.5%). Based on Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, there was no significant difference between observed and expected frequencies (X - -3.779), presumably as a result of the homogeneity in the population. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the data obtained in the course of the study suggested that identification of homozygous carriers of VKORC1-1639 G>A (rs9923231) in Bulgarians may be useful in developing recommendations for personalized therapy. On the contrary, homozygous carriers of CYP2C9*2 or *3, included only 4.5% of the studied patients, thus indicating that this group would benefit less from dosing algorithms. Our results demonstrated good agreement with the results obtained in other studies conducted in the Caucasian population.
Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic drug. It is principally metabolized to inactive metabolites by genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 enzyme. In this study, we investigated the effects of CYP2C9*3 and *13 variant alleles on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glipizide. Twenty-four healthy Korean volunteers (11 subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1, 8 subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3, and 5 subjects with CYP2C9*1/*13) were recruited for this study. They were administered a single oral dose of glipizide 5 mg. The plasma concentration of glipizide was quantified for pharmacokinetic analysis and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured as pharmacodynamic parameters. The results represented that CYP2C9*3 and *13 alleles significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of glipizide. In subjects with CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP2C9*1/*13 genotypes, the mean AUC(0-infinity) were increased by 44.8% and 58.2%, respectively (both P < 0.001), compared to those of subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype, while effects of glipizide on plasma glucose and insulin levels were not significantly different between CYP2C9 genotype groups. In conclusion, individuals carrying the defective CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13 alleles have markedly elevated plasma concentrations of glipizide compared with CYP2C9*1/*1 wild-type.
Objective: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the associations between SLCO1B1, APOE and CYP2C9 and the lipid-lowering effects and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin. Methods: Studies were searched from inception to March 2023, including three SNPs related to fluvastatin, SLCO1B1, CYP2C9 and APOE. Weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs were analyzed to evaluate the associations between SNPs and outcomes. Results: SLCO1B1 521T>C was associated with lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein reduction. Patients carrying 521CC or total cholesterol had a significantly higher area under the curve than those carrying 521TT, but no significant difference existed. Conclusion: CYP2C9 and SLCO1B1 may be associated with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.
Gliclazide metabolism is mediated by genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes. We investigated the effects of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gliclazide. Twenty-seven Korean healthy volunteers were administered a single oral dose of gliclazide 80 mg. The plasma concentration of gliclazide was quantified for the pharmacokinetic analysis and plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were measured as pharmacodynamic parameters. The pharmacokinetics of gliclazide showed a significant difference according to the number of defective alleles of combined CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The two defective alleles group (group 3) and one defective allele group (group 2) showed 2.34- and 1.46-fold higher AUC(0-infinity) (P < 0.001), and 57.1 and 32.3% lower CL/F (P < 0.001), compared to those of the no defective allele group (group 1), respectively. The CYP2C9IM-CYP2C19IM group had AUC(0-infinity) increase of 1.49-fold (P < 0.05) and CL/F decrease by 29.9% (P < 0.01), compared with the CYP2C9 Normal Metabolizer (CYP2C9NM)-CYP2C19IM group. The CYP2C9NM-CYP2C19PM group and CYP2C9NM-CYP2C19IM group showed 2.41- and 1.51-fold higher AUC(0-infinity) (P < 0.001), and 59.6 and 35.4% lower CL/F (P < 0.001), compared to those of the CYP2C9NM-CYP2C19NM group, respectively. The results represented that CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of gliclazide. Although the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 had a greater effect on the pharmacokinetics of gliclazide, the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C9 also had a significant effect. On the other hand, plasma glucose and insulin responses to gliclazide were not significantly affected by the CYP2C9-CYP2C19 genotypes, requiring further well-controlled studies with long-term dosing of gliclazide in diabetic patients.
AIM: The aim of this study was to study potential cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction by dicloxacillin. METHODS: We performed an open-label, randomized, two-phase, five-drug clinical pharmacokinetic cocktail crossover study in 12 healthy men with and without pretreatment with 1 g dicloxacillin three times daily for 10 days. Plasma and urine were collected over 24 h and the concentration of all five drugs and their primary metabolites was determined using a liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method. Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes were exposed to dicloxacillin for 48 h and changes in gene expression and the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 were investigated. The activation of nuclear receptors by dicloxacillin was assessed using luciferase assays. RESULTS: A total of 10 days of treatment with dicloxacillin resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h for omeprazole (CYP2C19) geometric mean ratio [GMR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.33 [0.24, 0.45], tolbutamide (CYP2C9) [GMR (95% CI): 0.73 (0.65, 0.81)] and midazolam (CYP3A4) [GMR (95% CI): 0.54 (0.41, 0.72)]. Additionally, other relevant pharmacokinetic parameters were affected, indicating the induction of CYP2C- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism by dicloxacillin. Investigations in primary hepatocytes showed a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in CYP expression and activity by dicloxacillin, caused by activation of the pregnane X receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Dicloxacillin is an inducer of CYP2C- and CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism, and we recommend caution when prescribing dicloxacillin to users of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window.
OBJECTIVE: Human cytochrome p450 enzymes play an important role in the metabolism of various substances. The CYP2C subfamily consists of various important drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The objectives of the study include the determination of the frequency of genetic variants (CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C19*2) of selected enzymes using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) and its comparison with Indian as well as global past frequencies. We also aimed to study the impact of genetic mutation on clopidogrel efficacy and compare the efficacies between patients with and without CYP2C19*2 genetic variant. METHODOLOGY: In this study, the prevalence of variants CYP2C19*2, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3, the most popular variants of the respective enzymes, was determined using the ASPCR method. The correlation between the CYP2C19*2 variant and the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel was studied using platelet aggregation assay (PAA). RESULTS: The determined frequencies of CYP2C19*2, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3 are 46%, 9%, and 12%. These frequencies are indicative of homozygous as well as heterozygous mutations. Reduced clopidogrel efficacy was observed in patients with a heterozygous mutation of CYP2C19*2 variant. CONCLUSIONS: The observed frequencies are not significantly different from that observed in earlier reported studies conducted across India and the world. Antiplatelet activity, as measured using the PAA method, was significantly lesser in patients having the CYP2C19*2 variant. The therapy failure in these patients can lead to serious cardiovascular consequences, and we propose determining the presence of the CYP2C19*2 variant before initiation of clopidogrel therapy.
PURPOSE: The aim of this analysis is to compare the pharmacokinetics of drug substrates in healthy Chinese and European subjects of aligned CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 enzyme activity, providing further insight into drivers of interethnic differences in pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Following identification of appropriate drug substrates, a comprehensive and structured literature search was conducted to identify single-dose pharmacokinetic data in healthy Chinese or European subjects with reported CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 activity (genotype or phenotype). The ratio of drug AUC in the Chinese and European subjects classified with aligned enzyme activity was calculated (ethnicity ratio (ER)). RESULTS: For 22/25 drugs identified, the ERs calculated indicated no or only limited interethnic differences in exposure (<twofold) in Chinese and European subjects with aligned polymorphic enzyme activity. The interethnic differences observed can reflect differences across populations in additional determinants of pharmacokinetics, although the notable between study variation and change over time in methods used to assign enzyme activity may also be contributing factors. There was no association between drug substrate fraction metabolized (fm) for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 and the ERs calculated. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of pharmacokinetic determinants for each drug substrate and their differences across ethnic groups must be considered on a case-by-case basis in addition to metabolism by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. This analysis has also highlighted the challenges which arise when comparing published datasets if consistent methods to assign polymorphic enzyme activity have not been used.
