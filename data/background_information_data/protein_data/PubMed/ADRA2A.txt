Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor; Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine- induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. The rank order of potency for agonists of this receptor is oxymetazoline > clonidine > epinephrine > norepinephrine > phenylephrine > dopamine > p-synephrine > p-tyramine > serotonin = p- octopamine. For antagonists, the rank order is yohimbine > phentolamine = mianserine > chlorpromazine = spiperone = prazosin > propanolol > alprenolol = pindolol.
Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common vasospastic disorder that causes severe pain and ulcers, but despite its high reported heritability, no causal genes have been robustly identified. We conducted a genome-wide association study including 5,147 RP cases and 439,294 controls, based on diagnoses from electronic health records, and identified three unreported genomic regions associated with the risk of RP (p < 5 x 10(-8)). We prioritized ADRA2A (rs7090046, odds ratio (OR) per allele: 1.26; 95%-CI: 1.20-1.31; p < 9.6 x 10(-27)) and IRX1 (rs12653958, OR: 1.17; 95%-CI: 1.12-1.22, p < 4.8 x 10(-13)) as candidate causal genes through integration of gene expression in disease relevant tissues. We further identified a likely causal detrimental effect of low fasting glucose levels on RP risk (r(G) = -0.21; p-value = 2.3 x 10(-3)), and systematically highlighted drug repurposing opportunities, like the antidepressant mirtazapine. Our results provide the first robust evidence for a strong genetic contribution to RP and highlight a so far underrated role of alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptor signalling, encoded at ADRA2A, as a possible mechanism for hypersensitivity to catecholamine-induced vasospasms.
alpha2A adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) on platelets interacts with epinephrine, which has a key role in regulating platelet functions. There is familial clustering of inter-individual variations in the epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, the molecular basis of which, however, has not been fully understood. In this study, we screened the sequence variations in the transcriptional region of ADRA2A gene and analyzed the relationship between the two common polymorphisms and platelet function using epinephrine/collagen cartridge in the platelet function analyzer-100 system, in a healthy Japanese male population (n=211). Among the identified 16 sequence variations including five novel variations, 1780GG genotype was associated with longer closure time which represents low platelet function under high shear-stress conditions (p=0.0478). We also observed enhanced effect of the combination of 1780GG and 2372AA genotypes on longer closure time (p=0.0319). These findings suggest that 1780A/G and 2372A/G polymorphisms are associated with platelet function in interactions with collagen/epinephrine.
There is evidence to suggest that the alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor may be involved in schizophrenia. With attention directed at the upstream regulatory region of the gene which codes for this receptor (ADRA2A), we proposed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this region influences susceptibility to schizophrenia by altering the expression of this receptor. We opted to test for an influence on susceptibility by association study using 112 schizophrenic/schizoaffective disorder patients and 159 controls. The region of interest was screened for SNPs using a combination of bioinformatic searches and sequencing. A total of nine SNPs were discovered, of which four (-5972-G/A, -2211-A/T, -1291-C/G and -261-G/A) were genotyped in the entire clinical sample. No associations were evident, suggesting no influence for these SNPs in susceptibility to schizophrenia.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) manifests diverse molecular subtypes, including the classical/progenitor and basal-like/squamous subtypes, with the latter known for its aggressiveness. We employed integrative transcriptome and metabolome analyses to identify potential genes contributing to the molecular subtype differentiation and its metabolic features. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that adrenoceptor alpha 2A (ADRA2A) was downregulated in the basal-like/squamous subtype, suggesting its potential role as a candidate suppressor of this subtype. Reduced ADRA2A expression was significantly associated with a high frequency of lymph node metastasis, higher pathological grade, advanced disease stage, and decreased survival among PDAC patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADRA2A transgene expression and ADRA2A agonist inhibited PDAC cell invasion. Additionally, ADRA2A-high condition downregulated the basal-like/squamous gene expression signature, while upregulating the classical/progenitor gene expression signature in our PDAC patient cohort and PDAC cell lines. Metabolome analysis conducted on the PDAC cohort and cell lines revealed that elevated ADRA2A levels were associated with suppressed amino acid and carnitine/acylcarnitine metabolism, which are characteristic metabolic profiles of the classical/progenitor subtype. Collectively, our findings suggest that heightened ADRA2A expression induces transcriptome and metabolome characteristics indicative of classical/progenitor subtype with decreased disease aggressiveness in PDAC patients. These observations introduce ADRA2A as a candidate for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting in PDAC.
A dysfunction of the central noradrenergic system has long been suggested to be involved in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Pharmacological evidence from animal studies and clinical practice has identified the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2A) as a candidate gene in ADHD. Some findings from Caucasian populations seem to support a role for this gene in ADHD. The current study first examined the association of the ADRA2A MspI and DraI polymorphisms with ADHD in the Han Chinese population, which differs quite substantially from the Caucasian population in the frequencies of alleles at these polymorphisms. No biased transmission of alleles of either polymorphism was observed using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis in a sample of 268 nuclear families with an ADHD proband; however, haplotype analysis only identified a trend toward over-transmission of the M/C haplotype to probands with the combined subtype of ADHD (chi(2) = 3.233, P = 0.072). The mm genotype of the MspI polymorphism was also marginally related (P = 0.051) to lower ADHD symptom scores in a sample of 559 Chinese children with ADHD, which is inconsistent with data from Caucasian samples. Our results provide weak evidence for a possible role of ADRA2A in ADHD symptom expression.
Objective: To evaluate the role of the adrenergic receptor alpha-2A gene (ADRA2A) in the genetic etiology of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders (ADHD+TD). Method: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADRA2A were genotyped and analyzed in 936 normal controls and 1,815 ADHD probands, including 1,249 trios. Approximately 16% of the ADHD probands also had a diagnosis of TD. Results: No significant association was found between ADRA2A and ADHD in general. Case-control analyses indicated different allelic and genotypic distributions of rs553668 between ADHD+TD and controls in males. Family-based association tests showed that the G allele of rs1800544, the A allele of rs553668, and the GA haplotype consisting of these two SNPs were overtransmitted in the ADHD+TD trios, especially in males. Moreover, the allelic/genotypic distribution and allelic transmission were different between ADHD+TD and ADHD without TD. Conclusion:ADRA2A may be associated with ADHD+TD, especially in males.
OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder is a complex and severe mental illness characterised by manic and depressive episodes that can be triggered and exacerbated by psychosocial, environmental, and biological stressors. Genetic variations are a risk factor for bipolar disorder. However, the identification of the exact gene variants and genotypes remains complex. This study, therefore, aims to identify the potential association between genotypes of analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms and the presence of a stressor in bipolar disorder patients. METHOD: We analysed 114 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from bipolar and stress-related candidate genes in 550 patients with bipolar disorders (60.36 % females and 39.64 % male). We compared SNPs of patients reporting the presence (40.73 %) or absence of stressors (59.27 %) before the first episode using the Persons Chi-square test and Bayes Factor t-test. The genotyping of 114 SNPs was done using TaqMan assays. Statistical analysis was done using Statistica 13.3 software (StatSoft Poland, Krakow, Poland), R programming, and G*Power statistics. RESULT: We found significant differences in genotype distribution (p < 0.05) in 6 polymorphisms (AVPRIB/rs28536160, FKBP4/rs2968909, ADRA2A/rs3750625, 5HTR2A/rs6311, 5HTR2A/rs6313, and GLCCI1/rs37972) when comparing BD patient with and without stressor with a small effect of d = 0.2. Of these, two gene variants (ADRA2A/rs3750625/AC and AVPRIB/rs28536160/CT) with minor alleles formed an association with the presence of a stressor prior to the disease onset and favoured the alternative hypothesis using Bayes Factor Analysis t-test for hypothesis testing. CONCLUSION: This study presents a novel association of ADRA2A/rs3750625/AC and AVPR1B/rs28536160/CT gene variants in stress-related bipolar disorder with the AC genotype of ADRA2A/rs3750625 constituting a risk genotype and CT of AVPR1B/rs28536160 constituting a protective genotype. However, further functional analysis is required to fully understand their clinical and biological significance and interaction.
Emotional facial stimuli are important social signals that are essential to be perceived and recognized in order to make appropriate decisions and responses in everyday communication. The ability to voluntarily guide attention to perceive and recognize emotions, and react to them varies largely across individuals, and has a strong genetic component (Friedman et al., 2008). Two key genetic variants of the catecholamine system that have been related to emotion perception and attention are the catechol-O-methyl transferase genetic variant (COMT Val158Met) and the alpha2A-receptor gene promoter polymorphism (ADRA2A C-1291G) accordingly. So far, the interaction of the two with sex in emotion perception has not been studied. Multilevel modeling method was applied to study how COMT Val158Met, ADRA2A C-1291G and sex are associated with measures of emotion perception in a large sample of young adults. Participants (n=506) completed emotion recognition and behavioral emotion detection tasks. It was found that COMT Val158Met genotype in combination with the ADRA2A C-1291G and sex predicts emotion detection, and perception of valence and arousal. In simple visual detection, the ADRA2A C-1291G G-allele leads to slower detection of a highly arousing face (scheming), which is modulated by each additional COMT Val158Met Met-allele and male sex predicting faster responses. The combination of G-allele, Met-allele and male sex also predicts higher perceived negativity in sad faces. No effects of C-1291G, Val158Met, and sex were found on verbal emotion recognition. Applying the findings to study the interplay between catecholamine-O-methyl transferase activity and alpha2A-receptors in emotion perception disorders (such as ADHD, autism and schizophrenia) in men and women would be the next step towards understanding individual differences in emotion perception.
There is evidence for a genetic contribution to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although no candidate genes have attained genome-wide significance to date. Given that the noradrenergic system has been implicated in ADHD, the gene for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) has been hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of ADHD. The present investigation reports results from a meta-analysis of family-based studies that did not find a significant association between the MspI polymorphism of the ADRA2A gene and ADHD.
Motion sickness is a common central nervous system response, the primary sign of which is vomiting. Its susceptibility varies between individuals. To find predictive factors, we investigated the association of ADRA2A rs1800544 and HTR3B rs3758987 with motion sickness susceptibility and examined their mRNA changes during actual voyages. A total of 315 healthy college students were enrolled for SNP genotyping by the PCR-RFLP method. Blood samples were collected from another 42 subjects during two separate voyages to detect their mRNA expression changes at three time points. The frequency of the rs1800544 GG genotype in the susceptibility group was significantly higher (52.26%), and allele G increased the risk of motion sickness (OR = 1.585, 95% CI = 1.136-2.208). In the logistic regression model, the rs3758987 CC+TC genotype and rs1800544 GG genotype increased the risk of motion sickness-induced vomiting (OR = 2.105, 95% CI = 1.112-3.984; OR = 1.992, 95% CI = 1.114-3.571). The ADRA2A mRNA baseline was lower in the GG carriers and the HTR3B mRNA baseline was lower in the TC/CC carriers before sailing, then increased significantly within 24 h and then decreased after a long-term voyage. People carrying the rs1800544 GG genotype seem more susceptible to motion sickness. In combination with the incidence of vomiting during the actual-voyage experiments, our results indicate the involvement of rs1800544 and rs3758987 in motion sickness-induced vomiting.
Adrenergic stimulation is important for osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Previous research shows that this happens through beta2-adrenergic receptor (AR), but there are conflicting evidence on presence and role of alpha2A-AR in bone. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of alpha2A-AR and its involvement in neuro-endocrine signalling of bone remodelling in humans. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate alpha2A-AR receptor presence and localization in bone cells. Functionality of rs553668 and rs1800544 single nucleotide polymorphism SNPs located in alpha2A-AR gene was analysed by qPCR expression on bone samples and luciferase reporter assay in human osteosarcoma HOS cells. Using real-time PCR, genetic association study between rs553668 A>G and rs1800544 C>G SNPs and major bone markers was performed on 661 Slovenian patients with osteoporosis. alpha2A-AR is expressed in osteoblasts and lining cells but not in osteocytes. SNP rs553668 has a significant influence on alpha2A-AR mRNA level in human bone samples through the stability of mRNA. alpha2A-AR gene locus associates with important bone remodelling markers (BMD, CTX, Cathepsin K and pOC). The results of this study are providing comprehensive new evidence that alpha2A-AR is involved in neuro-endocrine signalling of bone turnover and development of osteoporosis. As shown by our results the neurological signalling is mediated through osteoblasts and result in bone resorption. Genetic study showed association of SNPs in alpha2A-AR gene locus with bone remodelling markers, identifying the individuals with higher risk of development of osteoporosis.
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the direct effects of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9 rs17577, MMP9 rs17576) and alfa 2 adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A rs553668) gene polymorphisms investigated in mothers and their newborns on maternal weight gain (MWG) during pregnancy and the newborn's birth weight (BW), taking into account the presence of other related factors. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in 197 mother-newborn pairs in an Obstetrics Gynecology Clinic, in order to evaluate the demographic and anthropometric parameters, and gene polymorphism. RESULTS: BW was positively correlated with maternal age (p = 0.021) and the educational level (p = 0.002), and negatively correlated with smoking status in pregnant women (p < 0.001). The MMP9 rs17577 variant genotypes in mothers led to a lower BW (p = 0.049). The mothers with a variant genotype of ADRA2A rs553668 gene polymorphism had newborns with a higher BW (p = 0.030). MWG and gestational age (GesAge) influenced BW (p < 0.05). We noticed that newborns' variant genotype of MMP9 rs17577 was related to a significant increase in BW (p = 0.010), while the newborns who carried the variant genotype of MMP9 rs17576 expressed a negative correlation, decreasing the BW (p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the role of MMP9 rs17577, MMP9 rs17576, and ADRA2A rs553668 SNPs in BW determinism.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine is titrated to achieve sedation in the pediatric and cardiovascular intensive care units (PICU and CVICU). In adults, dexmedetomidine response has been associated with an ADRA2A polymorphism (rs1800544); CC genotype is associated with an increased sedative response compared with GC and GG. To date, this has not been studied in children. DESIGN: We conducted a pilot study to determine whether ADRA2A genotype is associated with dexmedetomidine dose in children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty intubated PICU or CVICU patients who received dexmedetomidine as a continuous infusion for at least 2 days were genotyped for ADRA2A with a custom-designed TaqMan(R) Assay. Ten (25%) subjects were wildtype (GG), 15 (37.5%) were heterozygous (GC), and 15 (37.5%) were homozygous (CC) variant. The maximum dexmedetomidine doses (mCg/kg/h) were not different between genotype groups CC (1, 0.3-1.2), GC (1, 0.3-1.3), and GG (0.8, 0.3-1.2), (p = 0.37); neither were mean dexmedetomidine doses for these respective genotype groups 0.68 (0.24-1.07), 0.72 (0.22-0.98), 0.58 (0.3-0.94), (p = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: These findings did not confirm the results from adult studies where ADRA2A polymorphisms correlate with dexmedetomidine response, therefore highlighting the need for pediatric studies to validate PGx findings in adults prior to implementation in pediatrics.
The aim of the present study is to test for possible associations between the C-1291G polymorphism in the alpha2A-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2A) with tobacco smoking and alcohol dependence. The genotype and allele frequencies were compared in three groups of European-derived Brazilian males: individuals with co-occurrence of tobacco smoking and alcohol dependence (N = 110), with tobacco smoking (N = 121) and controls (N = 114). The frequency of the G allele was higher in the group with both conditions, intermediate among subjects with smoking, and lower among controls (chi(2) = 8.00; p = 0.02). The chi(2) partitioning did not reveal significant differences between the sample with the two conditions and the sample of smokers (chi(2) = 0.82; p = 0.36). Combining both groups, the difference to the non-smoking controls is higher than the one observed in the three-groups analysis (chi(2) = 7.18; p = 0.007). The results suggest a role for the ADRA2A C-1291G polymorphism, notably the G allele, in the predisposition to tobacco smoking. The influence of the ADRA2A gene in nicotine and other substance dependencies should be more extensively assessed in future studies.
Poor sleep is very common in patients in the ICU and hence, sleep quality is considered an important aspect of intensive care; however, the underlying mechanisms of poor sleep in patients in the ICU remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of rs3750625, which is located in the 3'UTR of adrenoceptor alpha 2A (ADRA2A), in sleep quality. For this purpose, luciferase assay was conducted to investigate the association between miR‑34a and ADRA2A, and the effect of rs3750625 on the binding affinity between miR‑34a and ADRA2A was examined. RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis were carried out to examine the regulatory association between miR‑34a and ADRA2A. The differences in sleep time and efficiency were compared between groups carrying the AC and CC genotypes of rs3750625, respectively. According to the results from an online search, miR‑34a could directly bind to the 3'UTR of ADRA2A, and such binding was confirmed by the observation that miR‑34a inhibited the luciferase activity of major or minor ADRA2A 3'UTR in a dose‑dependent manner in HCN‑1A and U251 cells. In addition, the ADRA2A protein and mRNA levels in the HCN‑1A and U251 cells were evidently decreased following transfection with miR‑34a precursors. Notably, patients in the AC group exhibited a similar level of miR‑34a mRNA expression compared with patients in the CC group; however, the ADRA2A mRNA and protein levels in the CC group were significantly increased in comparison with those in the AC group. In addition, the sleep time and sleep efficiency in the CC group were much higher than those in the AC group. Furthermore, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) values in both the AC and CC groups remained stable from 22:00 to 08:00, and the respiratory rates in both groups were quite similar. However, the heart rate of patients in the CC group was much lower than that of patients in the AC group. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that the genetic variant rs3750625 in the 3'UTR of ADRA2A affects the sleep quality of patients in the ICU by promoting the binding of miR‑34a to ADRA2A, and hence it may serve as a novel biomarker for the prediction of the sleep quality of patients in the ICU.
OBJECTIVES: Results from the published studies on the association of ADRA2A (adrenoceptor alpha 2A) variants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are conflicting and call for further assessment. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively summarize the effects of the two recently reported ADRA2A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs553668 and rs10885122 on T2D risk. DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched all the publications about the association between the ADRA2A SNPs and T2D from PubMed and ISI database updated on September 2012. Meta-analysis of the overall odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated by using the software STATA 11.0. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 40,828 subjects from seven eligible papers were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the present meta-analysis failed to support a positive association between ADRA2A SNPs (rs553668 and rs10885122) and susceptibility to T2D (OR=1.05, p=0.17, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.12; and OR=1.06, p=0.11, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.13; respectively). However, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the significant association between rs553668 and the risk of T2D was obtained in Europeans under the recessive genetic model (OR=1.36, p=0.02, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.76). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that the AA genotype of rs553668 in ADRA2A might be a genetic risk factor that increases T2D susceptibility in Europeans. However, rs10885122 was unlikely substantially contribute to T2D susceptibility.
BACKGROUND: The genetic polymorphisms of the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A), which plays a significant role in sedation, anxiety relief, and antinociception, particularly in dexmedetomidine, may differ in the degree of sedation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the genetic polymorphisms of ADRA2A (rs11195418, rs1800544, rs2484516, rs1800545, rs553668, rs3750625) on the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine. METHODS: A total of 131 patients aged 50 years or more from May 2018 to August 2019 were included in this study. The ADRA2A gene variants were evaluated using the TaqMan Assay. Dexmedetomidine diluted in normal saline to a concentration of 4mug.mL(-1) was infused at a dose of 2mug.kg(-1) to achieve procedural sedation (modified Ramsay sedation scale 4 [mRSS 4]). RESULTS: A total of 131 patients were evaluated. The genetic polymorphisms (rs11195418) of the ADRA2A receptor gene demonstrated no variation in our participants. The ADRA2A receptor gene polymorphisms (rs1800544, rs2484516, rs1800545, rs553668, and rs3750625) exhibited no differences in total dexmedetomidine doses (p>0.217), bispectral index at mRSS 4 (p>0.620), and time to obtain mRSS 4 (p>0.349). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that the genetic polymorphisms of ADRA2A did not affect the sedative efficacy of dexmedetomidine.
Adrenoceptors (ARs) consist of nine subtypes, which are involved in a wide spectrum of physiological functions and are the site of action for a considerable percentage of currently prescribed therapeutics. All AR subtypes (except alpha(1D)) can be polymorphic because of the genetic variations in the coding and non-coding regions. Sixteen sequence variations were identified in alpha-adrenergic 2A (ADRA2A) gene. Among them, ADRA2A C1291G polymorphism is one of the most important polymorphisms, which plays a major role in regulating neurotransmitter release, blood pressure, lipolysis, insulin secretion, and platelet aggregation. A C-G transversion results in an MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism located at 1291 bp upstream of the origin of transcription. Because Medline search showed no study showing the allelic frequencies, and no information is available on inter-individual variability of ADRA2A C1291G polymorphism in Turkish population, we genotyped 203 healthy Turkish subjects. Because of large genetic variation of the polymorphism, we aimed to find out the distribution of C1291G polymorphism in Turkish population. Furthermore, we evaluated the possible association between the C1291G polymorphism in the ADRA2A receptor gene and smoking. The frequencies for the 1291C and 1291G alleles were 64% and 36%, respectively. The genotype frequencies for C1291C, C1291G, and G1291G were 35.5%, 57.6%, and 6.9%, respectively, in Turkish population. The allelic frequencies (1291C and 1291G) and G1291G homozygous variant genotype were similar to those reported in different Caucasian populations; however, C1291C and C1291G genotypes were different. We also observed that the frequency of the G allele was slightly higher in smoker subjects and lower among controls. The ADRA2A G allele may play a role in the predisposition to smoking. There is a need for expanding genotype and haplotype studies because of its importance in various physiological disorders and to confirm the association of this polymorphism with smoking.
