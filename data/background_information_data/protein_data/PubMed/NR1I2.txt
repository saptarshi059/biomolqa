AIM: The goal of our study was to assess the impact of patients' genetic background on their sensitivity to carboplatin/paclitaxel hematotoxicity. PATIENTS & METHODS: Parameters describing sensitivity to neutropenia and to thrombocytopenia of 201 patients were extracted from a previous pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analysis, in order to assess their association with 52 candidates SNPs in 18 genes. RESULTS: Carriers of a T allele of SLCO1B3-rs4149117 were 19% less sensitive to thrombocytopenia than the homozygotes for the G allele (p = 0.00279). Carriers of two copies of the ATG haplotypes of NR1I2-rs1523130, rs3814055 and rs1523127 were 19% less sensitive to thrombocytopenia than those harboring other haplotypes (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Our results revealed the importance of SLCO1B3 and NR1I2 in the sensitivity to carboplatin/paclitaxel thrombocytopenia.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inconsistent results regarding an association between polymorphisms within the Homo sapiens nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 (NR1I2) gene and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported. A systematic review and meta-analysis was thus undertaken to determine whether NR1I2 gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of IBD. METHODS: Article retrieval was performed using on-line databases, such as PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and WOS. After extracting eligible data, Mantel-Haenszel statistics were applied to calculate the odds radio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and P value under a random or fixed-effects model. RESULTS: A total of seven articles with 4410 IBD subjects and 4028 controls were included. Compared with the control group, no significant increase in IBD susceptibility was observed for the -25385C/T (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.78 approximately 1.07, P=0.259), -24381A/C (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.87 approximately 1.06, P=0.378), +8055C/T (OR=1.06, 95% CI=0.97 approximately 1.15, P=0.186), or +7635A/G (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.87 approximately 1.05, P=0.348) polymorphisms within the NR1I2 gene under the allele model. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis failed to demonstrate an association between -25385C/T, -24381A/C, +8055C/T, or +7635A/G polymorphisms within the NR1I2 gene and overall IBD risk. A larger sample size is needed to validate our conclusion.
NR1I2 (PXR) and NR1I3 (CAR) are nuclear receptors that are classified as xenoreceptors. Upon activation by various xenobiotics, including marketed drugs, they regulate the transcription level of major drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and facilitate the elimination of xenobiotics from the body. The modulation of the activity of these two xenoreceptors by various ligands is a major source of pharmacokinetic variability of environmental origin. NR1I2 and NR1I3 genetic polymorphisms can affect the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic response to many drugs, such as irinotecan, tacrolimus and atazanavir. This review provides an overview of NR1I2 and NR1I3 pharmacogenetic studies in various therapeutic fields (oncology, immunomodulation and infectiology) and discusses the implementation of NR1I2 and NR1I3 genetic polymorphism testing in the clinical routine.
Polymorphisms in genes related to drug-metabolising enzymes may affect tacrolimus exposure. This study aimed to assess the influence of CYP3A5, NR1I2, and POR polymorphisms on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and outcomes in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).Forty-six adult patients receiving oral tacrolimus at an initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day for acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after allogeneic HSCT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Genetic polymorphisms were detected in relation to concentration/dose (C/D) ratios of tacrolimus and the incidence of acute GVHD and acute kidney injury (AKI).The CYP3A5 *3/*3 genotype and co-administration of voriconazole were significantly associated with increased C/D ratios of tacrolimus (p < 0.05). NR1I2 8055CC presents a significantly higher tacrolimus C/D ratio compared with carriers of 8055CT and 8055TT genotypes in allogeneic HSCT recipients with the CYP3A5*1 allele (p = 0.033). Younger age and recipients with the CYP3A5*1 allele were significantly associated with higher incidence of II-IV acute GVHD post-transplantation.CYP3A5*3, NR1I2 8055C > T, and concomitant use of voriconazole are important determinants affecting tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. Moreover, CYP3A5*1 allele and younger age are independent risk factors for II-IV acute GVHD in HSCT recipients.
Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a member of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 (NR1I2) that is a transcriptional regulator of several metabolic enzymes involved in clopidogrel metabolism. In this study we identified and evaluated the contributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NR1I2 and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 alleles to clopidogrel resistance (CR) and long-term clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (IS) patients. A total of 634 patients with acute IS were recruited, who received antiplatelet medication (clopidogrel or aspirin) every day and completed a 1-year follow-up. The selected SNPs were genotyped, and platelet function was measured. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and main adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were noted to assess the prognosis. We showed that SNPs NR1I2 rs13059232 and CYP2C19 alleles (2*/3*) were related to CR. SNP NR1I2 (rs13059232) was identified as an independent risk factor for the long-term clinical outcomes in the clopidogrel cohorts (P < 0.001), but similar results were not observed in a matched aspirin cohort (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that NR1I2 variant (rs13059232) could serve as biomarker for clopidogrel therapy and individualized antiplatelet medications in the treatment of acute IS patients.
OBJECTIVE: Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) is a serious adverse drug reaction, and its pathogenic mechanism is still largely unknown. Pregnane X receptor (PXR, encoded by the NR1I2 gene) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, and rifampicin is a human PXR-specific activator. Rifampicin and isoniazid co-therapy targets porphyrin biosynthesis via PXR and results in hepatic protoporphyrin IX accumulation and subsequent liver injury. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between genetic polymorphisms in NR1I2 and ATDH in an Eastern Chinese Han population. METHODS: A 1:4 matched case-control study was conducted using 146 ATDH cases and 584 controls. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and analysed. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between genotypes and risk of ATDH by the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with liver disease history, hepatoprotectant use, smoking history and drinking history as covariates. RESULTS: Patients carrying the GG genotype of rs7643645 were at a higher risk of ATDH than those carrying the AA genotype (OR = 1.864, 95% CI: 1.106-3.141, P = .020), and significant differences were also found under the recessive model (P = .029) and additive model (P = .021). Patients with a polymorphism at rs2276707 were at a reduced risk of ATDH under the recessive model (OR = 0.600, 95% CI: 0.364-0.988, P = .045). Subgroup analysis confirmed the relationship in mild hepatotoxicity cases under the additive model (rs7643645, OR = 1.429, 95% CI: 1.027-1.988, P = .034) and recessive model (rs2276707, OR = 0.478, 95% CI: 0.253-0.902, P = .023). Functional annotation using ENCODE data also indicated that rs2276707 and rs7643645 were located in the histone modification regions targeting enhancers or promoter (H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this case-control study, SNPs rs7643645 and rs2276707 in NR1I2 may contribute to susceptibility to ATDH in Eastern Chinese Han anti-TB treatment patients. Further studies in larger varied populations are needed to validate our findings.
PURPOSE: Temsirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that exhibits antitumor activity in renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma. The metabolism of temsirolimus and its active metabolite sirolimus mainly depends on cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/A5) and the ABCB1 transporter. Differently from sirolimus, no pharmacogenetic study on temsirolimus has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to identify genetic determinants of the inter-individual variability in temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and toxicity. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained for 16 patients with bladder cancer after intravenous infusion of 25 mg temsirolimus. Non-compartmental analysis was performed to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of temsirolimus and sirolimus, its main metabolite. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP3A5, ABCB1 and in their transcriptional regulator NR1I2 (PXR) was assessed by genotyping. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to assess associations between candidate SNPs and temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and toxicity. RESULTS: The ratio between sirolimus AUC and temsirolimus AUC was 1.6-fold higher in patients who experienced serious toxic events (p = 0.034). The frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in patients homozygous for the NR1I2-rs6785049 A allele (OR = 0.065, p = 0.04) or NR1I2-rs3814055 C allele (OR = 0.032, p = 0.006). These NR1I2 SNPs were also predictive of temsirolimus half-life and global exposure to temsirolimus and sirolimus. Finally, the effect of the ABCB1-rs1128503, ABCB1-rs2032582 and CYP3A5*3 SNPs on sirolimus pharmacokinetics was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SNPs of NR1I2 and its target genes CYP3A5 and ABCB1 are genetic determinants of temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and toxicity in patients with bladder cancer.
Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death worldwide, and dyslipidemia is an important multifactorial risk factor. Considering the involvement of nuclear receptors in metabolic pathways, and that some of the receptors act in lipid metabolism and homeostasis, the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of genetic variations in RXRA, PPARA, NR1I2, and NR1I3 on lipid and lipoprotein levels. Five polymorphisms in the aforementioned genes were genotyped in 622 Brazilians of European descent by PCR-RFLP or TaqMan genotyping assays. In general, carriers of the A insertion of RXRA rs11381416 polymorphism showed higher levels of triglyceride (TG; 1.80 +/- 1.20 vs. 1.52 +/- 1.20 mmol/L; P = 0.020). Moreover, sexual dimorphic association was found (gender*NR1I3 rs2501873 genotype interaction P < 0.001), males with NR1I3 rs2501873 G/G genotype had lower TG levels (ANCOVA, P = 0.009). Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the RXRA and NR1I3 genes influence lipid profile in a Southern Brazilian population. However, these general and gender association require confirmation in subsequent studies.
BACKGROUND: Nuclear Receptors (NRs), including PXR and CAR, are presumed to be ligand-dependent transcription factors, but ligand binding is not an absolute requirement for activation. Indeed, many compounds activate PXR and CAR by indirect mechanisms. Detecting these indirect activators of specific nuclear receptors in vitro has been difficult. As NR activation of either or both PXR and CAR can lead to drug-drug interactions and adverse drug effects, false negatives obtained with screening tools incapable of detecting indirect activators could present liabilities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish assays that identify indirect activators of human PXR and CAR. METHODS: Commercially available human PXR and CAR transactivation assays were used for analyses. RESULTS: We show that transactivation assays containing full-length nuclear receptors with native promoters can identify indirect activators of human CAR and PXRwhen compared to those of commercially available assays containing only the LBD of PXR and CAR. Of these two assay systems, only human PXR and CAR1 assays with full-length receptors and native promoters are capable of detecting indirect and ligand activators. With this capability, several kinase inhibitors were identified that activate PXR and CAR by indirect mechanisms. Furthermore by using both the LBD and full-length receptors, phenobarbital and midostaurin were found to be direct and indirect activators of PXR while human CAR activation by phenobarbital occurs by indirect mechanisms only. CONCLUSION: Cell based transactivation assays employing the full-length receptors and native promoters identify both direct and indirect activators of either or both human PXR and CAR.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nuclear receptors PXR (pregnane X receptor, NR1I2) and CAR (constitutive androstane receptor, NR1I3) are key regulators of irinotecan metabolism, and ligand-dependent modulation of their activity leads to significant drug-drug interactions. Because genetic polymorphisms can also affect the activity of these xenobiotic-sensing receptors, we hypothesized that they could contribute to the interpatient variability of irinotecan pharmacokinetics and to the toxicity of irinotecan-based regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort of 109 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with irinotecan (180 mg/m(2)) in combination with other drugs, associations were assessed between 21 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms of NR1I2 or NR1I3 and pharmacokinetic parameters or toxicity of irinotecan and its metabolites. RESULTS: After adjustment of the tests by the UGT1A1*28 genotype and correction for multiple testing, the A allele of NR1I2-rs10934498 was associated with a decreased exposition and an increased degradation of SN-38, the active metabolite (p = 0.009 and p = 0.017, respectively). The risk of hematological toxicity was associated with NR1I2-rs10934498 and NR1I2-rs2472677 (p = 0.009 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal for the first time the involvement of NR1I2 in the pharmacogenetics of irinotecan and suggest that it may help to predict the toxicity of low-dose irinotecan.
OBJECTIVES: Several genetic factors were identified to be responsible for interidividual variability in tacrolimus (TAC) pharmacokinetics, with the predominant role of CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 polymorphisms. In this study, genetic variants of NR1I2 and NR1I3 nuclear receptors (responsible for the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters at the transcriptional level) were evaluated for their potential association with altered TAC concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty White kidney transplant patients were genotyped for five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3814055, rs6785049, rs2276707, rs2307424, and rs2307418) in NR1I2 and NR1I3 genes. Genetic data were analyzed in relation to TAC dose-adjusted trough concentration measured 6 months after transplantation (unadjusted and adjusted for patient's CYP3A5 expresser status). RESULTS: There were significant differences in TAC concentrations between patients with different NR1I2 rs3814055:C>T genotypes (mean values: 121.3 ng/ml mg/kg in major CC homozygotes, 169.6 ng/ml mg/kg in CT heterozygotes, and 186.0 ng/ml mg/kg in patients homozygous for the minor T allele) that remained significant after excluding CYP3A5 expressers from analysis. The TAC dose administered to minor T allele carriers (CT or TT genotype) was significantly lower (~22%) compared with CC homozygotes. For all the other loci analyzed, no significant associations were noted. CONCLUSION: Our results support the previous data on the functionality of NR1I2 rs3814055 single-nucleotide polymorphism that points to its association with interindividual differences in activity and inducibility of a broad range of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
The hypothesis was tested that sequence diversity in pregnane X receptor (PXR) cis-regulatory regions is a significant determinant of variation in inducible and constitutive CYP3A4 expression. A combination of comparative genomics and computational algorithms was used to select regions of the human PXR promoter and intron 1 that were resequenced in the polymorphism discovery resource 24 DNA subset. PXR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were then genotyped in donor human livers phenotyped for CYP3A4 and multidrug resistance protein 1 mRNA and primary human hepatocytes phenotyped for basal and rifampin-inducible CYP3A4 activity. The human PXR promoter [16.9 kilobase (kb)] was significantly larger than in rodents (2.9 kb). Eighty-nine SNPs were identified in the promoter and intron 1 of PXR. The SNPs most consistently associated with CYP3A4 phenotypic measures were a 44477T>C(-1359) promoter SNP (in linkage disequilibrium with SNP 463970, a 6-base pair deletion in intron 1a, and SNP 46551, a C nucleotide insertion in intron 1b); SNP 63396C>T in intron 1 (in linkage disequilibrium with SNP 63704A>G, a 63813(CAAA)(CA) variable repeat, and SNP 65104T>C); and SNP 56348C>A, SNP 69789A>G, and SNP 66034T>C. Donor livers with the variant PXR alleles had altered hepatic expression of PXR targets compared with livers with PXR wild-type alleles. These results identified PXR promoter and intron 1 SNPs associated with PXR target gene expression (CYP3A4) in donor livers and cultured hepatocytes and that a striking number of the linked intron 1 SNPs will affect putative binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor 3beta (FOXA2), a transcription factor linked with PXR expression.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was investigate the association between six genetic variants in the nuclear receptor genes PPARA, RXRA, NR1I2 and NR1I3 and the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of statin therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on 240 Brazilian hypercholesterolemic patients on simvastatin and atorvastatin therapy. The polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-based methods. RESULTS: The NR1I3 rs2307424 genotype distribution was different between subjects with and without adverse drug reactions. Among subjects in the ADR group, no T/T homozygotes were observed for this polymorphism, while in the non-ADR group the frequency of this genotype was 19.4% (P = 0.007, after multiple testing corrections P = 0.042). CONCLUSION: The polymorphisms investigated in PPARA (rs1800206), RXRA (rs11381416), and NR1I2 (rs1523130) did not influence the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of statin. Our results show the possible influence of NR1I3 genetic variant on the safety of statin.
In this large cross-sectional study, we investigated the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and circulating sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in 1988 healthy postmenopausal women and their interactions with polymorphisms in genes involved in estrogen signaling. Plasma estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, and SHBG were measured. Urinary levels of five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, and equol) and two lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) were measured and used as biomarkers for dietary intakes. Eighteen polymorphisms in ESR1, ESR2, and NR1I2 genes were genotyped. Results showed that lignans were positively associated with plasma SHBG levels (eta(p)(2) = 1.2%; P < 0.001) and negatively associated with plasma testosterone (eta(p)(2) = 0.2%; P = 0.042). Equol was negatively associated with plasma estradiol levels (eta(p)(2) = 0.3%; P = 0.028), whereas O-desmethylangolensin was positively associated with plasma estradiol level (eta(p)(2) = 0.3%; P = 0.010). There were significant phytoestrogen interactions with polymorphisms in ESR1 and NR1I2 genes in affecting estrone levels. We conclude that phytoestrogens modulate sex hormone and SHBG levels in postmenopausal women and interact with gene variants involved in estrogen signaling. Such phytoestrogen-gene interactions may explain the conflicting literature on the hormonal effects of phytoestrogens.
BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy including HIV protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can both inhibit and induce expression of cytochrome P450s, potentially leading to drug interactions. However, information is lacking on the impact of genetic polymorphism on this interaction. METHODS: This study examines the prevalence of 33 polymorphisms in NR1I2 (pregnane X receptor [PXR]), CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 in 1013 white and sub-Saharan African patients with HIV; explores the inductive ability of 16 antiretrovirals on CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 promoter activity through nuclear receptors PXR and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR); and evaluates the influence of naturally occurring PXR genetic variants on antiretroviral activation. RESULTS: Seventeen polymorphisms were present at different frequencies between the two ethnicities. Darunavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, tipranavir, efavirenz, and abacavir increased CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 promoter activity, some through constitutive androstane receptor but mainly through PXR. Addition of low-dose ritonavir enhanced levels of CYP promoter activity for several protease inhibitors. Some PXR variants displayed lower fosamprenavir- and lopinavir-induced CYP3A4 promoter activity than the PXR reference sequence, whereas efavirenz and nelfinavir induction was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of NR1I2 polymorphisms can alter the induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 promoter activity, potentially adding to the unpredictable nature of antiretroviral drug interactions. These polymorphisms differ in prevalence between whites and sub-Saharan Africans.
