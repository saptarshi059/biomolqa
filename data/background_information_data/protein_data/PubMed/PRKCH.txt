Protein kinase C eta type; Calcium-independent, phospholipid- and diacylglycerol (DAG)- dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation in keratinocytes and pre-B cell receptor, mediates regulation of epithelial tight junction integrity and foam cell formation, and is required for glioblastoma proliferation and apoptosis prevention in MCF-7 cells. In keratinocytes, binds and activates the tyrosine kinase FYN, which in turn blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and leads to keratinocyte growth arrest and differentia [...] 
Cerebral infarction is the most common type of stroke and often causes long-term disability. To investigate the genetic contribution to cerebral infarction, we conducted a case-control study using 52,608 gene-based tag SNPs selected from the JSNP database. Here we report that a nonsynonymous SNP in a member of protein kinase C (PKC) family, PRKCH, was significantly associated with lacunar infarction in two independent Japanese samples (P = 5.1 x 10(-7), crude odds ratio of 1.40). This SNP is likely to affect PKC activity. Furthermore, a 14-year follow-up cohort study in Hisayama (Fukuoka, Japan) supported involvement of this SNP in the development of cerebral infarction (P = 0.03, age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of 2.83). We also found that PKCeta was expressed mainly in vascular endothelial cells and foamy macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions, and its expression increased as the lesion type progressed. Our results support a role for PRKCH in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded noncoding RNAs with 18 to 25 nucleotides and play critical roles in a wide spectrum of biological processes. We repored that miR-185 inhibited hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication without affecting the proliferation of HepG2 2.2.15 cells, compared with the controls. We identified that protein kinase C eta (PRKCH) is a direct target gene of miR-185 that affects HBV replication and protein expression and that the miR-185 may suppress HBV replication. Our results provide more information for gene therapy in HBV infection. Keywords: miR-185; HBV; HBV surface antigen; viral replication; PRKCH.
BACKGROUND: The mechanism of PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 proteins in serum diagnosis of neonatal sepsis (NS) was explored. METHODS: Analysis of PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 expression in serum from NS patients and their correlations were manifested. Evaluation of the ability of PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 to identify NS was manifested. Analysis of the prognostic value of PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 was in NS. RESULTS: Elevated PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 were found in serum from NS patients. Serum PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 have diagnostic value for NS. Moreover, PALLD could predict the overall survival of NS patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study clarifies elevated PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 in NS patients. Meanwhile, PALLD, PRKCH, AKAP12, PDK4, and CHIT1 are available to offer brand-new non-invasive biomarkers for NS's prognosis and diagnosis.
We study the association between three protein kinase C, eta gene polymorphisms (+8134C/T, rs912620, rs959728), and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. One hundred French Caucasian rheumatoid arthritis trio families were genotyped. Relative quantification of protein kinase C, eta mRNA expression was performed from whole blood in 24 unrelated rheumatoid arthritis patients and in 16 healthy controls. Our results showed no significant association or linkage between the protein kinase C, eta polymorphisms, and rheumatoid arthritis. The protein kinase C, eta mRNA was expressed at lower level in rheumatoid arthritis unrelated patients than in healthy controls. This study shows that protein kinase C, eta gene is not a Rheumatoid Arthritis major susceptibility genetic factor in the French Caucasian population. Furthermore, the lower expression of this gene in rheumatoid arthritis patients comparing to healthy controls suggests that protein kinase C, eta could be associated with the patho-physiologic mechanism of rheumatoid arthritis.
BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease characterized by progressive cartilage degradation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the initiation and development of OA. This study aimed to explore the potential role and mechanism of circRNA protein kinase C eta (circ-PRKCH) in OA. METHODS: A total of 30 cartilage specimens were collected from OA patients or normal subjects. Human chondrocytes (CHON-001) were stimulated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) to establish an in vitro OA model. The expression levels of circ-PRKCH, microRNA-502-5p (miR-502-5p) and circ-PRKCH or A disintegrin and metalloproteases metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in cartilage specimens and IL-1beta-treated chondrocytes were detected by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot, and their correlation in OA cartilage specimens was analysed by Spearman's correlation coefficient. The targeted relationship between miR-502-5p and circ-PRKCH or ADAMTS5 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU), flow cytometry, wound healing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were applied to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory response in IL-1beta-treated chondrocytes. Exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Western blot. RESULTS: Circ-PRKCH and ADAMTS5 expression levels were up-regulated, while miR-502-5p expression was down-regulated in OA cartilage tissues and IL-1beta-treated chondrocytes. Depletion of circ-PRKCH relieved IL-1beta-treated chondrocyte cell phenotypic changes by promoting cell proliferation and migration, as well as inhibiting apoptosis and inflammatory response. Mechanically, circ-PRKCH acted as a sponge for miR-502-5p to regulate ADAMTS5 expression, thereby contributing to IL-1beta-treated chondrocyte cell phenotypic changes. Moreover, exosomes derived from IL-1beta-treated chondrocytes could transfer circ-PRKCH across cells. CONCLUSION: Circ-PRKCH contributed to IL-1beta-treated cell phenotypic changes in chondrocytes via modulating miR-502-5p/ADAMTS5 pathway, which might provide a promising biomarker for OA treatment.
BACKGROUND: PRKCH is a member of the PKC family with the potential to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Glioma is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system, with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that PRKCH can promote the proliferation of glioma cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the promoting effect and possible mechanism of PRKCH on glioma development. METHODS: Tumor tissue and paracancerous tissue were collected from 160 glioma patients treated at the General Hospital of Northern Theater Command. The expression level of PRKCH was detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Univariate/multivariate analysis and log-rank analysis, as well as prognosis and survival analysis, were performed using SPSS26 software. The PRKCH overexpression model was constructed in vitro to study the effect of PRKCH expression on the characteristics of glioma stem cells. RESULTS: The expression of PRKCH in glioma tissues was higher than that in adjacent tissues. PRKCH expression level is an independent prognostic factor in glioma patients, promoting poor prognosis and shorter survival in glioma patients. Furthermore, overexpression of PRKCH in glioma stem cells significantly increased stem cell properties and enhanced cell viability. Downregulation of PRKCH significantly inhibited the progression of glioma stem cells. CONCLUSION: PRKCH promotes the development of gliomas and may be a therapeutic target for gliomas.
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of PRKCH rs2230500 genetic polymorphism on efficacy of amlodipine and telmisartan for patients with hypertension. A total of 136 essential hypertension (EH) patients were treated with amlodipine (70 patients) or telmisartan (66 patients), respectively. Genetic polymorphism was genotyped by Sanger sequencing. Both baseline and post-treatment blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphism on the antihypertensive response. No significant difference in the absolute decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP),systolic blood pressure (SBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was observed among PRKCH rs2230500 genotypes after 4-week amlodipine or telmisartan therapy (p > 0.05). However, when compared with carriers or GG genotype, the antihypertensive effect of PRKCH rs2230500 GA/AA carriers was superior in telmisartan treatment group. PRKCH rs2230500 gene polymorphism is significantly related to the efficiency in telmisartan therapy (p = 0.02). The PRKCH rs2230500 may influence the antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan in Chinese EH patients, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been implicated in the pathology of osteoarthritis (OA). Nevertheless, the precise actions of circRNA protein kinase C eta (circ-PRKCH, hsa_circ_0032131) on OA pathogenesis are still undiscovered. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using Cell Counting-8 Kit (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The levels of circ-PRKCH, microRNA (miR)-140- 3p and a-disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) mRNA were tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Targeted interplays among circ- PRKCH, miR-140-3p and ADAM10 were verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. circ-PRKCH was up-regulated in OA tissues and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked C-28/I2 cells. circ-PRKCH knockdown alleviated LPS-evoked cell injury and extracellular matrix (ECM) loss in C-28/I2 cells. Mechanistically, circ-PRKCH acted as a miR-140-3p sponge. Moreover, the silencing of circ-PRKCH exerted a protective role in LPS-evoked C-28/I2 cells by up-regulating miR-140-3p. ADAM10 was a direct target of miR- 140-3p, and miR-140-3p overexpression mitigated LPS-evoked C-28/I2 cell injury and ECM loss by down-regulating ADAM10. Furthermore, circ-PRKCH mediated ADAM10 expression via sponging miR-140-3p in C-28/I2 cells. Our present study suggested that circ-PRKCH silencing alleviated LPSevoked chondrocyte injury and ECM loss partially through the miR-140-3p/ADAM10 axis.
BACKGROUND: Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori do not necessarily develop gastric atrophy (GA) and gastric cancer (GC). Several factors, including genetic polymorphism, can regulate the development of GA and GC. A G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs3783799) of the PRKCH gene, which encodes the eta isozyme of protein kinase C (PKCeta), has been reported to be a tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the PRKCH gene linked to a functional 1425G/A SNP in exon 9 (rs2230500). To elucidate its applicability in the development of GA and GC, this study aimed to investigate the associations of the PRKCH polymorphism with the risks of GA and GC. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 583 patients (cases) from first-visit outpatients at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, aged 27 to 80 years, who were diagnosed as having GC from 2001 to 2005, and 1742 controls, frequency-matched for age and sex. Anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies and pepsinogens (PGs) in serum were measured for 1638 controls. RESULTS: Of the 1638 controls, 57.3% were seropositive and 33.0% had GA (PG1 < or = 70 ng/dl and PG1/PG2 < or = 3). When compared to the seronegative controls without GA, the AA genotype was significantly associated with severe GA (PG1 < or = 30 ng/dl and PG1/PG2 < or = 2); odds ratio (OR), 2.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.11-5.05) relative to the GG genotype. The genotype was not associated with the risk of GC. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to examine the associations of the PRKCH polymorphism with GA and GC, and suggested that the AA genotype, relative to the G/G genotype, may be a higher risk genotype for severe GA.
BACKGROUND: The SNP (rs2230500) in PRKCH (the gene encoding protein kinase C eta) is associated with ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage in the Chinese population, but the molecular mechanisms are not clear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between the SNP and atherosclerosis that is common pathological basis of ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the associations of the SNP with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), atherosclerosis diagnosed by CIMT, and factors related with inflammation in the Beijing Child Blood Pressure Study. A total of 1190 subjects participated in the follow-up study. The SNP was genotyped by allele-specific real-time PCR assay. The SNP (rs2230500) in PRKCH was significantly associated with CIMT (in far wall of left common carotid arteries, P = 0.016; in far wall of right common carotid arteries, P = 0.012) under a recessive model after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, and hypertension. The SNP was also significantly associated with complement C3 (P = 0.012) under a dominant model after adjustment for age, gender, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide evidence that the SNP (rs2230500) in PRKCH decreases the risk of CIMT that is a worthwhile predictor of stroke and complement system possibly mediates this process.
AIMS: Meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH (the gene encoding for protein kinase C eta) and ischemic stroke among Chinese and Japanese populations. METHODS: The databases of MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WANFANG DATA until September 2011 were searched for published case-control studies on 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and ischemic stroke. Strict selection criteria and exclusion criteria were determined, and pooled odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed or random effects model to determine the strength of the genetic association. The publication bias was further evaluated by calculating the fail-safe number in the included studies. RESULTS: Five studies, comprising 3686 cases and 4589 controls, passed all the criteria and therefore were included in the meta-analysis. Test for heterogeneity showed that P values (P=0.76, 0.24, respectively) in the two meta-analyses were both greater than 0.05, therefore the fixed effects model was performed. Statistically significant association between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and ischemic stroke was identified (OR=1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.47), and the association was even stronger between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and lacunar infarction (OR=1.44; 95% CI, 1.28-1.63). The fail-safe number (N(fs 0.05)) for 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH with ischemic stroke and lacunar infarction was 59 and 44, respectively, which were greater than the number of studies included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: SNP 1425G/A in PRKCH was associated with ischemic stroke, particularly lacunar infarction, in Chinese and Japanese populations. More studies of different subtypes of stroke need to be done to confirm the results in other Asian populations.
The aim of the present study was to assess the influences of PRKCH gene variants (1425G/A and _15) on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese population. Our study population consisted of 470 CAD patients and 434 control subjects. The alleles frequencies of the two variants were significantly higher among CAD patients than control subjects (P = 0.001 for 1425G/A and P = 0.001 for _15, respectively). In the CAD group, the A allele carriers of 1425G/A and _15 polymorphisms had higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels than homozygote G allele carriers (P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively). In a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), etc., a markedly increased risk of developing CAD was found in subjects carrying GA or AA genotype (P = 0.005 and P = 0.018, respectively). In conclusion, we observed that there was a remarkable association of minor alleles (1425G/A and _15) in the PRKCH gene with an elevated risk of CAD and increased levels of LDL-C in this Chinese population.
Genetic factors have been widely considered to have a substantial effect on the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the four newly discovered polymorphisms in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis confer susceptibility to RA in a Chinese Han population. We conducted a case-control study involving 359 RA cases and 873 age-and gender-matched controls and performed genotyping of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs227163, rs726288, rs3783782 and rs2469434, using the dye terminator-based SNaPshot method. Consequently, we detected significant differences of genotype distribution of rs3783782 in PRKCH between RA and controls. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of rs3783782 were significantly higher in RA patients compared to control subjects. Moreover, the rs227163 in TNFRSF9 had higher MAFs in male RA compared with male controls. In addition, the polymorphism of rs3783782 in PRKCH was significantly associated with RA susceptibility (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.32-2.11, p = 1.32 x 10(-5)). After stratification by gender, the minor (A) allele was strongly associated with increased risk for RA in males (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.34-2.60; p = 1.62 x 10(-4)) and in females (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.08-2.10; p = 0.014). For rs227163, the minor (C) allele was found to be associated with RA risk only in males (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02-1.75; p = 0.036). These findings for the first time confirmed that rs3783782 in PRKCH was associated with RA susceptibility in a Chinese population, and rs227163 in TNFRSF9 was associated with RA risk in Chinese males; these SNPs may serve as genetic markers for RA.
Previous studies suggested an association between 1425G/A polymorphism in PRKCH and stroke risk, but the results were inconsistent. To obtain a more precise estimation, we carried out a meta-analysis to analyze the effect of 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH on stroke risk. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG Data for all eligible case-control studies through April 2014. The odds ratios (ORs), together with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated to evaluate the strength of association between 1425G/A SNP and stroke risk. Overall, seven eligible studies involving a total of 4,574 cases and 5,471 controls were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that the variant genotypes of 1425G/A polymorphism in PRKCH were significantly associated with a higher risk of stroke in all genetic models (GA vs. GG: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.24-1.47, P < 0.001; AA vs. GG: OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.24-1.82, P < 0.001; GA/AA vs. GG: OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.26-1.49, P < 0.001; AA vs. GA/GG: OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.62, P = 0.002; A vs. G: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21-1.39, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, significantly increased risks were also observed for ischemic stroke, larger sample size (>1,000) and population-based studies. The result of our meta-analysis indicated that the 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH may contribute to susceptibility of stroke, especially for ischemic stroke.
Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the first-line treatment for Philadelphia (Ph) chromosomal positive leukemia by inhibiting phosphorylation of substrates via binding to the ABL kinase domain. Because of the drug resistance, side effects and the high cost of IM, it is necessary to find anti-cancer drugs with relatively low toxicity and cost, and enhanced efficacy, such as traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). As one of TCMs, Huai Qi Huang (HQH) was chosen to treat BV173 and K562 cells. Various concentrations of HQH were added to cells for 24-72 h. Co-treatment of HQH and trametinib, an MEK inhibitor, was used to verify the synergistic effects on cell viability and apoptosis. Knockdown and overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MEK4) were implemented to demonstrate the role of MEK in cell apoptosis. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK8) and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to assess protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. The results showed that HQH inhibited survival and promoted apoptosis of BV173 and K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied with down-regulation of PRKCH mRNA as well as CRAF, MEK4, phospho-ERK (pERK) and BCL2 proteins, and up-regulation of cleaved caspase3 protein. Co-treatment of HQH and trametinib had a synergistic effect on inhibiting survival and promoting apoptosis. MEK4 knockdown increased apoptosis, and had a synergistic effect with HQH. In contrast, MEK4 overexpression decreased apoptosis, and had the opposite effect with HQH. Collectively, the results of this study may identify a therapeutic mechanism of HQH on promoting apoptosis, and provide a potential option for treatment of Ph(+) leukemia.
MicroRNA (miRNA) may function as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of miRNAs in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that miR-24-3p was downreglated and functions as a tumor suppressor in human lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma by suppressing proliferation and migration/invasion while promoting apoptosis. miR-24-3p down-regulated protein kinase C eta (PRKCH) by binding to its untranslated region (3'UTR). PRKCH increased the of the cell growth and migration/invasion in ACC cells and suppressed the expression of p53 and p21 in both mRNA and protein level. The overexpression of miR-24-3p decreased its malignant phenotype. Ectopic expression of PRKCH counteracted the suppression of malignancy induced by miR-24-3p, as well as ectopic expression of miR-24-3p rescued the suppression of PRKCH in the p53/p21 pathway. These results suggest that miR-24-3p promotes the p53/p21 pathway by down-regulating PRKCH expression in lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma cells.
BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have elucidated that the 1425G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2230500 single-nucleotide polymorphism) in exon 9 of the protein kinase C eta (PRKCH) gene is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke: stroke incidence is significantly higher in the subjects with AA than those with AG or GG genotype. However, its impact on stroke recurrence remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the polymorphism is also a risk factor for recurrent stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We enrolled 2418 consecutive patients with acute and first-ever ischemic stroke and investigated the 1425G/A polymorphism of PRKCH. Patients were followed up for a median of 733 days. The association between the polymorphism and stroke recurrence was investigated using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: In the enrolled patients, the GG genotype was the most prevalent (63%), followed by AG (32%) and AA genotypes (5%). Recurrent stroke occurred in 302 patients during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed no difference in the rate of recurrent stroke after first-ever stroke among the 3 genotypes. The incidence of recurrent stroke was not significantly different in patients with AA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval .59-1.64, P=.94) or AG (HR .89, 95% confidence interval .69-1.14, P=.36) genotypes compared with those with the GG genotype after adjusting for multiple confounders. CONCLUSIONS: The 1425G/A polymorphism in PRKCH is not a significant predictor of stroke recurrence in patients with acute ischemic stroke during a 2-year follow-up period.
