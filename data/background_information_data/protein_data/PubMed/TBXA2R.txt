Thromboxane A2 receptor; Receptor for thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation. The activity of this receptor is mediated by a G- protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. In the kidney, the binding of TXA2 to glomerular TP receptors causes intense vasoconstriction. Activates phospholipase C. Isoform 1 activates adenylyl cyclase. Isoform 2 inhibits adenylyl cyclase.
Abstract Regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) which change the transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS) for transcriptional factors (TFs) to bind DNA were reviewed for the ADRBK1 (GRK2), AKT3, ATF3, DIO2, TBXA2R and VEGFA genes. Changes in the TFBS where TFs attach to regulate these genes may result in human sickness and disease. The highlights of this previous work were reviewed for these genes.
Platelet activity is regulated by a number of surface expressed G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including the alpha isoform of the thromboxane receptor (TPalpha receptor). With the advance of genomic technologies, there has been a substantial increase in the identification of naturally occurring rare GPCR variants including in the TBXA2R gene, which encodes the TPalpha receptor. The study of patients with naturally occurring variants within TBXA2R associated with bleeding and abnormal TPalpha receptor function has provided a powerful insight in defining the critical role of TPalpha in thrombus formation. This review will highlight how the identification of these function-disrupting variants of the platelet TPalpha has contributed important structure-function information about these GPCRs. Further we discuss the potential implications these findings have for understanding the molecular basis of mild platelet based bleeding disorders.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is defined by the lack of ERalpha, PR expression and HER2 overexpression and is the breast cancer subtype with the poorest clinical outcomes. Our aim was to identify genes driving TNBC proliferation and/or survival which could represent novel therapeutic targets.We performed microarray profiling of primary TNBCs and generated differential genelists based on clinical outcomes following the chemotherapy regimen FEC (5-Fluorouracil/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide -'good' outcome no relapse > 3 years; 'poor' outcome relapse < 3 years). Elevated expression of thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) was observed in 'good' outcome TNBCs. TBXA2R expression was higher specifically in TNBC cell lines and TBXA2R knockdowns consistently showed dramatic cell killing in TNBC cells. TBXA2R mRNA and promoter activities were up-regulated following BRCA1 knockdown, with c-Myc being required for BRCA1-mediated transcriptional repression.We demonstrated that TBXA2R enhanced TNBC cell migration, invasion and activated Rho signalling, phenotypes which could be reversed using Rho-associated Kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. TBXA2R also protected TNBC cells from DNA damage by negatively regulating reactive oxygen species levels. In summary, TBXA2R is a novel breast cancer-associated gene required for the survival and migratory behaviour of a subset of TNBCs and could provide opportunities to develop novel, more effective treatments.
BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a common cause of death and disability throughout the world. We aimed to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in TBXA2R (rs4523, rs768963, rs1131882), P2Y12 (rs204693), ADD1 (rs4961) and risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS: A comprehensive retrieval with the databases of Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, CNKI and Wan fang data was conducted. The deadline was February 1, 2019. Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were calculated by using the Z-test. Heterogeneity between the included studies was tested using the I2 method. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's linear regression were used to evaluate the publication bias. Software STATA 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for the meta-analysis and 26 studies with 5,776 cases and 8,025 controls were included. RESULTS: The results indicated significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke associated with TBXA2R variant rs768963 in all genetic models (C vs T: OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.13-1.42, P.
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. It is well known that genetic variability contributes to asthma risk. One of the most replicated asthma candidate genes is ORM1-like 3 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (ORMDL3), which has been associated with childhood asthma susceptibility. Another asthma candidate gene is signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), a regulator of IgE class switching. Gene coding thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R), involved in chronic airway inflammation, has been associated with asthma in several genetic studies. We have studied the association of polymorphism rs4795405 in ORMDL3, rs324011 in STAT6 as well as rs8113232 and rs3786989 in TBXA2R with asthma risk, various asthma phenotypes and asthma-related symptoms. The study group consisted of 154 children with asthma, in whom clinical parameters were measured and whose asthma control and atopic status were determined. A control group comprised 71 healthy children. Genotyping was performed using an allelic discrimination assay. The ORMDL3 polymorphism rs4795405 was suggestively associated with asthma risk. Furthermore, it was significantly associated with nonatopic asthma and asthma without rhinitis. No association was detected between the STAT6 polymorphism rs324011 or the TBXA2R polymorphisms rs8113232 and rs3786989 and asthma susceptibility. However, an association between rs324011 in STAT6 with recurrent wheezing in early childhood and a suggestive association between rs8113232 in TBXA2R with rhinitis in children with asthma were observed. Our results confirmed ORMDL3 as a candidate gene for childhood asthma susceptibility. STAT6 and TBXA2R polymorphisms were not associated with asthma risk, but they were associated with asthma-related symptoms.
BACKGROUND: Thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) gene polymorphism has been associated with atopy and asthma, but few studies have reported the effect of this gene polymorphism on asthma-related phenotype or responsiveness to leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in asthmatic children. This study investigated associations between asthma-related phenotypes and TBXA2R polymorphism, and also analysed whether the TBXA2R polymorphism has an effect on the efficacy of the LTRA, montelukast, in asthmatic children with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). METHODS: Asthmatic children (n=695) and control children (n=159) were evaluated for asthma-related phenotypes including total IgE, pulmonary function test, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine or exercise. Genotypes were detected by PCR-RFLP. In the montelukast study, exercise challenge was performed before and after an 8-week montelukast treatment. RESULTS: The TBXA2R polymorphism was not associated with asthma susceptibility and the clinical parameters of asthma. However, asthmatic children with combinations of the TBXA2R+795T>C and +924T>C risk alleles had significantly higher total IgE levels (P=0.01), total eosinophil counts (P<0.01) and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) (P=0.02) and forced expiratory rates at 25-75% of vital capacity (P=0.02) than those carrying the common alleles. When compared with individuals with the common alleles, patients with the TBXA2R+924T>C TT homozygote and TBXA2R+795T>C hetero- or homozygote (CT or CC) had a 3.67-fold poor response to 8-week montelukast treatment with respect to maximum percent fall in FEV(1) after exercise (odds ratio, 3.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-11.15). CONCLUSIONS: A combined effect of TBXA2R+795T>C and +924T>C risk alleles may be linked to IgE production, eosinophilic inflammation, and severity of asthma. In addition, the TBXA2R+795T>C genotype may be a predictive marker of a clinical response to the LTRA in Korean asthmatic children with EIB.
INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of asthma is increasing steadily among general population in developing countries over past two decades. One of the causative agents of broncho-constriction in asthma is thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R). However few studies of TBXA2R polymorphism were performed so far. The present study aimed to assess potential association of TBXA2R rs34377097 polymorphism causing missense substitution of Arginine to Leucine (R60L) among 482 patients diagnosed with pollen-induced asthma and 122 control participants from West Bengal, India. Also we performed in-silico analysis of mutated TBXA2R protein (R60L) using homology modeling. METHODS: Clinical parameters like Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), FEV(1)/Forced vital capacity (FVC) and Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were assessed using spirometry. Patients' sensitivity was measured by skin prick test (SPT) against 16 pollen allergens. Polymerase chain reaction-based Restriction fragment length polymorphism was done for genotyping. Structural model of wild type and homology model of polymorphic TBXA2R was generated using AlphaFold2 and MODELLER respectively. Electrostatic surface potential was calculated using APBS plugin in PyMol. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies differed significantly between the study groups (P=0.03). There was no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control population (chi2=1.56). Asthmatic patients have significantly higher frequency of rs34377097TT genotype than control subjects (P=0.03). SPT of patients showed maximum sensitivity in A. indica (87.68%) followed by C. nusifera (83.29%) and C. pulcherima (74.94%). Significant difference existed for pollen sensitivity in adolescent and young adult (P=0.01) and between young and old adult (P=0.0003). Significant negative correlation was found between FEV1/FVC ratio and intensity of SPT reactions (P<0.0001). Significant association of FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC and PEFR was observed with pollen-induced asthma. Furthermore, risk allele T was found to be clinically correlated with lower FEV(1)/FVC ratio (P=0.015) in patients. Our data showed R60L polymorphism, which was conserved across mammals, significantly reduced positive electrostatic charge of polymorphic protein in cytoplasmic domain thus altered downstream pathway and induced asthma response. DISCUSSION: The present in-silico study is the first one to report association of TBXA2R rs34377097 polymorphism in an Indian population. It may be used as prognostic marker of clinical response to asthma in West Bengal and possible target of therapeutics in future.
Kawasaki disease is a multi-system vasculitis and a primary cause of acquired heart disease among children. Genetic factors may increase susceptibility to Kawasaki disease. TBXA2R is a G-protein-coupled receptor that participates in tissue inflammation and is associated with susceptibility to several diseases, but its relevance in Kawasaki disease is unclear. We genotyped TBXA2R (rs1131882 and rs4523) in 694 Kawasaki disease cases and 657 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the intensity of the associations. We found a significantly decreased risk of Kawasaki disease associated with TBXA2R rs4523 G variant genotypes (AG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.788, 95%CI = 0.626-0.993; GG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.459, 95%CI = 0.258-0.815; AG/GG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.744, 95%CI = 0.595-0.929; GG vs AG/AA: adjusted OR = 0.497, 95% CI = 0.281-0.879). In the combined analysis of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we found that individuals with two unfavorable genotypes exhibited decreased risk for Kawasaki disease (adjusted OR = 0.754, 95%CI = 0.577-0.985) compared with those who did not have or one unfavorable genotypes. This cumulative effect on protection is effect-genotype dose-dependent (p(trend) = 0.022). Moreover, the combined analysis indicated that the two unfavorable genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of Kawasaki disease in children 12-60 months of age, females and the subgroup with non-coronary artery lesion (NCAL) formation compared with those who did not have or one unfavorable genotypes. In conclusion, the TBXA2R rs4523 G allele may contribute to protection against Kawasaki disease and decreased risk of coronary artery aneurysm complications in a southern Chinese population.
BACKGROUND: The thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) is a potent broncho- and vaso-constrictor and is associated with leukotriene synthesis. Polymorphisms in the TBXA2R gene have been linked to atopy, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. This study evaluated the association between genetic TBXA2R variants and the development of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA)-intolerant acute urticaria (AIAU). METHODS: AIAU patients (n=167), ASA-intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU) patients (n=149), and healthy controls (NC) (n=265) were included. All patients were enrolled at Ajou University Hospital in Suwon, Korea. Two TBXA2R polymorphisms (-4684T>C and 795T>C) were genotyped by primer extension using a SNAPshot ddNTP primer extension kit. Luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using a nuclear extract from a human mast cell line (HMC-1). RESULTS: Genetic association data demonstrated that compared with NC subjects, AIAU patients had a significantly higher frequency of the homozygous TT genotype of TBXA2R-4684T>C (P=0.005, P(corr) =0.03). No differences were identified between the AICU and the NC groups. Luciferase activity, reflecting promoter activity, was significantly lower with the TBXA2R-4684T-containing construct than with the -4684C-containing construct (P<0.001); the activity decreased further upon co-transfection with ETS-like gene transcription factor-1 (ELK-1) (P=0.012). EMSA revealed that the -4684T allele produced a specific shifted band, with a greater affinity than that produced by the -4684C allele. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results suggest that the TBXA2R-4684T allele may be associated with lower TBXA2R expression, which may contribute to the development of the AIAU phenotype.
AIM: Aspirin resistance has an incidence of 5%-65% in patients with ischemic stroke, who receive the standard dose of aspirin, but the platelet function is inadequately inhibited, thereby leading to thrombotic events. Numerous evidence shows that thromboxane A(2) receptor (TXA(2) receptor, encoded by TBXA2R), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2), encoded by PLA2G7) and platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1 (PEAR1, encoded by PEAR1) are crucial in regulating platelet activation, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by MDR1) influences the absorption of aspirin in the intestine. In this study we examined the correlation between MDR1, TBXA2R, PLA2G7, PEAR1 genetic polymorphisms and platelet activity in Chinese ischemic stroke patients receiving aspirin therapy. METHODS: A total of 283 ischemic stroke patients receiving 100 mg aspirin for 7 d were genotyped for polymorphisms in MDR1 C3435T, TBXA2R (rs1131882), PLA2G7 (rs1051931, rs7756935), and PEAR1 (rs12566888, rs12041331). The platelet aggregation response was measured using an automatic platelet aggregation analyzer and a commercially available TXB(2) ELISA kit. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (11.66%) were insensitive to aspirin treatment. MDR1 3435TT genotype carriers, whose arachidonic acid (AA) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation was lower than that of CC+CT genotype carriers, were less likely to suffer from aspirin resistance (odds ratio=0.421, 95% CI: 0.233-0.759). The TBXA2R rs1131882 CC genotype, which was found more frequently in the aspirin-insensitive group (81.8% vs 62.4%) than in the sensitive group, was identified as a risk factor for aspirin resistance (odds ratio=2.712, 95% CI: 1.080-6.810) with a higher level of AA-induced platelet aggregation. Due to the combined effects of PLA2G7 rs1051931 and rs7756935, carriers of the AA-CC haplotype had a higher level of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and were at considerably higher risk of aspirin resistance than noncarriers (odds ratio=8.233, 95% CI: 1.590-42.638). CONCLUSION: A considerable portion (11.66%) of Chinese ischemic stroke patients are insensitive to aspirin treatment, which may be correlated with the MDR1 C3435T, TBXA2R (rs1131882), and PLA2G7 (rs1051931-rs7756935) polymorphisms.
The actions of thromboxane A2 as a prostaglandin mediator are dependent on its recently cloned and sequenced receptor. The identification and characterization of DNA polymorphisms in the thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) will advance the study of this gene as a candidate in a number of medical disorders. We amplified a 573-nucleotide fragment of the transcribed 3' untranslated region of the TBXA2R gene using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the published cDNA sequence. This region was found to contain two sequence polymorphisms within an Alu. These DNA polymorphisms were demonstrated using an efficient method of direct solid-phase sequence analysis. Three of the four expected alleles were observed in the CEPH families. TBXA2R was localized to chromosome 19 by PCR amplification in a series of monochoromosomal human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. Linkage mapping places TBXA2R closest to the anonymous marker D19S120, with a maximal LOD = 19.55, at a theta = 0.05 in the CEPH panel of DNAs. Multipoint linkage analysis places TBXA2R between the markers D19S120 and PMS207 on the telomeric end of chromosome 19p13.3.
