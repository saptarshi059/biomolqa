Adenylate cyclase type 2; Catalyzes the formation of the signaling molecule cAMP in response to G-protein signaling. Down-stream signaling cascades mediate changes in gene expression patterns and lead to increased IL6 production. Functions in signaling cascades downstream of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (By similarity). Belongs to the adenylyl cyclase class-4/guanylyl cyclase family.
OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a serious threat to human health. ADCY2 gene polymorphisms may be related to HCC susceptibility. Therefore, we investigated whether ADCY2 gene polymorphisms are correlated to the risk of HCC in a Chinese Han population. METHODS: In a case-control study, we examined the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADCY2 and HCC risk. In 434 HCC cases and 442 healthy controls, we used the Agena MassARRAY platform to select and genotype four tag SNPs in ADCY2. We used logistic regression after adjusting for age and sex to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The results showed that ADCY2 rs10059539 polymorphism was associated with a reduced susceptibility to HCC in women under the dominant model (TC/TT vs. CC; OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.13-0.83; P = 0.018) and the log-additive model (OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.13-0.83; P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that ADCY2 gene polymorphisms influence the genetic susceptibility to HCC.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of endogenous noncoding RNA (ncRNA), exert vital roles in leukemia progression and are promising prognostic factors. Here, we report a novel circRNA, circSLC25A13 (hsa_circ_0081188), which was increased in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with poor overall survival (OS) comparing to patients with good prognosis. Knockdown of circSLC25A13 in AML cells inhibited proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Enhanced circSLC25A13 expression promoted the survival of AML cells. Mechanistically, circSLC25A13 played as a microRNA sponge of miR-616-3p, which inhibited the expression of adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2). Downregulation of miR-616-3p and overexpression of ADCY2 partially rescued circSLC25A13 deficient induced cell growth arrest. In summary, through competitive absorption of miR-616-3p and thereby upregulating ADCY2 expression, circSLC25A13 promoted AML progression. Moreover, circSLC25A13 may represent a potential novel biomarker for the prognosis of AML and offer a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment.
We examined the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or lung function with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in a novel cohort of patients with severe to very severe COPD. We examined 315 cases of COPD and 330 Caucasian control smokers from Poland. We included three SNPs previously associated with COPD: rs7671167 (FAM13A), rs13180 (IREB2), and rs8034191 (CHRNA 3/5), and four SNPs associated with lung function in a genome-wide association study of general population samples: rs2070600 (AGER), rs11134242 (ADCY2), rs4316710 (THSD4), and rs17096090 (INTS12). We tested for associations with severe COPD and COPD-related phenotypes, including lung function, smoking behavior, and body mass index. Subjects with COPD were older (average age 62 versus 58 years, P < 0.01), with more pack-years of smoking (45 versus 33 pack-years, P < 0.01). CHRNA3/5 (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.4; P = 7.4 x 10(-7)), IREB2 (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; P = 3.4 x 10(-3)), and ADCY2 (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; P = 0.01) demonstrated significant associations with COPD. FAM13A (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; P = 0.11) approached statistical significance. FAM13A and ADCY2 also demonstrated a significant association with lung function. Thus, in severe to very severe COPD, we demonstrate a replication of association between two SNPs previously associated with COPD (CHRNA3/5 and IREB2), as well as an association with COPD of one locus initially associated with lung function (ADCY2).
High rates of mortality due to both suicide and medical comorbidities in bipolar patients can be decreased through the administration of lithium, which affects the cerebral endothelium as well as neurons. To investigate the role of ADCY2 in risk of bipolar disorder, we genotyped the ADCY2 rs2290910 in bipolar patients and healthy controls using amplification refractory mutation system PCR. This polymorphism was associated with risk of bipolar disorder (odds ratio [OR]: 0.430; 95% CI: 0.296-0.624; p = 0.001). The C allele was more frequent in suicide ideation group compared other groups (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.386-5.302; p = 0.004). The T allele was more frequent in suicide attempt group compared with suicide ideation group (OR: 0.238; 95% CI: 0.111-0.509; p = 0.001).
AIM: To investigate the expression of markers that are correlated with the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six CRC patients were followed up for more than 3 years after radical surgery. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed to detect the expression of 14 pathway-related markers (p53, APC, p21ras, E-cadherin, endothelin-B receptor, Shp2, ADCY-2, SPARCL1, neuroligin1, hsp27, mmp-9, MAPK, MSH2 and rho) in specimens from these patients. Bioinformatics analysis involving a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to determine the best prognostic model from combinations of these markers. RESULTS: Seven markers (SPARCL1, Shp2, MSH2, E-cadherin, p53, ADCY-2 and MAPK) were significantly related to the prognosis and clinical pathological features of the CRC patients (P < 0.05). Prognostic models were established through SVM from combinations of these 7 markers and proved able to differentiate patients with dissimilar survival, especially in stage II/III patients. According to the best prognostic model, the p53/SPARCL1 model, patients having high p53 and low SPARCL1 expression had about 50% lower 3-year survival than others (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: SPARCL1, Shp2, MSH2, E-cadherin, p53, ADCY-2 and MAPK are potential prognostic markers in CRC. A p53/SPARCL1 bioinformatics model may be used as a supplement to tumor-nodes-metastasis staging.
