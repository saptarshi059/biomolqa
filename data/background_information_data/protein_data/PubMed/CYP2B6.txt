Cytochrome P450 2B6; A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of endocannabinoids and steroids. Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH-- hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15- epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling. Hydroxylates steroid hormon [...] 
Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; i.e., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (i.e., desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, and venlafaxine), and serotonin modulators with SSRI-like properties (i.e., vilazodone and vortioxetine) are primary pharmacologic treatments for major depressive and anxiety disorders. Genetic variation in CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 influences the metabolism of many of these antidepressants, which may potentially affect dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. In addition, the pharmacodynamic genes SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) and HTR2A (serotonin-2A receptor) have been examined in relation to efficacy and side effect profiles of these drugs. This guideline updates and expands the 2015 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and SSRI dosing and summarizes the impact of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, SLC6A4, and HTR2A genotypes on antidepressant dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. We provide recommendations for using CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 genotype results to help inform prescribing these antidepressants and describe the existing data for SLC6A4 and HTR2A, which do not support their clinical use in antidepressant prescribing.
Human CYP2B6 enzyme although constitutes relatively low proportion (1-4%) of hepatic cytochrome P450 content, it is the major catalyst of metabolism of several clinically important drugs (efavirenz, cyclophosphamide, bupropion, methadone). High interindividual variability in CYP2B6 function, contributing to impaired drug-response and/or adverse reactions, is partly elucidated by genetic polymorphisms, whereas non-genetic factors can significantly modify the CYP2B6 phenotype. The influence of genetic and phenoconverting non-genetic factors on CYP2B6-selective activity and CYP2B6 expression was investigated in liver tissues from Caucasian subjects (N = 119). Strong association was observed between hepatic S-mephenytoin N-demethylase activity and CYP2B6 mRNA expression (P < 0.0001). In less than one third of the tissue donors, the CYP2B6 phenotype characterized by S-mephenytoin N-demethylase activity and/or CYP2B6 expression was concordant with CYP2B6 genotype, whereas in more than 35% of the subjects, an altered CYP2B6 phenotype was attributed to phenoconverting non-genetic factors (to CYP2B6-specific inhibitors and inducers, non-specific amoxicillin + clavulanic acid treatment and chronic alcohol consumption, but not to the gender). Furthermore, CYP2B6 genotype-phenotype mismatch still existed in one third of tissue donors. In conclusion, identifying potential sources of CYP2B6 variability and considering both genetic variations and non-genetic factors is a pressing requirement for appropriate elucidation of CYP2B6 genotype-phenotype mismatch.
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine (BZD) used worldwide for a variety of conditions. Long-term use of diazepam increases the risk for developing tolerance and dependence and for the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 mainly metabolize diazepam and are therefore the primary pharmacogenetic candidate biomarkers. In this work, we aimed to explore the impact of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 phenotypes and of 99 additional variants in other 31 pharmacogenes (including other CYP, UGT, NAT2 and CES enzymes, ABC and SLC transporters) on diazepam pharmacokinetic variability and safety. 30 healthy volunteers that had participated in a single-dose bioequivalence clinical trial of two diazepam formulations were enrolled in the present candidate gene pharmacogenetic study. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) showed an almost 2-fold increase in AUC(0-infinity/)DW compared to rapid (RMs) or normal (NM) metabolizers, and a 1.46-fold increase compared to intermediate metabolizers (IMs). CYP2B6 PMs showed a 2,74-fold higher AUC(0-infinity)/DW compared to RMs, and 2.10-fold compared to NMs (p < 0.007). A dose reduction of 25-50 % may be appropriate for CYP2C19 or CYP2B6 PMs to avoid ADRs, dependence and tolerance. Combined CYP2C19 +CYP2B6 PMs may not use diazepam or sharper dose adjustments (e.g., a dose reduction of 50-70 %) may be advisable. To our knowledge, this is the first work to report a strong relationship between CYP2B6 phenotype and diazepam pharmacokinetics. Additional nominal associations (i.e., 0.007 <p < 0.05) between ABCG2, ABCB1, NAT2 and UGT1A4 polymorphisms and pharmacokinetic variability were observed; further research should elaborate on the clinical relevance of the described associations.
BACKGROUND: CYP2B6 (cytochrome P450 subfamily IIB polypeptide 6), encoded by the CYP2B6 gene, is a critical enzyme involved in clopidogrel metabolism. However, the association between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and the efficacy of clopidogrel in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack for secondary stroke prevention remains unclear. METHODS: Based on CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) randomized clinical trial of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone, we investigated the role of CYP2B6 polymorphisms and the efficacy of clopidogrel in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack in China from October 2009 to July 2012. A total of 2853 patients were successfully genotyped for CYP2B6-516G>T, rs3745274 and CYP2B6-1456 T>C, rs2054675. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were new stroke and any bleeding within 90 days. RESULTS: Among the 2853 patients, 32.8% were identified as the carriers of the CYP2B6-516 GT/TT or -1456 TC/CC genotype. The incidences of 90-day new stroke in aspirin plus clopidogrel and aspirin alone groups were 7.1% versus 11.3% among noncarriers, respectively; and 9.7% versus 12.2% among carriers, respectively. The efficacy of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone was not significantly different (P interaction=0.29) in noncarriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.45-0.83]) compared to carriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.54-1.18]). The incidence (n=51) of 90-day any bleeding in aspirin plus clopidogrel and aspirin alone groups were 2.2% (21 bleeds) versus 1.9% (18 bleeds) among noncarriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.59-2.09]) and 1.9% (9 bleeds) versus 0.7% (3 bleeds) among carriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.23 [95% CI, 0.86-12.12]). Similar findings were observed during the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this post hoc analysis of the CHANCE trial, we did not observe a significant difference in the efficacy of aspirin plus clopidogrel compared with aspirin in carriers versus noncarriers of CYP2B6-516 GT/TT or -1456 TC/CC genotype. Our results suggest that both carriers and noncarriers suffering from a minor stroke are likely to benefit from aspirin plus clopidogrel treatment over aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention.

BACKGROUND: The human CYP2B subfamily consists of one functional gene (CYP2B6) and one pseudogene (CYP2B7P). Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) is a highly polymorphic enzyme that shows marked interindividual and interethnic variations. Currently, 38 alleles have been described, and some of the allelic variants have been associated with low enzyme activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequencies of CYP2B6( *)4, CYP2B6( *)5, and CYP2B6( *)6 alleles in the Mazani ethnic group among Iranian Population. METHODS: The study was conducted in 289 unrelated healthy volunteers. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and analyzed by the PCR-RFLP protocol. The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes and then separated using agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The frequency of CYP2B6( *)4, CYP2B6( *)5, and CYP2B6( *)6 in this study was 34.60%, 7.26%, and 34.54%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The frequency of the CYP2B6( *)4 allele in the Mazani ethnic group was much higher (34.60%) than other population. The frequency of CYP2B6( *)6 (34.54%) also was higher than its frequency in other previously reported population. But the frequency of CYP2B6( *)5 in this study was lower than expected. These results will be useful in understanding the ethnic diversity in Iranian population and offer a preliminary basis for more rational use of drugs that are substrates for CYP2B6 in this population.
BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir is associated with more weight gain than efavirenz. Loss-of-function polymorphisms in CYP2B6 result in higher efavirenz concentrations, which we hypothesized would impair weight gain among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) starting efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: We studied ART-naive participants from the ADVANCE study randomized to the efavirenz /emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and dolutegravir/emtricitabine/TDF arms. We compared changes in weight and regional fat on DXA from baseline to week 48 between CYP2B6 metabolizer genotypes in the efavirenz arm, and with the dolutegravir arm. RESULTS: There were 342 participants in the dolutegravir arm and 168 in the efavirenz arm who consented to genotyping. Baseline characteristics were similar. Weight gain was greater in women than men. In the efavirenz arm CYP2B6 metaboliser genotype was associated with weight gain (P = .009), with extensive metabolizers gaining the most weight, and with changes in regional fat in women, but not in men. Weight gain was similar in CYP2B6 extensive metabolizers in the efavirenz arm and in the dolutegravir arm (P = .836). The following variables were independently associated with weight gain in all participants: baseline CD4 count, baseline human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA, and CYP2B6 metaboliser genotype. CONCLUSIONS: CYP2B6 metaboliser genotype was associated with weight gain in PLWH starting efavirenz-based ART. Weight gain was similar between CYP2B6 extensive metabolizers in the efavirenz arm and in the dolutegravir arm, suggesting that impaired weight gain among CYP2B6 slow or intermediate metabolizers could explain the increased weight gain on dolutegravir compared with efavirenz observed in ADVANCE and other studies.
INTRODUCTION: Bupropion is metabolized to its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (HB), by the genetically polymorphic cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) enzyme. Despite its significant role in bupropion metabolism, the magnitude of the impact of CYP2B6 genotype on the exposure of bupropion has not been quantified. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the association of bupropion and HB exposure with CYP2B6 variant alleles and genotype-defined metabolizer phenotypes. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scifinder, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL were screened to identify studies that met the following inclusion criteria (search updated on February 2021): (1) area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of bupropion and/or HB in relation to CYP2B6 genotypes was studied, and (2) study participants were genotyped for common CYP2B6 variant alleles including at least CYP2B6*6. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias in each included study. The ratio of means (RoM) between CYP2B6 genotype or genotype-defined phenotype groups for bupropion exposure was calculated for each study and combined in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, and 10 (including N = 413 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. All 10 studies involved healthy adult volunteers, where other medications were not allowed. The AUCs of HB and the active moiety (bupropion + HB) were significantly reduced in CYP2B6*6 carriers compared with the non-carriers (HB: RoM 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.83; active moiety: RoM 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.88). Both CYP2B6 poor and intermediate metabolizers had significantly decreased exposures to HB and the active moiety than normal metabolizers. CONCLUSION: The CYP2B6*6 allele and genotype-determined CYP2B6 poor and intermediate metabolizer phenotypes are associated with significantly lower exposures to HB and the total active moiety. The findings of this study suggest opportunities to further study precision dosing strategies for bupropion therapy based on CYP2B6 genotype.
We present a case with important pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic aspects of antiretroviral therapy in a patient with high efavirenz concentrations, severe CNS side-effects and low lopinavir concentrations. Despite therapeutic drug monitoring and subsequent efavirenz dosage reductions, side-effects did not resolve completely and lopinavir concentrations remained relatively low.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 polymorphisms on the virological and immunologic responses of HIV patients. A total of 153 HIV-positive patients were enlisted for the study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Viral load and median CD4 T cell counts were evaluated at baseline and month 6 (M6). Samples were identified using TaqMan genotyping assays. RESULTS: The AG in CYP2B6 rs2279343 was associated with VLS compared to homozygous AA. In the dominant model, the AG/GG genotypes were associated with VLS compared to the AA genotype. Moreover, in overdominant model, the AG genotype was associated with VLS compared to AA/GG. Regarding immunological response, only the AG in SNP rs2279343 CYP2B6 was associated with an increase in CD4 cell count between baseline and M6. In CYP2B6 rs3745274, the CD4 cell count at M6 was higher than that of baseline for GG carriers and for GT carriers. In CYP3A4 rs2740574, the TC carriers showed a higher median CD4 count at M6 compared to that of the baseline count, as well as for CC carriers. The best genotypes combination associated with CD4 cell count improvement were AA/AG in SNP rs2279343 and GG/GT in SNP rs3745274. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the fact that CYP2B6 rs2279343 could help in the prediction of VLS and both SNPs rs3745274 and rs2279343 in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 rs2740574 were associated with immune recovery in Malian HIV-positive patients.
Some individuals have higher efavirenz plasma concentrations during rifampin-containing tuberculosis (TB) therapy, contrary to the expected induction effect of rifampin. Among HIV-infected patients without (n = 38) and with TB on rifampin-containing therapy (n = 18), we tested the hypothesis that drug-gene interaction may explain the highly variable drug interactions. Two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between CYP2B6 516G-->T polymorphism and rifampin-containing therapy, suggesting that efavirenz dose adjustment may need to be individualized on the basis of the patient's genotype.
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of solid and haematological malignancies and as an immunosuppressive agent. As a prodrug, it is dependent on bioactivation to the active phosphoramide mustard metabolite to elicit its therapeutic effect. This focused review will highlight the evidence for the role of germline pharmacogenetic variation in both plasma pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. There is a substantial indication from 13 pharmacokinetic and 17 therapeutic outcome studies, in contexts as diverse as haematological malignancy, breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus and myeloablation, that pharmacogenetic variation in both CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 influence the bioactivation of cyclophosphamide. An additional role for pharmacogenetic variation in ALDH1A1 has also been reported. Future studies should comprehensively assess these 3 pharmacogenes and undertake appropriate statistical analysis of gene-gene interactions to confirm these findings and may allow personalised treatment regimens.
BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 complex plays a key role in drug metabolism. CYP2B6 has an essential part in Cytochrome P450 complex metabolism. This study aims to determine the allelic distribution of CYP2B6( *)2 and CYP2B6( *)3 in three main Iranian ethnicities: Fars, Turk, and Kurd. METHODS: The study was conducted on 174 unrelated healthy volunteers from three main Iranian ethnicities. After DNA extraction from peripheral blood samples, genotyping of CYP2B6( *)2 and ( *)3 was performed using tetra ARMS and ARMS PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The average age of 174 cases was 40.69 +/- 11.87 (mean +/- SD) and 39.06 +/- 11.63 (mean +/- SD) for males and females. In the CYP2B6( *)2 variant, the genotyping frequency of wild type (C/C), heterozygous (C/T), and homozygous mutant (T/T) was 8.7%, 86%, and 5.2%, respectively. The CYP2B6( *)2 (c.64C > T) allele frequency was 48.2% (95% CI: (37.8-58.6)). In the CYP2B6( *)3 variant, the frequency of wild type (C/C), heterozygous (C/T), and homozygous mutant (T/T) was 75.3%, 11%, and 13.6%, respectively. The CYP2B6( *)3 (c.777C > A) allelic frequency was 19.1% (95% CI: (17.5-20.7)). CONCLUSION: Allelic distribution in three main Iranian ethnicities, i.e., Turk, Kurd, and Fars, is remarkably higher than that in other populations, even that in Southern Iran. High frequencies of CYP2B6( *)2 and ( *)3 in the Iranian population highly affect drug responsiveness. Understanding such variability could help to increase drug efficacy and reduce its toxicity.
AIMS: Our study aimed to evaluate the impacts of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6-G516T and CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms on pharmacokinetic and clinical parameters in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment. METHODS: Opioid PhArmacoLogy (OPAL) was a clinical survey of the sociodemographic characteristics, history and consequences of pathology associated with methadone maintenance treatment response and current addictive comorbidities. A subgroup of 72 methadone patients was genotyped. RESULTS: When comparing the three CYP2B6 genotype groups, the methadone (R)- and (S)-methadone enantiomer concentrations/doses (concentrations relative to doses) were different (P = .029, P = .0019). The CYP2D6 phenotypes did not seem to be relevant with regard to methadone levels. On multivariate analysis, neither the CYP2B6 genotype nor the CYP2D6 phenotype explained the (R)-methadone concentration/dose values (P = .92; P = .86); the (S)-methadone concentration/dose values (P = .052; P = .95 [although there was a difference between the TT group and GT and GG groups P = .019]); or opiate cessation (P = .12; P = .90). CONCLUSION: The genotyping of CYP2B6 G516T could be an interesting tool to explore methadone intervariability.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) metabolism-related genes play an important role in the development of cancers. We assessed the associations of genetic variants in genes involved in the metabolism of PAHs and TSNA with risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in European populations using two published genome-wide association study datasets. In the single-locus analysis, we identified two SNPs (rs145533669 and rs35246205) in CYP2B6 to be associated with risk of SCCHN (P = 1.57 x 10(-4) and .004, respectively), two SNPs (EPHX1 rs117522494 and CYP2B6 rs145533669) to be associated with risk of oropharyngeal cancer (P = .001 and .004, respectively), and one SNP (rs4359199 in HSD17B12) to be associated with risk of oral cancer (P = .006). A significant interaction effect was found between rs4359199 and drinking status on risks of SCCHN and oropharyngeal cancer (P < .05). eQTL and sQTL analyzes revealed that two SNPs (CYP2B6 rs35246205 and HSD17B12 rs4359199) were correlated with alternative splicing or mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes in liver cells (P < .05 for both). In silico functional annotation suggested that these two SNPs may regulate mRNA expression by affecting the binding of transcription factors. Results from phenome-wide association studies presented significant associations between these genes and risks of other cancers, smoking behavior and alcohol dependence (P < .05). Thus, our study provided some insight into the underlying genetic mechanism of head and neck cancer, which warrants future functional validation.
Efavirenz is metabolized by CYP2B6, an inducible enzyme whose expression is regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor nuclear receptors. CAR and PXR are encoded by genetically polymorphic NR1I2 and NR1I3, respectively. We examined the impact of NR1I2 and NR1I3 genotype on plasma EFV concentration and CYP2B6 enzyme activity among TB-HIV co-infected patients in Ethiopia. Treatment-naive HIV patients with TB co-infection (n = 80) were enrolled and received first-line EFV-based antiretroviral and rifampicin-based anti-TB therapy. Plasma EFV and 8-hydroxy-EFV concentrations at the 4th and 16th week of EFV treatment were determined using LC/MS/MS. EFV/8-hydroxy-EFVmetabolic ratio was used as CYP2B6 metabolic activity index. In multivariate regression analysis, NR1I3 rs3003596C or NR1I2 rs2472677T variant allele carriers had significantly lower plasma EFV concentrations than non-carriers. Patients with NR1I2 rs3814057C/C genotype or NR1I3 rs3003596C allele carriers had significantly lower mean log EFV MR. Among CYP2B6*6 allele carriers, patients with NR1I3 rs2502815T/T or NR1I2 rs3814057C/C genotype had significantly lower mean log EFV MR. In conclusion, genetic variants in NR1I2 and NR1I3 genes influence plasma EFV exposure and CYP2B6 enzyme activity in TB-HIV co-infected patients on drug treatment.
AIMS: Methadone metabolism and clearance are determined principally by polymorphic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6). Some CYP2B6 allelic variants affect methadone metabolism in vitro and disposition in vivo. We assessed methadone metabolism by CYP2B6 minor variants in vitro. We also assessed the influence of CYP2B6 variants, and P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and CYP2C19 variants, on methadone clearance in surgical patients in vivo. METHODS: CYP2B6 and P450 oxidoreductase variants were coexpressed with cytochrome b(5) . The metabolism of methadone racemate and enantiomers was measured at therapeutic concentrations and intrinsic clearances were determined. Adolescents receiving methadone for surgery were genotyped for CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and POR, and methadone clearance and metabolite formation clearance were determined. RESULTS: In vitro, CYP2B6.4 was more active than wild-type CYP2B6.1. CYPs 2B6.5, 2B6.6, 2B6.7, 2B6.9, 2B6.17, 2B6.19 and 2B6.26 were less active. CYPs 2B6.16 and 2B6.18 were inactive. CYP2B6.1 expressed with POR variants POR.28, POR.5 and P228L had lower rates of methadone metabolism than wild-type reductase. In vivo, methadone clinical clearance decreased linearly with the number of CYP2B6 slow metabolizer alleles, but was not different in CYP2C19 slow or rapid metabolizer phenotypes, or in carriers of the POR*28 allele. CONCLUSIONS: Several CYP2B6 and POR variants were slow metabolizers of methadone in vitro. Polymorphisms in CYP2B6, but not CYP2C19 or P450 reductase, affected methadone clearance in vivo. CYP2B6 polymorphisms 516G>T and 983T>C code for canonical loss of function variants and should be assessed when considering genetic influences on clinical methadone disposition. These complementary translational in vitro and in vivo results inform on pharmacogenetic variability affecting methadone disposition in patients.
BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia (AL) is a kind of malignant tumor of hematopoietic system. A number of studies have suggested that Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are significantly associated with risk of AL. Present study performs meta-analysis to evaluate the association between CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant and AL risk. METHODS: Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang were searched for literatures to September 30, 2019, both in English and Chinese. Relative risk and its 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the associations. Statistical analyses of this meta-analysis were conducted by using STATA 13.0. software. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies, including 1038 cases and 1648 controls, were analyzed. Our results indicated that CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant was significantly related to an increased the risk of AL under dominant model, recessive model, homozygote model, and allelic model. In addition, subgroup analyses were also performed by disease classification, country, and study design. No significant associations were obtained between CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant and the risk of AL under the recessive model in the design of hospital-based (relative risk = 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.01; P  = 0.118). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that the CYP2B6 variant is significantly associated with AL risk, in which CYP2B6 c.516G>T is related to an increased risk of AL.
The CYP450 and UGT enzymes are involved in phase I and phase II metabolism of the majority of clinically prescribed drugs, including the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, efavirenz and nevirapine, used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Variations in the activity of these enzymes due to gene polymorphisms can affect an individual's drug response or may lead to adverse drug reactions. There is an inter-ethnic distribution in the frequency of these polymorphisms, with African populations exhibiting higher genetic diversity compared to other populations. African specific alleles with clinical relevance have also emerged. Given the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, understanding the frequency of pharmacogenetically relevant alleles in populations of African origin, and their impact on efavirenz and nevirapine metabolism, is becoming increasingly critical. This review aims to investigate ethnic variation of CYP2B6, CYP2A6 and UGT2B7, and to understand the pharmacogenetic relevance when comparing frequencies in African populations to other populations worldwide.
PURPOSE: Propofol is one of the most widely used fast-acting intravenously administered anesthetics. However, although large inter-individual differences in dose requirements and recovery time have been observed, there are few previous studies in which the association between several potential covariates, including genetic factors such as the UGT1A9 and CYP2B6 genotypes, and propofol pharmacokinetics was simultaneously examined. This study aimed to identify factors determining propofol pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Eighty-three patients were enrolled, and their blood samples were collected 1, 5, 10, and 15 min after administering a single intravenous bolus of propofol at a dose of 2.0 ml/kg to measure propofol plasma concentration. Area under the time-plasma concentration curve from zero up to the last measurable time point (AUC(15min)) was determined from the concentration data. The inter-individual variability of the propofol pharmacokinetics was evaluated by investigating relationships between AUC(15min) and genotype of UGT1A9 and CYP2B6; clinical factors, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and preoperative hematological examination; and hemodynamic variables measured by a pulse dye densitogram analyzer. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for the statistical analysis of continuous and categorical values, respectively. Subsequently, clinical factors that had p values of < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were examined in a multivariate analysis using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Age, BMI, indocyanine green disappearance ratio (K-ICG), hepatic blood flow (HBF), preoperative hemoglobin level, and sex were correlated with AUC(15min) (p < 0.05) in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis performed to adjust for age, BMI, K-ICG, HBF, preoperative hemoglobin level, and sex revealed only BMI as an independent factor associated with AUC(15min). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that BMI influences propofol pharmacokinetics after its administration as a single intravenous injection, while UGT1A9 and CYP2B6 SNPs, other clinical factors, and hemodynamic variables do not. These results suggest that BMI is an independent factor associated with propofol pharmacokinetics in several potential covariates.
