Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-5; After binding acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the genetic association between rs16969968 and lung cancer risk by meta-analysis. DATA SOURCE: We searched eligible studies from MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE up to Dec, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Association studies concerning rs16969968 and lung cancer risk were included. We assessed the association strength between this polymorphism and risk of lung cancer by calculating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: A total of 26 data sets comprising 30 772 lung cancers and 90 954 controls were included. rs16969968 was found to be associated with lung cancer risk in population of European ancestry in all models (A vs. G: OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.27-1.33, P < 0.001; AA + GA vs. GG: OR = 1.38, 95%CI 1.33-1.43, P < 0.001; AA vs. GG + GA: OR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.38-1.53, P < 0.001), consistent with previous genome-wide association study (GWAS). However, no association was observed in Asians (A vs. G: OR = 1.19. 95%CI 0.95-1.49, P = 0.131). The minor allele A may increase the risk of lung cancer in both smokers (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.29-1.39, P < 0.001) and nonsmokers (OR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.12-1.39, P < 0.001). There was no obvious publication bias in all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provided more evidence that rs16969968 is a susceptibility locus of lung cancer in the Caucasians and that it may be not associated with the risk in the Asians.
BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in the 15q25 region have been associated with the risk of lung cancer (LC). However, studies have yielded conflicting results. METHODS: Searches were conducted in databases, including PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang, for case-control studies up to August 1, 2019. After retrieving eligible studies and data extraction, we calculated pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. In the meta-analysis, we included 32 publications with a total of 52,795 patients with LC and 97,493 control cases to evaluate the polymorphisms in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster in the 15q25 region. RESULTS: Data of the meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk of LC in the presence of genetic polymorphisms (rs1051730, rs16969968, rs8034191). In the smoking subgroup, the CHRNA3 rs1051730 polymorphism was found to contribute to LC risk using following 5 models: the allelic model, the homozygous model, the heterozygous model, the dominant model, and the recessive model. Thus, the rs1051730 polymorphism may modify LC susceptibility under the condition of smoking. Stratification studies for CHRNA5-rs8034191 showed that Caucasian groups with the wild-type genotype (C/C) may be susceptible to LC in all 5 models. No significant relationship between CHRNA3 rs6495309 or rs3743073 and LC susceptibility was found. However, Asians with the rs3743037 B-allele showed an obviously higher risk of LC susceptibility than the Caucasian population, observed via allelic, heterozygous, and dominant models. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 polymorphisms of rs1051730, rs16969968 and rs8034191 in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster in the 15q25 region were associated with LC risk, which might be influenced by ethnicity and smoking status.
OBJECTIVE: The genetic polymorphism (rs16969968 in CHRNA5, and rs1051730 in CHRNA3 genes) were recently shown to be associated with risk of LC. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether they predispose Palestinian individuals to lung cancer, and how is this related to smoking. RESULTS: Frequency of the rs16969968-A allele was significantly higher in the case group (36.7%) than in normal controls (17.5%; P = 0.022; OR = 6.83 for AA and 2.81 for AG genotypes). The frequency of rs1051730-T allele was also significantly higher in the case group (46.7%) than in the control group (22.5%; P = 0.001; OR = 2.20 for TC and 13.22 for TT genotypes). Frequency of rs16969968-A allele was higher in smokers (29.1%) than nonsmokers (15.7%) regardless of lung cancer; similarly, frequency of rs1051730-T allele was also higher in smokers than in smokers (46.7% vs 22.5%, respectively). The higher the proportion of the risk allele (rs16969968-A and rs1051730-T), the higher the mean number of daily consumed cigarettes (P = 0.006). Carrying rs16969968-A and/or rs1051730-T alleles results in an increased risk to lung cancer probably by increasing the individual's tendency for heavy smoking. The allelic frequency of the rs16969968-A and rs1051730-T alleles among normal Palestinian controls is similar to different populations worldwide.
Smoking is a chronic and relapsing addictive trait that harms public health. Among the many identified genetic variants of nicotine dependence, the variants in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster on chromosome 15 that encode the alpha5, alpha3, and beta4 subunits have recently received a lot of attention. Importantly, variants in this gene cluster have been associated with nicotine addiction. Among the many significant variants in this cluster, the polymorphism SNP rs16969968 seems to be the most interesting factor in nicotine addiction. This polymorphism causes an amino acid change from aspartate to asparagine at position 398 of the alpha5 nicotinic receptor protein sequence. Our study aimed to analyze three polymorphic variants: the rs16969968 located in the CHRNA5 gene, the rs578776 and rs1051730 located in the CHRNA3 gene in nicotine-addicted subjects, and in controls. Our study encompasses an association analysis of genotypes and haplotypes. A group of 401 volunteers was recruited for the study and divided into two groups: the study group consisted of addicted smokers and a control group of 200 unrelated non-smokers who were not dependent on any substance and healthy. A statistically significant difference was observed in the frequency of genotypes of the rs1051730 polymorphism of the CHRNA3 gene (chi(2) = 6.704 p = 0.035). The T/T genotype was statistically significantly more frequent in the group of nicotine-dependent subjects. The haplotypes rs16969968, rs578776, and rs1051730 were distinguished, of which the G-T-T and G-C-T haplotypes were present only in the study group. With differences in frequencies, statistical significance was noted-for the G-T-T haplotype p = 0.01284 and the G-C-T haplotype p = 0.00775. The research stated that novel haplotypes G-T-T and G-C-T, though with very low-frequency variants in CHRNA3, were associated with nicotine addiction.
BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses show strong evidence of associations among genetic variants in CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25, smoking quantity, and lung cancer. This meta-analysis tests whether the CHRNA5 variant rs16969968 predicts age of smoking cessation and age of lung cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Meta-analyses examined associations between rs16969968, age of quitting smoking, and age of lung cancer diagnosis in 24 studies of European ancestry (n = 29 072). In each dataset, we used Cox regression models to evaluate the association between rs16969968 and the two primary phenotypes (age of smoking cessation among ever smokers and age of lung cancer diagnosis among lung cancer case patients) and the secondary phenotype of smoking duration. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed with the Cochran Q test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The rs16969968 allele (A) was associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91 to 0.98, P = .0042), and the AA genotype was associated with a four-year delay in median age of quitting compared with the GG genotype. Among smokers with lung cancer diagnoses, the rs16969968 genotype (AA) was associated with a four-year earlier median age of diagnosis compared with the low-risk genotype (GG) (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.12, P = 1.1*10(-5)). CONCLUSION: These data support the clinical significance of the CHRNA5 variant rs16969968. It predicts delayed smoking cessation and an earlier age of lung cancer diagnosis in this meta-analysis. Given the existing evidence that this CHRNA5 variant predicts favorable response to cessation pharmacotherapy, these findings underscore the potential clinical and public health importance of rs16969968 in CHRNA5 in relation to smoking cessation success and lung cancer risk.
INTRODUCTION: Smoking cessation is more than 50% heritable. Genetic studies of smoking cessation have been limited by short-term follow-up or cross-sectional design. AIMS AND METHODS: This study tests single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with cessation during long-term follow-up throughout adulthood in women. The secondary aim tests whether genetic associations differ by smoking intensity. Associations between 10 SNPs in CHRNA5, CHRNA3, CHRNB2, CHRNB4, DRD2, and COMT and the probability of smoking cessation over time were evaluated in two longitudinal cohort studies of female nurses, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) (n = 10 017) and NHS-2 (n = 2793). Participant follow-up ranged from 2 to 38 years with data collected every 2 years. RESULTS: Women with the minor allele of either CHRNA5 SNP rs16969968 or CHRNA3 SNP rs1051730 had lower odds of cessation throughout adulthood [OR = 0.93, p-value = .003]. Women had increased odds of cessation if they had the minor allele of CHRNA3 SNP rs578776 [OR = 1.17, p-value = .002]. The minor allele of DRD2 SNP rs1800497 was associated with lower odds of cessation in moderate-to-heavy smokers [OR = 0.92, p-value = .0183] but increased odds in light smokers [OR = 1.24, p-value = .096]. CONCLUSIONS: Some SNP associations with short-term smoking abstinence observed in prior studies were shown in the present study to persist throughout adulthood over decades of follow-up. Other SNP associations with short-term abstinence did not persist long-term. The secondary aim findings suggest genetic associations may differ by smoking intensity. IMPLICATIONS: The results of the present study expand on previous studies of SNP associations in relation to short-term smoking cessation to demonstrate some of these SNPs were associated with smoking cessation throughout decades of follow-up, whereas other SNP associations with short-term abstinence did not persist long-term. The rate of relapse to smoking remains high for several years after quitting smoking, and many smokers experience multiple quit attempts and relapse episodes throughout adulthood. Understanding genetic associations with long-term cessation has potential importance for precision medicine approaches to long-term cessation management.
INTRODUCTION: Variation in the CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster is a promising candidate region for smoking behavior and has been linked to multiple smoking-related phenotypes (e.g., nicotine dependence) and diseases (e.g., lung cancer). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs16969968 in CHRNA5 and rs1051730 in CHRNA3, have generated particular interest. METHODS: We evaluated the published evidence for association between rs16969968 (k = 27 samples) and rs1051730 (k = 44 samples) SNPs with heaviness of smoking using meta-analytic techniques. We explored which SNP provided a stronger genetic signal and investigated study-level characteristics (i.e., ancestry, disease state) to establish whether the strength of association differed across populations. We additionally tested for small study bias and explored the impact of year of publication. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis indicated compelling evidence of an association between the rs1051730/rs16966968 variants and daily cigarette consumption (fixed effects: B = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77, 1.06, p < .001; random effects: B = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.81, 1.22, p < .001), equivalent to a per-allele effect of approximately 1 cigarette/day. SNP rs1051730 was found to provide a stronger signal than rs16966968 in stratified analyses (p(diff) = .028), although this difference was only qualitatively observed in the subset of samples that provided data on both SNPs. While the functional relevance of rs1051730 is unknown, it may be a strong tagging SNP for functional haplotypes in this region.
BACKGROUND: Genetic studies have shown a possible relationship between the rs16969968 polymorphism in CHRNA5 and the risk of lung cancer. However, the results have been conflicting. Thus we rigorously conducted a meta-analysis to clarify any association. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 case-control studies involving 17,962 lung cancer cases and 77,216 control subjects were analysed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure the strength of the association. RESULTS: We found the CHRNA5 rs16969968 polymorphism to be associated with the risk of lung cancer (AA vs GG: OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.51-1.71). On stratified analysis by smoking status, a statistically significant increased risk was observed in the smoking group (AA vs GG: OR=1.80, 95%CI=1.61-2.01). However, this polymorphism was not associated with lung cancer risk in Asians (AA vs GG: OR=0.95, 95%CI=0.35-2.59), whereas it was linked to increased risk of lung cancer among Caucasians (AA vs GG: OR=1.65, 95%CI=1.55-1.76). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis provided statistical evidence for a strong association between rs16969968 polymorphism and the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers and Caucasians. Application of this relationship may contribute to identification of individuals at high risk of lung cancer and indicate a chemoprevention target.
AIM: To identify genetic variants associated with greater tobacco consumption in a Mexican population. PATIENTS & METHODS: Daily smokers were classified as light smokers (LS; n = 742), heavy smokers (HS; n = 601) and nonsmokers (NS; n = 606). In the first stage, a genotyping microarray that included 347 SNPs in CHRNA2-CHRNA7/CHRNA10, CHRNB2-CHRNB4 and NRXN1 genes and 37 ancestry-informative markers was used to analyze 707 samples (187 HS, 328 LS and 192 NS). In the second stage, 14 SNPs from stage 1 were validated in the remaining samples (HS, LS and NS; n = 414 in each group) using real-time PCR. To predict the role of the associated SNPs, an in silico analysis was performed. RESULTS: Two SNPs in NRXN1 and two in CHRNA5 were associated with cigarette consumption, while rs10865246/C (NRXN1) was associated with high nicotine addiction. The in silico analysis revealed that rs1882296/T had a high level of homology with Hsa-miR-6740-5p, which encodes a putative miRNA that targets glutamate receptor subunits (GRIA2, GRID2) and GABA receptor subunits (GABRG1, GABRA4, GABRB2), while rs1882296/C had a high level of homology with Hsa-miR-6866-5p, which encodes a different miRNA that targets GRID2 and GABRB2. CONCLUSION: In a Mexican Mestizo population, greater consumption of cigarettes was influenced by polymorphisms in the NRXN1 and CHRNA5 genes. We proposed new hypotheses regarding the putative roles of miRNAs that influence the GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways in smoking addiction.
PURPOSE: Cholinergic signals can be important modulators of cellular signaling in cancer. We recently have shown that knockdown of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5, CHRNA5, diminishes the proliferative potential of breast cancer cells. However, modulation of CHRNA5 expression in the context of estrogen signaling and its prognostic implications in breast cancer remained unexplored. METHODS: Meta-analyses of large breast cancer microarray cohorts were used to evaluate the association of CHRNA5 expression with estrogen (E2) treatment, estrogen receptor (ER) status and patient prognosis. The results were validated through RT-qPCR analyses of multiple E2 treated cell lines, CHRNA5 depleted MCF7 cells and across a breast cancer patient cDNA panel. We also calculated a predicted secondary (PS) score representing direct/indirect induction of gene expression by E2 based on a public dataset (GSE8597). Co-expression analysis was performed using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) pipeline. Multiple other publicly available datasets such as CCLE, COSMIC and TCGA were also analyzed. RESULTS: Herein we found that CHRNA5 expression was induced by E2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in breast cancer cell lines. ER(-) breast tumors exhibited higher CHRNA5 expression levels than ER(+) tumors. Independent meta-analysis for survival outcome revealed that higher CHRNA5 expression was associated with a worse prognosis in untreated breast cancer patients. Furthermore, CHRNA5 and its co-expressed gene network emerged as secondarily induced targets of E2 stimulation. These targets were largely downregulated by exposure to CHRNA5 siRNA in MCF7 cells while the response of primary ESR1 targets was dependent on the direction of the PS-score. Moreover, primary and secondary target genes were uncoupled and clustered distinctly based on multiple public datasets. CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly associate increased expression of CHRNA5 and its co-expression network with secondary E2 signaling and a worse prognosis in breast cancer.
