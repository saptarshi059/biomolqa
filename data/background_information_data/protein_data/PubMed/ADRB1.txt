Beta-1 adrenergic receptor; Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. This receptor binds epinephrine and norepinephrine with approximately equal affinity. Mediates Ras activation through G(s)-alpha- and cAMP-mediated signaling. Involved in the regulation of sleep/wake behaviors ; Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family. Adrenergic receptor subfamily. ADRB1 sub-subfamily.
Beta-blockers are widely used medications for a variety of indications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Genetic variability in pharmacokinetic (e.g., CYP2D6) and pharmacodynamic (e.g., ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, GRK5) genes have been studied in relation to beta-blocker exposure and response. We searched and summarized the strength of the evidence linking beta-blocker exposure and response with the six genes listed above. The level of evidence was high for associations between CYP2D6 genetic variation and both metoprolol exposure and heart rate response. Evidence indicates that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers experience clinically significant greater exposure and lower heart rate in response to metoprolol compared with those who are not poor metabolizers. Therefore, we provide therapeutic recommendations regarding genetically predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer status and metoprolol therapy. However, there was insufficient evidence to make therapeutic recommendations for CYP2D6 and other beta-blockers or for any beta-blocker and the other five genes evaluated (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).

Betablockers (BBs) are prescribed for ischaemia in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In Spain, bisoprolol and carvedilol are the most prescribed BBs, but patients often had to discontinue them due to adverse effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADRB1, ADRB2 and CYP2D6 genes have strong evidence of pharmacogenetic association with BBs in heart failure or hypertension, but the evidence in ACS is limited. Therefore, our study focuses on investigating how these genes influence the response to BBs in ACS patients. We analysed the association between SNPs in ADRB1 Gly389Arg (rs1801253) and Ser49Gly (rs1801252), ADRB2 Gly16Arg (rs1042713) and Glu27Gln (rs1042714), and CYP2D* 6 (*2- rs1080985, *4- rs3892097, *10 - rs1065852) and the occurrence of bradycardia/hypotension events during one year of follow-up. We performed an observational study and included 285 ACS-PCI-stent patients. A first analysis including patients treated with bisoprolol and a second analysis including patients treated with other BBs were performed. We found that the presence of the G allele (Glu) of the ADRB2 gene (rs1042714; Glu27Gln) conferred a protective effect against hypotension-induced by BBs; OR (CI 95%) = 0,14 (0,03-0,60), p < 0.01. The ADRB2 (rs1042713; Gly16Arg) GG genotype could also prevent hypotensive events; OR (CI 95%) = 0.49 (0.28-0.88), p = 0015. SNPs in ADRB1 and CYP2D6 * 2, CYP2D6 * 4 weren t associated with primary events. The effect of CYP2D6 * 10 does not seem to be relevant for the response to BBs. According to our findings, SNPs in ADRB2 (rs1042713, rs1042714) could potentially affect the response and tolerance to BBs in ACS-patients. Further studies are necessary to clarify the impact of ADRB2 polymorphisms.
Background and Objectives: Tachycardia is a common cardiovascular disease. Drugs blocking beta1-adrenergic receptors (ADRB1) are used in the therapy of arrhythmogenic heart diseases. Disease-related polymorphisms can be observed within the ADRB1 gene. The two most important are Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly, and they influence the treatment efficacy. The family of the cytochrome P450 system consists of the isoenzyme CYP2D6 (Debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase), which is involved in phase I metabolism of almost 25% of clinically important drugs, including antiarrhythmic drugs. A study was conducted to detect the ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms. Materials and Methods: The material for the test was whole blood from 30 patients with ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia and 20 controls. The samples were obtained from the Department of Pediatric Cardiology. The first to be made was the extraction of DNA using a GeneMATRIX Quick Blood DNA Purification Kit from EURx. The selected ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms were detected by high-resolution melting polymerase chain reaction (HRM-PCR) analysis. Results: Based on the analysis of melt profile data for each PCR product, the identification of polymorphisms was carried out. Heterozygotes and homozygotes were found in the examined alleles. Conclusions: The frequency of the Arg389Gly polymorphism differs statistically significantly between the control group and patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as between these two groups of patients. Moreover, the Arg389Gly polymorphism was statistically more prevalent in the group of girls with SVT arrhythmia compared to girls with VT. A few carriers of homozygous and heterozygous systems of the S49G polymorphism were detected among patients with arrhythmias, as well as control group. The percentage of individuals carrying the CYP2D6 4 allele as either homozygous or heterozygous was observed in the study and control groups. The high prevalence of the CYP2D6*4 allele carriers in both groups prompts the optimization of beta-1 blocker therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between beta1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene polymorphisms and beta-blocker treatment outcomes in patients with hypertension. METHODS: Chinese patients with essential hypertension were treated with the beta-blocker metoprolol and followed up for 12 weeks. xTAG(R) liquid-chip technology was used for CYP2D6 100 C > T and ADRB1 1165G > C genotyping. Associations between gene polymorphisms and antihypertensive therapy outcomes were assessed by generalized linear model fitting. A decrease of >/= 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure indicated an effective treatment outcome. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Mutant allele frequencies of 61.29% and 58.60% were obtained for ADRB1 and CYP2D6, respectively. There was no significant interaction between the effects of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on treatment outcome. Patients homozygous for the mutant ADRB1 genotype (CC) had better treatment outcomes than those heterozygous for the mutation (GC). Interestingly, beta-blocker treatment duration was an independent factor associated with treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The ADRB1 1165G > C gene polymorphism and beta-blocker treatment duration are independent factors associated with beta-blocker treatment outcome. These findings suggest that the selection of antihypertensive therapy should take into consideration the patient's genotype.
The beta1-adrenoceptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of myocardial contractility and heart rate. A functionally important polymorphism at codon 389 has been associated with heart failure and hypertension. The conventional method of detecting this polymorphism is a PCR-assay followed by digestion with specific restriction enzyme (PCR-RFLP) polymorphism. We aimed to establish an alternative, fast genotyping method by real time PCR, which combines high speed DNA-amplification and real time fluorescence monitoring using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Venous blood of 50 healthy volunteers was examined for the Arg389Gly polymorphism using both methods. The results from PCR-RFLP were compared to those obtained with real time fluorescence PCR and showed a 100% correlation. DNA sequencing confirmed a 100% concordance. This alternative technique is significantly less time consuming than traditional PCR-RFLP and facilitates the analysis of a large numbers of samples.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether variants in ADRB1 and CYP2C9 genes identify subgroups of individuals with differential response to treatment for Marfan syndrome through analysis of data from a large, randomized trial. STUDY DESIGN: In a subset of 250 white, non-Hispanic participants with Marfan syndrome in a prior randomized trial of atenolol vs losartan, the common variants rs1801252 and rs1801253 in ADRB1 and rs1799853 and rs1057910 in CYP2C9 were analyzed. The primary outcome was baseline-adjusted annual rate of change in the maximum aortic root diameter z-score over 3 years, assessed using mixed effects models. RESULTS: Among 122 atenolol-assigned participants, the 70 with rs1801253 CC genotype had greater rate of improvement in aortic root z-score compared with 52 participants with CG or GG genotypes (Time x Genotype interaction P = .005, mean annual z-score change +/- SE -0.20 +/- 0.03 vs -0.09 +/- 0.03). Among participants with the CC genotype in both treatment arms, those assigned to atenolol had greater rate of improvement compared with the 71 of the 121 assigned to losartan (interaction P = .002; -0.20 +/- 0.02 vs -0.07 +/- 0.02; P < .001). There were no differences in atenolol response by rs1801252 genotype or in losartan response by CYP2C9 metabolizer status. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, ADRB1-rs1801253 was associated with atenolol response in children and young adults with Marfan syndrome. If these findings are confirmed in future studies, ADRB1 genotyping has the potential to guide therapy by identifying those who are likely to have greater therapeutic response to atenolol than losartan.
BACKGROUND: Reliable, inexpensive, high-throughput genotyping methods are required for clinical trials. Traditional assays require numerous enzyme digestions or are too expensive for large sample volumes. Our objective was to develop an inexpensive, efficient, and reliable assay for CYP2D6 and ADRB1 accounting for numerous polymorphisms including gene duplications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized the multiplex SNaPshot(R) custom genotype method to genotype CYP2D6 and ADRB1. We compared the method to reference standards genotyped using the Taqman Copy Number Variant Assay followed by pyrosequencing quantification and determined assigned genotype concordance. RESULTS: We genotyped 119 subjects. Seven (5.9 %) were found to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), 18 (15.1 %) intermediate metabolizers (IMs), 89 (74.8 %) extensive metabolizers (EMs), and 5 (4.2 %) ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs). We genotyped two variants in the beta1-adrenoreceptor, rs1801253 (Gly389Arg) and rs1801252 (Ser49Gly). The Gly389Arg genotype is Gly/Gly 18 (15.1 %), Gly/Arg 58 (48.7 %), and Arg/Arg 43 (36.1 %). The Ser49Gly genotype is Ser/Ser 82 (68.9 %), Ser/Gly 32 (26.9), and Gly/Gly 5 (4.2 %). The multiplex SNaPshot method was concordant with genotypes in reference samples. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex SNaPshot method allows for specific and accurate detection of CYP2D6 genotypes and ADRB1 genotypes and haplotypes. This platform is simple and efficient and suited for high throughput.
Betaxolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. Personal response to the drug widely varies and depends on its properties and individual features including innate characteristics. Our aim was to study the association between the clinical response to betaxolol in patients with essential hypertension (EH) and polymorphous markers of two genes: beta(1) adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB1) and cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6). Eighty-one patients with EH were selected. Mean age was 52.2 +/- 1.22 years. Betaxolol monotherapy provided effective blood pressure control (BP < 140/90 mmHg) in 68 patients, 56 of them continued treatment with initial dose. The systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure declined significantly at the end of the study. We have not found any significant association of rest and exercise BP and heart rate (HR) with polymorphous marker Arg389Gly of ADRB1 gene except the nighttime variability of DBP. But in case of the polymorphous marker Pro34Ser of CYP2D6 gene we have found significant association with response to betaxolol therapy. The rest HR declined more significantly in Ser/Pro genotype carriers (-32.6 +/- 4.77 beats/min and -18.4 +/- 2.01 beats/min, P = 0.023). These patients demonstrated more significant increase of exercise time (4.58 +/- 0.90 and 0.59 +/- 0.58 min, P = 0.045). Maximal exercise HR and DBP were also significantly lower in Ser/Pro genotype carriers in comparison with Ser/Ser genotype carriers. Decline of mean daytime SBP in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was more significant in Pro allele carriers (-21.0 +/- 2.55 mmHg vs. -5.2 +/- 2.27 mmHg in patients with Ser/Ser genotype, P = 0.001). Betaxolol effect on HR and BP significantly depends on variability of the gene determining the drug metabolism. The carriers of Pro34 allele of CYP2D6 gene (8.6%) are more sensitive to betaxolol therapy. Because of the relatively small group sizes our data should be considered as preliminary ones. The increase of our groups and the replication in other studies will permit to estimate the contribution of genetic factors to betaxolol effect on HR and BP.
OBJECTIVES: Prolonged activation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) is associated with receptor desensitization. This process has been suggested to have important pathophysiological and clinical implications in conditions such as congestive heart failure. The contribution of genetic factors to this process is a subject of ongoing research. We have previously shown that the ADRB1 389 polymorphism affects the response to incremental dose infusion of the ADRB agonist dobutamine. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the ADRB1 389 polymorphism affects the hemodynamic response to constant dose infusion of dobutamine in healthy patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy patients were recruited according to their ADRB1 49 and 389 genotypes [15 Arg389Arg, 10 Gly389Arg, and 10 Gly389Gly patients (all Ser49Ser), 21 men and 14 women]. Following a standardized protocol of dose increase, 6 mcg/kg/min dobutamine was infused over 2 h. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and active plasma renin (PR) were measured. Standardized exercise (1 min) was performed at three time points during infusion. RESULTS: In all patients, resting systolic BP was significantly decreased during infusion [144.4+/-11.5 vs. 140.3+/-12.2 mmHg (mean+/-SD), P=0.007]. There was no change in HR, and PR following 120 min of dobutamine infusion. ADRB1 389 genotypes were not associated with HR, systolic BP, and PR changes during dobutamine infusion (all P>0.05, repeated measures analysis of variance). Sex was associated with response to dobutamine. Among women, but not in men, resting HR significantly increased, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) significantly decreased during dobutamine infusion [HR: 76.0+/-7.3 to 86.3+/-17.5 beats per minute (P=0.023), and DBP 78.5+/-8.49 mmHg to 72.36+/-6.16 (P=0.041) (repeated measures analysis of variance)]. CONCLUSION: In healthy patients, the ADRB1 389 genotype was not associated with hemodynamic changes during constant dobutamine infusion. In women, but not in men, HR significantly increased and DBP decreased during 2 h of infusion.
BACKGROUND: Genetic factors have a vital influence on the pathogenesis of hypertension. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the association of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms with antihypertensive effects and perform an analysis of their contribution to hypertension risk. METHODS: A total of 261 healthy individuals and 261 essential hypertension patients treated with metoprolol for 12 weeks were enrolled. ADRB1 and CYP2D6 genotypes were identified by xTAG liquid chip technology. We used multivariate logistic regression and a generalized linear mixed model to assess hypertension-related risk factors. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 variants were 59.8% and 64.6% in the essential hypertension group and 70.3% and 65.9% in the controls, respectively. The genotype and allele distribution of ADRB1 were significantly different between the 2 groups (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in CYP2D6 distribution (P = 0.91 and 0.88). By logistic regression analysis, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, high triglyceride and the Gly/Gly polymorphism in Arg389Gly ADRB1 all emerged as independent risk factors for hypertension. Additionally, the ADRB1 genotype played a major role in the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol and the patients with the Gly389Gly genotype showed a significantly better response to metoprolol than did those with a heterozygous ADRB1 mutation (Arg389Gly) (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that Gly/Gly polymorphism in Arg389Gly ADRB1 was an independent risk factor together with high fasting plasma glucose, smoking and high triglyceride; moreover, the patients who carried the Gly389Gly genotype had a significantly improved metoprolol antihypertensive effect than those with ADRB1.
BACKGROUND: G-protein receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) Gln41 > Leu and beta1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) Arg389 > Gly polymorphisms presented the different distribution of genotype frequencies between Caucasian American and African American, and produced the difference in beta-blocker treatment effect among them with systolic heart failure (SHF). OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify the distributed characteristics of these variant genotypes in Chinese population, and influence of GRK5 and ADRB1 polymorphisms on SHF morbidity and beta-blocker treatment effect in patients with SHF. METHODS: This study was based on cross-sectional survey data. 1794 and 1718 subjects' ADRB1 and GRK5 gene sequencing (sanger method) data were achieved respectively. Blood samples collection, clinical laboratory detection, electrocardiogram and echocardiography examinations were performed. Medication usage was confirmed at in-hospital visits or the questionnaire by personal interview. RESULTS: GRK5 Leu41Leu genotype was not found in our Chinese population. In non-SHF population, allele frequencies of GRK5 Gln41 and Leu41 were 2782 (0.992) and 22 (0.008) (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test chi(2) = 0.088, P = 0.767), and allele frequencies of ADRB1 Arg389 and Gly389 were 2127 (0.715) and 849 (0.285) (chi(2) = 0.272, P = 0.602). In SHF patients, allele frequencies of Gln41 and Leu41 were 446 (0.991) and 4 (0.009) (chi(2) = 0.018, P = 0.893), and allele frequencies of Arg389 and Gly389 were 331 (0.726) and 125 (0.274) (chi(2) = 1.892, P = 0.169). Further in logistic regression model, these ADRB1 and GRK5 variants were not significantly independently associated with the risk of SHF morbidity. Those carrying genotype ADRB1 Gly389Gly did not reduce significantly the risk of SHF morbidity after beta-blocker therapy. CONCLUSIONS: GRK5 Leu41Leu genotype was not found in our Chinese population, neither ADRB1 nor GRK5 variants presented independently associated with the risk of SHF morbidity, most ADRB1 and GRK5 polymorphisms did decrease significantly the risk of SHF morbidity after beta-blocker therapy except for those carrying genotype ADRB1 Gly389Gly.
BACKGROUND Our study aimed to explore the association between beta1-adrenoceptor (ADRB1) rs1801253 polymorphism and analgesic effect of fentanyl after cancer surgeries in Chinese Han populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Postoperative fentanyl consumption of 120 patients for analgesia was recorded. Genotype distributions were detected by allele specific amplification-polymerase chain reaction (ASA-PCR) method. Postoperative pain was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) method. Differences in postoperative VAS score and postoperative fentanyl consumption for analgesia in different genotype groups were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Preoperative cold pressor-induced pain test was also performed to test the analgesic effect of fentanyl. RESULTS Frequencies of Gly/Gly, Gly/Arg, Arg/Arg genotypes were 45.0%, 38.3%, and 16.7%, respectively, and passed the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) test. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the heart rate (HR) had no significant differences at different times. After surgery, the VAS score and fentanyl consumption in Arg/Arg group were significantly higher than in other groups at the postoperative 2nd hour, but the differences were not obvious at the 4th hour, 24th hour, and the 48th hour. The results suggest that the Arg/Arg homozygote increased susceptibility to postoperative pain. The preoperative cold pressor-induced pain test suggested that individuals with Arg/Arg genotype showed worse analgesic effect of fentanyl compared to other genotypes. CONCLUSIONS In Chinese Han populations, ADRB1 rs1801253 polymorphism might be associated with the analgesic effect of fentanyl after cancer surgery.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to establish the probability and patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF) inheritance in families, and to find an association of primary and secondary AF with polymorphism Ser49Gly of the gene encoding beta1-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1). METHODS: We examined 103 probands with AF and 301 relatives. Physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, Holter's monitoring of ECG, and other methods of functional diagnostics have been performed for all patients and their relatives. Genetic study has been performed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS: Our results show that probands with primary AF and their relatives have a prevalence of the heterozygous genotype (Ser49Gly) of ADRB1 gene compared with the control group: 15 (50.0%) probands and 11 (44.0%) relatives, respectively, and 38 (19.2%) in the control group (p < 0.05). Significant prevalence of heterozygous genotype (Ser49Gly) of ADRB1 gene was observed in patients of the second subgroup with secondary AF: 14 (46.7%) persons in comparison with 38 (19.2%) persons of the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Heterozygous genotype (Ser49Gly) of ADRB1 gene can be considered as one of the genetic predictors for development of primary or secondary AF. Relatives of probands with primary AF and genotype Ser49Gly should be included in the risk group for developing AF.
Background: This study investigated the influence of ADRB1 gene rs1801253 polymorphism on the treatment response of ticagrelor and aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: Genetic typing was detected by Sanger sequencing. Platelet inhibition was assessed using thromboelastography. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were applied for prognosis analysis. Results: Out of 200 participants, 94 cases with rs1801253-CC genotype and 106 cases with CG+GG genotype were found. There was no significant difference between the rs1801253-CC and CG+GG groups in the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina patients. There was no statistical difference in the basic data of patients in the two groups in terms of age, sex, medical history and medicine use in the dominant model. The rs1801253-CC genotype was a risk prognostic factor for ACS patients based on the Cox regression analysis results. Conclusion: Detecting ADRB1 polymorphism is crucial for ACS patients undergoing treatment with ticagrelor and aspirin.
beta1-adrenergic receptors (beta1-AR) directly affect on intracardiac hemodynamic and the ability of the heart to tolerate physical activity by regulating its inotropic and chronotropic functions. Severe hypersympathicotonia, specific to coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic heart failure (HF), leads to impaired functioning of beta1-AR. The aim of this research was to assess the expression level of the beta1-AR ADRB1 gene in the myocardium, to evaluate the beta-adrenergic reactivity of the membrane (beta-ARM) of erythrocytes, and to analyze the association of these parameters with myocardial contractile dysfunction in patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) in the past and without it. The study included 126 patients with chronic CAD. Among the patients, 55.6 % had a history of MI at least 6 months ago. The expression of the ADRB1 gene was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. With this purpose, we isolated RNA from the right atrial appendage, which was excised when a heart-lung machine was connected during a planned coronary bypass surgery. beta-ARM was evaluated in 57 patients. This method is based on the fact of inhibition of hemolysis of erythrocytes, placed in a hyposmotic medium, in the presence of a beta-blocker. Within the whole sample of patients, the expression of the ADRB1 gene is comparable in different functional classes of HF. There was no linear correlation between the expression of the ADRB1 gene and left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). In patients with a history of MI, the expression of the ADRB1 gene was elevated when compared to a group of patients without MI (p = 0.017). Patients with a history of MI had higher values of beta-ARM than those without MI (p = 0.017). The reverse correlation between beta-ARM and LVEF (r = -0,570, p = 0,002) was revealed in the group of patients without MI but not in the group of patients with a history of MI (r = -0,137, p = 0,479). In the sample of patients with chronic CAD, in the myocardium of subjects with a history of MI, the relative expression of ADRB1 gene was higher compared to the group of patients without MI. In patients with different functional classes (FC) of HF and with different ejection fraction, both with MI and without it, ADRB1 gene expression was comparable. In the group of patients with a history of MI, an increase in beta-ARM was observed, i.e. decrease in the number or sensitivity of beta-AR. Among patients without MI, an inverse correlation was found between beta-ARM and LVEF.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that (1) CYP2D6 genotype is associated with pharmacokinetics of ophthalmic timolol and (2) variation in genotypes of ADRB1 (beta(1)-adrenoceptor) and GNAS1 (alpha-subunit of G-protein) modulate heart rate (HR), and systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure responses to timolol. METHODS: Nineteen glaucoma patients and eighteen healthy volunteers were treated with 0.5% aqueous and 0.1% hydrogel formulations of ophthalmic timolol using a randomised cross-over design. The participants conducted head-up tilt and maximum exercise test at four visits. Plasma concentration of timolol was measured twice for glaucoma patients and ten times for healthy volunteers on each visit. Also, the genotypes for CYP2D6, ADRB1 and GNAS1 were determined. RESULTS: Among healthy volunteers using aqueous timolol, poor metabolisers (PMs, n=2) of CYP2D6 had higher maximum plasma concentrations (C(max), values 2.63 and 2.94 ng/ml), longer elimination half-lives ( T(1/2), 5.49 and 6.75 h), and higher area-under-curve (AUC, 19.54 and 23.25 ng.h/ml) than intermediate [IMs, n=6, mean+/-SD 1.73+/-0.59 ng/ml (not significant), 3.30+/-0.48 h, 11.32+/-3.72 ng.h/ml], extensive (EMs, n=8, 1.60+/-0.72 ng/ml, 3.24+/-1.24 h, 8.52+/-6.12 ng.h/ml) and ultra-rapid (UMs, n=2, values 1.23 and 1.67 ng/ml, 2.22 and 2.52 h, 6.16 and 6.94 ng.h/ml) metabolisers. The IMs, EMs and UMs did not differ from each other for any of the kinetic variables. Also, the elevation of HR from rest to maximum level tended to differ between PMs and IMs, and between PMs and UMs. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between the CYP2D6 groups did not differ with statistical significance when hydrogel timolol was used. Upon head-up tilt, the Ser49 homozygotes (n=26) had higher SAP (P=0.03) and DAP (P<0.01) than the Gly carriers (n=11). The change in DAP from rest to maximum during exercise was lower (P<0.01) in subjects with CC alleles of GNAS1 (n=13) than those with at least one T allele (n=24). CONCLUSION: The CYP2D6 poor metabolisers may be more prone to systemic adverse events with aqueous timolol than extensive metabolisers. Since CYP2D6 genotyping is not routine clinical practice, using 0.1% timolol hydrogel instead of 0.5% aqueous preparation will increase patient safety.
