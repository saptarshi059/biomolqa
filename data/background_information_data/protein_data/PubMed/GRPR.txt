Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor; Receptor for gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Signals via association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system, resulting in Akt phosphorylation. Contributes to the regulation of food intake. Contributes to the perception of prurient stimuli and transmission of itch signals in the spinal cord that promote scratching behavior, but does not play a role in the perception of pain. Contributes primarily to nonhistaminergic itch sensation. Contributes to long-term fear memory, but not normal spatial memory (By si [...] 
GRPR is a type of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor that belongs to the bombesin protein receptor family. It is highly expressed in various cancers, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and so on. As a result, molecular imaging studies have been conducted using radiolabeled GRPR ligands for tumor diagnosis, as well as monitoring of recurrence and metastasis. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive overview of relevant literature from the past two decades, with a specific focus on the advancements made in radiolabeled GRPR ligands for imaging prostate cancer and breast cancer.
Aim: This comprehensive review aims to explore the potential applications of Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Additionally, the study investigates the role of GRPR in prognostic assessment for individuals afflicted with prostate cancer.Methods: The review encompasses a thorough examination of existing literature and research studies related to the upregulation of GRPR in various tumor types, with a specific focus on prostate. The review also evaluates the utility of GRPR as a molecular target in prostate cancer research, comparing its significance to the well-established Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The integration of radionuclide-targeted therapy with GRPR antagonists is explored as an innovative therapeutic approach for individuals with prostate cancer.Results: Research findings suggest that GRPR serves as a promising molecular target for visualizing low-grade prostate cancer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated to complement the detection of lesions that may be negative for PSMA. The integration of radionuclide-targeted therapy with GRPR antagonists presents a novel therapeutic paradigm, offering potential benefits for individuals undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.Conclusions: In conclusion, this review highlights the emerging role of GRPR in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, the integration of radionuclide-targeted therapy with GRPR antagonists introduces an innovative therapeutic approach that holds promise for improving outcomes in individuals dealing with prostate cancer. The potential prognostic value of GRPR in assessing the disease's progression adds another dimension to its clinical significance in the realm of urology.
Addressing molecular targets, that are overexpressed by various tumor entities, using radiolabeled molecules for a combined diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic) approach is of increasing interest in oncology. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr), which is part of the bombesin family, has shown to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors, therefore, serving as a promising target for those theranostic applications. A large amount of differently radiolabeled bombesin derivatives addressing the GRPr have been evaluated in the preclinical as well as clinical setting showing fast blood clearance and urinary excretion with selective GRPr-binding. Most of the available studies on GRPr-targeted imaging and therapy have evaluated the theranostic approach in prostate and breast cancer applying bombesin derivatives tagged with the predominantly used theranostic pair of (68)Ga/(177)Lu which is the focus of this review.
The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), binds to ligands such as gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and plays a variety of biological roles. GRP/GRPR signalling is involved in the pathophysiological processes of many diseases, including inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, and various cancers. In the immune system, the unique function of GRP/GRPR in neutrophil chemotaxis suggests that GRPR can be directly stimulated through GRP-mediated neutrophils to activate selective signalling pathways, such as PI3K, PKC, and MAPK, and participate in the occurrence and development of inflammation-related diseases. In the cardiovascular system, GRP increases intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and induces vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). GRP activates ERK1/2, MAPK, and AKT, leading to cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction. Central nervous system signal transduction mediated by the GRP/GRPR axis plays a vital role in emotional responses, social interaction, and memory. The GRP/GRPR axis is elevated in various cancers, including lung, cervical, colorectal, renal cell, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. GRP is a mitogen in a variety of tumour cell lines. Its precursor, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), may play an important role as an emerging tumour marker in early tumour diagnosis. GPCRs serve as therapeutic targets for drug development, but their function in each disease remains unclear, and their involvement in disease progression has not been well explored or summarised. This review lays out the above mentioned pathophysiological processes based on previous research conclusions. The GRP/GRPR axis may be a potential target for treating multiple diseases, and the study of this signalling axis is particularly important.
Novel radiopharmaceuticals for PET are being evaluated for the diagnosis of biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PC). We compared the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-targeting (68)Ga-RM2 with the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting (68)Ga-PSMA11 and (18)F-DCFPyL. Methods: Fifty patients underwent both (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI and (68)Ga-PSMA11 (n = 23) or (18)F-DCFPyL (n = 27) PET/CT at an interval ranging from 1 to 60 d (mean +/- SD, 15.8 +/- 17.7 d). SUV(max) was collected for all lesions. Results:(68)Ga-RM2 PET was positive in 35 and negative in 15 of the 50 patients. (68)Ga-PSMA11/(18)F-DCFPyL PET was positive in 37 and negative in 13 of the 50 patients. Both scans detected 70 lesions in 32 patients. Forty-three lesions in 18 patients were identified on only 1 scan: (68)Ga-RM2 detected 7 more lesions in 4 patients, whereas (68)Ga-PSMA11/(18)F-DCFPyL detected 36 more lesions in 13 patients. Conclusion:(68)Ga-RM2 remains a valuable radiopharmaceutical even when compared with the more widely used (68)Ga-PSMA11/(18)F-DCFPyL in the evaluation of BCR of PC. Larger studies are needed to verify that identifying patients for whom these 2 classes of radiopharmaceuticals are complementary may ultimately allow for personalized medicine.
A11 dopaminergic neurons regulate somatosensory transduction by projecting from the diencephalon to the spinal cord, but the function of this descending projection in itch remained elusive. Here, we report that dopaminergic projection neurons from the A11 nucleus to the spinal dorsal horn (dopaminergic(A11-SDH) ) are activated by pruritogens. Inhibition of these neurons alleviates itch-induced scratching behaviors. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of spinal dopamine receptor D1-expressing (DRD1(+) ) neurons decreases acute or chronic itch-induced scratching. Mechanistically, spinal DRD1(+) neurons are excitatory and mostly co-localize with gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), an endogenous neuropeptide for itch. In addition, DRD1(+) neurons form synapses with GRP receptor-expressing (GRPR(+) ) neurons and activate these neurons via AMPA receptor (AMPAR). Finally, spontaneous itch and enhanced acute itch induced by activating spinal DRD1(+) neurons are relieved by antagonists against AMPAR and GRPR. Thus, the descending dopaminergic pathway facilitates spinal itch transmission via activating DRD1(+) neurons and releasing glutamate and GRP, which directly augments GRPR signaling. Interruption of this descending pathway may be used to treat chronic itch.
The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is a therapeutic target in colon cancer. Here we show that the GRPR antagonist RC-3095 (10(-3), 10(-6), or 1 microM) decreases nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. The results suggest that decreased secretion of neurotrophins might be a novel mechanism by which GRPR antagonists exert their antiproliferative effects in cancer cells.
