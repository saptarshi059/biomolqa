Calsenilin; Calcium-dependent transcriptional repressor that binds to the DRE element of genes including PDYN and FOS. Affinity for DNA is reduced upon binding to calcium and enhanced by binding to magnesium. Seems to be involved in nociception (By similarity).  May play a role in the regulation of PSEN2 proteolytic processing and apoptosis. Together with PSEN2 involved in modulation of amyloid-beta formation.
PURPOSE: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the common endocrine malignancy. Kv channel interacting protein 3 (KCNIP3) has been investigated in a variety of diseases, but its role and underlying mechanism in PTC are not fully delineated. Based on this, this study mainly explored the possible mechanism of KCNIP3 in PTC. METHODS: KCNIP3 expression in PTC tissues was analyzed by ENCORI and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). KCNIP3 overexpression (oe-KCNIP3) or KCNIP3 silence (si-KCNIP3) was transfected into IHH4 and FTC-133 cells, respectively. Then cell biological behaviors were detected by cell function assays. The expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related proteins were quantified by qRT-PCR and western blot. Lastly, IHH4 cells were treated with LiCl and the above assays were performed again. RESULTS: The expression of KCNIP3 was decreased in PTC. After transfection, oe-KCNIP3 inhibited the PTC cell viability, cloning, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis, and meanwhile, oe-KCNIP3 reduced the EMT and Wnt pathway activation. In contrast, si-KCNIP3 had the opposite effect. Moreover, LiCl, a Wnt signaling pathway activator, could reverse the above effects of oe-KCNIP3. CONCLUSION: KCNIP3 might play an anticarcinogenic role in PTC via inhibiting the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
