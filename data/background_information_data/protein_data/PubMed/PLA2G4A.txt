Cytosolic phospholipase A2; Selectively hydrolyzes arachidonyl phospholipids in the sn-2 position releasing arachidonic acid. Together with its lysophospholipid activity, it is implicated in the initiation of the inflammatory response.
BACKGROUND: Bioactive lipids involved in the progression of various diseases. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of biomarkers and relative regulatory targets. The lipidomic analysis of the samples from platinum-resistant in gastric cancer patients is expected to help us further improve our understanding of it. METHODS: We employed LC-MS based untargeted lipidomic analysis to search for potential candidate biomarkers for platinum resistance in GC patients. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis were used to identify differential lipids. The possible molecular mechanisms and targets were obtained by metabolite set enrichment analysis and potential gene network screened. Finally, verified them by immunohistochemical of a tissue microarray. RESULTS: There were 71 differential lipid metabolites identified in GC samples between the chemotherapy-sensitivity group and the chemotherapy resistance group. According to Foldchange (FC) value, VIP value, P values (FC > 2, VIP > 1.5, p < 0.05), a total of 15 potential biomarkers were obtained, including MGDG(43:11)-H, Cer(d18:1/24:0) + HCOO, PI(18:0/18:1)-H, PE(16:1/18:1)-H, PE(36:2) + H, PE(34:2p)-H, Cer(d18:1 + hO/24:0) + HCOO, Cer(d18:1/23:0) + HCOO, PC(34:2e) + H, SM(d34:0) + H, LPC(18:2) + HCOO, PI(18:1/22:5)-H, PG(18:1/18:1)-H, Cer(d18:1/24:0) + H and PC(35:2) + H. Furthermore, we obtained five potential key targets (PLA2G4A, PLA2G3, DGKA, ACHE, and CHKA), and a metabolite-reaction-enzyme-gene interaction network was built to reveal the biological process of how they could disorder the endogenous lipid profile of platinum resistance in GC patients through the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. Finally, we further identified PLA2G4A and ACHE as core targets of the process by correlation analysis and tissue microarray immunohistochemical verification. CONCLUSION: PLA2G4A and ACHE regulated endogenous lipid profile in the platinum resistance in GC patients through the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. The screening of lipid biomarkers will facilitate earlier precision medicine interventions for chemotherapy-resistant gastric cancer. The development of therapies targeting PLA2G4A and ACHE could enhance platinum chemotherapy effectiveness.
Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the PTGS2/PLA2G4A locus were detected among 118 British family trios of schizophrenia patients. The transmission disequilibrium test showed that SNP4 located in the 5'-flanking region of the PLA2G4A gene was associated with schizophrenia and that the haplotype analysis also showed a genetic association between the PTGS2 gene and schizophrenia. Because these two genes are arranged in a head-to-head configuration and separated by just about 149kb of DNA, they may have a combined effect on susceptibility to schizophrenia in some cases.
Osteoarthritis (OA), which is characterized by articular cartilage degeneration, shows a gradually increasing incidence with age. This study explored the molecular mechanism underlying the proliferation and apoptosis of chondrocytes during OA progression. In this study, chondrocytes were isolated from human knee cartilages. The targeted relationship among nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), microRNA-543 (miR-543) and PLA2G4A was predicted on TargetScan V7.2 and starBase and validated by performing dual-luciferase reporter assay. High-expressed NEAT1 was detected in OA cartilage and chondrocytes. NEAT1 was negatively correlated with miR-543 and was low-expressed in OA cartilage and PLA2G4A was negatively correlated with miR-543 and was high-expressed in OA cartilage. In OA chondrocytes, the overexpressed NEAT1 inhibited the expressions of p-Akt1 and Bcl-2 and upregulated that of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, but such effects of overexpressed NEAT1 were reversed by miR-543 mimic. SiRNA-NEAT1 exerted an opposite effect to NEAT1 overexpression on OA chondrocytes, but this could be reversed by miR-543 inhibitor. The effect of PLA2G4A overexpression was the opposite to miR-543 mimic on OA chondrocytes. In conclusion, NEAT1 could sponge miR-543 to induce PLA2G4A expression, inhibit chondrocyte proliferation and promote apoptosis.
PURPOSE: The primary aim was to respectively evaluate PLA2G4A mutants modifying protective effect of tea consumption against colorectal cancer (CRC), colon and rectal cancer. METHODS: All participants were recruited from January 2006 to April 2008. The information about tea consumption was collected by a structured questionnaire. CRC patients were diagnosed based on histology. Four single-nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLA2G4A gene were selected. Multiple logistic regression models were used for assessing the joint effects between tea consumption and SNPs on CRC, colon and rectal cancer. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with CRC and 296 controls well-matched were used in the final analyses. The significant individual associations between four SNPs (rs6666834, rs10911933, rs4650708 and rs7526089) and CRC were not observed. However, their CTAC haplotype was significantly associated with the increased risk of CRC (OR = 3.06; 95%CI = 1.52-6.19), compared with TCAC haplotype. Drinking tea was correlated with a decreased risk of CRC after adjustment for covariates (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.97). Meanwhile, compared with no-tea drinkers with TT/CT genotype of rs6666834, tea drinkers with TT/CT or CC had significant lower risk of CRC (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.36-1.00 for TT/CT; 0.38, 0.19-0.74 for CC). The joint effects between the remaining three SNPs and drinking tea on CRC were observed as well. Similar findings were observed on colon and rectal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Tea consumption and haplotype of mutants in PLA2G4A gene were respectively associated with the risk of CRC. PLA2G4A mutants modified the protective effect of tea consumption against CRC, colon and rectal cancers in Chinese population.
HOXA9 and MEIS1 are frequently upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including those with MLL-rearrangement. Because of their pivotal role in hemostasis, HOXA9 and MEIS1 appear non-druggable. We, thus, interrogated gene expression data of pre-leukemic (overexpressing Hoxa9) and leukemogenic (overexpressing Hoxa9 and Meis1; H9M) murine cell lines to identify cancer vulnerabilities. Through gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analyses, we compiled a list of 15 candidates for functional validation. Using a novel lentiviral multiplexing approach, we selected and tested highly active sgRNAs to knockout candidate genes by CRISPR/Cas9, and subsequently identified a H9M cell growth dependency on the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A). Similar results were obtained by shRNA-mediated suppression of Pla2g4a. Remarkably, pharmacologic inhibition of PLA2G4A with arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) accelerated the loss of H9M cells in bulk cultures. Additionally, AACOCF3 treatment of H9M cells reduced colony numbers and colony sizes in methylcellulose. Moreover, AACOCF3 was highly active in human AML with MLL rearrangement, in which PLA2G4A was significantly higher expressed than in AML patients without MLL rearrangement, and is sufficient as an independent prognostic marker. Our work, thus, identifies PLA2G4A as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for H9M-dependent AML with MLL-rearrangement.
Abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism may be associated with altered cytosolic Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) signaling in patients with schizophrenia. The relationship between schizophrenia and the functional BanI polymorphism (rs10798059 variant, A/G polymorphism) of the PLA2G4A gene for cPLA2 has been extensively investigated. We previously reported that it can influence several clinical features of schizophrenia, and it was shown to contribute to schizophrenia risk in several population studies. We performed PCR/RFLP genotyping of 263 Croatian patients (males/females: 139/124) to investigate the relationship between the BanI polymorphism and fasting plasma glucose and lipid levels in patients with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that the BanI polymorphic variant contributes significantly to plasma glucose levels in female patients. Females carrying the PLA2G4A-G allele (PLA2G4A-GG homozygous and PLA2G4A-AG heterozygous) presented with lower glucose levels than PLA2G4A-AA homozygous carriers, and the PLA2G4A genotype contributed approximately 6% of plasma glucose level variability in this group of patients.
BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), consisting of intrahepatic (IHCCA), perihilar (PHCCA), and distal (DCCA) CCA, is a type of highly aggressive malignancy with a very dismal prognosis. Potential biomarkers and drug targets of CCA are urgently needed. As a new member of the Annexin (ANXA) family, the role of ANXA10 in the progression and prognosis of CCA is unknown. METHODS: Potential PHCCA biomarkers were screened by transcriptome sequencing of 5 pairs of PHCCA and adjacent tissues. The clinical significance of ANXA10 was evaluated by analyzing its correlation with clinicopathological variables, and the prognostic value of ANXA10 was evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. The function of ANXA10 in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation, invasion and metastasis was detected with in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, we screened the key molecule in ANXA10-induced CCA progression by mRNA sequencing and evaluated the correlation between PLA2G4A and ANXA10. The effect of PLA2G4A downstream signaling, including Cyclooxygenase 2, Prostaglandin E2(PGE2) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3), on EMT and metastasis was further detected with in vitro and in vivo experiments. FINDINGS: ANXA10 expression was upregulated in PHCCA and DCCA but not in IHCCA. High ANXA10 expression was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation and prognosis. ANXA10 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of the PHCCA cells. PLA2G4A expression was regulated by ANXA10 and high PLA2G4A predicted poor prognosis in PHCCA and DCCA. ANXA10 facilitated EMT and promoted metastasis by upregulating PLA2G4A expression, thus increasing PGE2 levels and activating STAT3. INTERPRETATION: ANXA10 was an independent prognostic biomarker of PHCCA and DCCA but not IHCCA. ANXA10 promoted the progression of PHCCA and facilitated metastasis by promoting the EMT process via the PLA2G4A/PGE2/STAT3 pathway. ANXA10, PLA2G4A and their downstream molecules, such as COX2 and PGE2, may be promising drug targets of PHCCA and DCCA.
BACKGROUND: Despite the clinical success of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, prostate cancer (PCa) inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Transcription factor 6 alpha (ATF6alpha), an effector of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that modulates the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, has been linked to tumor development, metastasis, and relapse. However, the role of ATF6alpha in CRPC remains unclear. METHODS: The effect of ATF6alpha on the CRPC-like phenotype in PCa cells was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carb-Oxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS), 5-Bromo-2-deoxyUridine (BrdU) incorporation analysis, and cell death assay. Mechanistically, bioinformatic analysis was utilized to evaluate the potential of PLA2G4A as the target of ATF6alpha. Moreover, Western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, arachidonic acid (AA), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assays were performed to identify the regulatory effect of ATF6alpha on PLA2G4A. RESULTS: In this study, we found that the increase of ATF6alpha expression in response to androgen deprivation generates PCa cells with a CRPC-like phenotype. PCa cells with high levels of ATF6alpha expression are resistant to ferroptosis, and genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ATF6alpha could, therefore, promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and delay PCa progression. Molecular analyses linked ATF6alpha regulation of ferroptosis to the PLA2G4A-mediated release of AA and the resulting increase in PGE2 production, the latter of which acts as an antiferroptotic factor. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines ATF6alpha as a novel antiferroptotic regulator that exacerbates PCa progression. In addition, our data establish ATF6alpha-PLA2G4A signaling as an important pathological pathway in PCa, and targeting this pathway may be a novel treatment strategy.
BACKGROUND: Leukotrienes are proinflammatory molecules derived from dietary PUFAs and have been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We previously reported that an A-->G variant (rs12746200) of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 group IVA gene (PLA2G4A), which encodes the enzyme that liberates PUFAs from cellular membranes for leukotriene synthesis, decreases the risk of CVD. OBJECTIVE: We sought to replicate these initial observations with a more clinically relevant phenotype, such as myocardial infarction (MI), and to determine whether dietary PUFAs mediate this association. DESIGN: In a Costa Rican case-control data set (n = 3971), rs12746200 was genotyped and was tested for an association with MI. Functional experiments were carried out to determine whether rs12746200 led to differences in mRNA expression. RESULTS: Risk of MI was significantly lower in AG/GG subjects than in AA homozygotes (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.99; P = 0.040). The reduced risk of MI was observed primarily in AG/GG subjects who were above the median for intake of dietary omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P-interaction = 0.005). A similar analysis with dietary omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs did not show a statistically significant nutrigenetic association (P-interaction = 0.23). Functional analysis in human aortic endothelial cells showed that the carriers of the G allele had significantly lower PLA2G4A gene expression (P = 0.014), consistent with the atheroprotective association of this variant. CONCLUSION: These results replicate the association of rs12746200 with CVD phenotypes and provide evidence that the protective association of this functional PLA2G4A variant is mediated by dietary PUFAs.
In this study, we aimed at exploring and validating the prognostic value of PLA2G4A expression in patients with non-M3/nucleophosmin (NPM1) wildtype (WT) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by using two independent datasets. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-acute myeloid leukemia (TCGA-LAML) and the therapeutically applicable research to generate effective treatments (TARGET)-AML were used to assess the prognostic value of PLA2G4A in NPM1-WT AML cases. Results showed that non-M3 AML cases had significantly increased PLA2G4A expression compared with normal peripheral blood samples. Patients with high PLA2G4A expression (separated by median gene expression) had a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared with the group with low PLA2G4A expression, in both TCGA-LAML and TARGET-AML. Multivariate analysis showed that high PLA2G4A expression was independently associated with shorter OS in 97 non-M3/NPM1-WT AML cases in TCGA-LAML (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.946, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.094-3.462, q = 0.036). The prognostic value was validated based on 120 primary non-M3/NPM1-WT AML cases in TARGET-AML (HR: 1.518, 95% CI: 1.037-2.223, q = 0.048). Therefore, PLA2G4A expression might serve as an independent prognostic marker in OS in patients with non-M3/NPM1 WT AML. Bioinformatic analysis identified that several proteins physically interacted with PLA2G4A, some of which have well-characterized oncogenic properties in AML, such as RUVBL2, cytoskeleton regulatory protein 1 (CAP1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and MYCBP. Therefore, we hypothesized that PLA2G4A upregulation has multiple effects on the malignant phenotype of AML cells together with its partners. Future molecular studies are required to explore the detailed regulatory network involved.
Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) and related elements account for more than 8% of the human genome and significantly contribute to the human transcriptome by long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity. In this context, HERVs are thought to intervene in the expression of adjacent genes by providing regulatory sequences (cis-effect) or via noncoding RNA including natural antisense transcripts. To address the potential impact of HERV activity in urothelial carcinoma, we comparatively analyzed the HERV transcription profiles in paired samples of non-malignant urothelium and urothelial carcinoma derived from 13 patients with bladder cancer by means of a retrovirus-specific microarray (RetroArray). We established a characteristic HERV signature consisting of six ubiquitously active HERV subgroups (E4-1, HERV-Rb, ERV9, HERV-K-T47D, NMWV3, HERV-KC4). The transcription pattern is largely identical in human urothelial carcinoma, non-malignant urothelial tissue, four tumor-derived cell lines and in a non-malignant urothelial cell line (UROtsa). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of HERV-E4-1, HERV-K(HML-6) and HERV-T(S71-TK1) revealed a bias to lower HERV activity in carcinoma samples compared to non-malignant tissue. Determination of active HERV-E4-1 loci by cloning and sequencing revealed six HERV-E4-1 proviral loci that are differentially regulated in urothelial carcinoma cells and normal tissue. Two full-length HERV-E4-1 proviruses, HERV-Ec1 and HERV-Ec6, are located in antisense orientation in introns of the genes PLA2G4A and RNGTT, respectively. PLA2G4A encodes a cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) that is dysregulated in many human tumors. PLA2G4A and HERV-Ec1 displayed reciprocal transcript levels in 7 of 11 urothelial carcinoma patients. Moreover, reciprocal shifts were observed after treatment of UROtsa cells with HERV-Ec1 and PLA2G4A-directed siRNAs or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) pointing to an antagonistic regulation of PLA2G4A and HERV-Ec1 transcription in human urothelial cells. We suggest that transcription of HERV-Ec1 contributes to fine tuning of cPLA2 expression, thereby facilitating tumorigenesis.
NSAIDs-induced urticaria and/or angioedema (NIUA) is the most frequent entity of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs. The underlying cause is considered to be because of a nonspecific immunological mechanism in which mast cells are key players. We studied the association of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in five genes involved in mast cell activation (SYK, LAT1, PLCG1, PLA2G4A, and TNFRSF11A) in 450 NIUA patients and 500 controls. We identified several statistically significant associations when stratifying patients by symptoms: PLA2G4A rs12746200 (urticaria vs. controls, Pc=0.005). PLCG1 rs2228246 (angioedema vs. controls; Pc=0.044), and TNFRS11A rs1805034 (urticaria+angioedema vs. controls; Pc=0.041). The frequency of haplotype PLCG1 rs753381-rs2228246 (C-G) in angioedema-NIUA patients was lower than that in controls (Pc=0.040). In addition, the haplotype frequency of TNFRS11A rs1805034-rs35211496 (C-T) was higher among urticaria-NIUA and urticaria+angioedema-NIUA patients than the controls (Pc=0.045 and 0.046). Our results shed light on the involvement of variants in genes related to non-immunological mast cell activation in NIUA.
We investigated the etiology of the attenuated niacin skin flush response in schizophrenia patients. Skin response to topical niacin of 0.1M, 0.01 M, 0.001 M, and 0.0001 M concentrations was rated using method of volumetric niacin response (VNR) and correlated to two functional A/G polymorphisms in genes: phospholipase A2 group IVA (BanI of the PLA2G4A), and rs689466 of the prostaglandin synthase-2 (PTGS2). We further tested the possible correlation between niacin response and fatty acid (FA) content of red blood cells (RBCs). We detected statistically significant but weak impact of both polymorphisms on niacin flush response in schizophrenia patients. The dosage of the G alleles of both polymorphisms was associated with higher VNR values, although each polymorphic variant accounted for only 1% of the overall flush response variability. Regarding FA content, both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) were significantly reduced in the patient group, but an association with niacin sensitivity was not detected.
