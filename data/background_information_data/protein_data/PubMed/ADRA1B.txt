Alpha-1B adrenergic receptor; This alpha-adrenergic receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol- calcium second messenger system. Its effect is mediated by G(q) and G(11) proteins. Nuclear ADRA1A-ADRA1B heterooligomers regulate phenylephrine (PE)-stimulated ERK signaling in cardiac myocytes. Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family. Adrenergic receptor subfamily. ADRA1B sub-subfamily.
AIM: A genomic region on 5q33.3 lies between and encompasses the IL12B and PTTG1 genes, and contains many potential psoriasis causal variants. We aimed to further examine the influence of variants in and around this region. MATERIALS & METHODS: We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based regression analysis to assess independent contributions of 2171 variants to psoriasis susceptibility and tested them for association with different clinical psoriasis subtypes. RESULTS: We found that ADRA1B gene variants contribute to psoriasis in Chinese population. ADRA1B gene variants have a stronger association with moderate-to-severe disease group and an earlier age at onset of psoriasis than IL-12B and PTTG1 variants. CONCLUSION: The association of variants in the ADRA1B gene with psoriasis could explain why variants in the IL-12B, ADRA1B and PTTG1 gene regions are associated with psoriasis.
Pharmacological evidence suggests the importance of noradrenergic and other monoaminergic neurotransmitters in the aetiology and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Until recently, the genes of the noradrenergic pathway were not intensively investigated in ADHD compared to dopaminergic and serotonergic candidates. In this study, 91 SNP markers of 14 noradrenergic genes (an average density of one SNP per 4.5 kbp) were examined in ADHD samples from Ireland and Australia. Although suggestive evidence of association (nominal p </= 0.05) with the genes SLC6A2, ADRA1A, ADRA1B and ADRA2B was observed, none remained significant after permutation adjustments. In contrast, haplotype analyses demonstrated a significant association between ADHD and a SLC6A2 haplotype comprising the markers rs36009, rs1800887, rs8049681, rs2242447 and rs9930182 (chi(2) = 9.39, p-corrected = 0.019, OR = 1.51). A rare ADRA1B haplotype made of six SNPs (rs2030373, rs6884105, rs756275, rs6892282, rs6888306 and rs13162302) was also associated (chi(2) = 7.79, p-corrected = 0.042 OR = 2.74) with the disorder. These findings provide evidence of a contribution of the noradrenaline system to the genetic aetiology of ADHD. The observed haplotype association signals may be driven by as yet unidentified functional risk variants in or around the associated regions. Functional genomic analysis is warranted to determine the biological mechanism of the observed association.
