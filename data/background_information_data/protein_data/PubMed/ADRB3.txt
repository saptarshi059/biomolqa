Beta-3 adrenergic receptor; Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. Beta- 3 is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis.
BACKGROUND: The beta(3) -adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) is very important in the regulation of the human detrusor muscle function. The well-known tryptophan64arginine polymorphism of the ADRB3 gene alters the response of the receptor to various stimuli, including adrenalin and noradrenalin, and may increase the susceptibility to develop overactive bladder (OAB). Therefore, this study was performed to determine whether ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism is associated with the pathophysiology of OAB syndrome. METHODS: The study group (n = 150) consists of 72 patients with OAB and 78 controls without OAB. Venous blood samples were taken from all participants to analyze the ADRB3 gene Trp64Arg polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. We compared the distribution of Trp64Arg polymorphism and symptom severity in both OAB and non-OAB subjects using chi(2) test and Mann-Whitney's U test, respectively. RESULTS: The frequency of the 64Arg variant (heterozygous plus homozygous) in OAB and non-OAB subjects was 15.3% and 14.1%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the OAB and non-OAB groups in regard to the distribution frequency of ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism. The total frequency (OAB + non-OAB, 76 women and 74 men) of the Arg64 variant allele was 5.9% and 10.8% in women and in men, respectively. Although the frequency of the Arg64 variant was nearly twofold higher in men compared to women, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that the ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism is not significantly associated with OAB syndrome in a sample of Turkish OAB patients.
OBJECTIVES: Activation of beta3-adrenoceptor (ADRB3) is essential in the process of human adipose tissue browning, but obese subjects suffered from reduced ability of brown adipose tissue activation. The present study aims to detect the adipocyte ADRB3 expression in overweight individuals and the relationship between adipocyte ADRB3 expression and adiposity in adults. METHODS: Visceral adipose tissue samples were obtained from 85 subjects who underwent abdominal surgery. ADRB3 mRNA and protein expression levels in mature adipocytes and adipose tissue stromal vascular cells were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. UCP-1mRNA expression levels in mature adipocytes were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The data revealed that ADRB3 mRNA (p = 0.021) and protein (p = 0.025) expression levels in mature adipocytes were significantly higher in the normal-weight than in the overweight group. Similar results were also found for ADRB3 mRNA (p = 0.041) and protein (p = 0.025) expressions of stromal vascular cells. An inverse correlation was verified between mature adipocyte ADRB3 mRNA expression and BMI (r = -0.362, p = 0.012). UCP-1 mRNA expression levels in mature adipocytes were higher in the normal-weight group compared with the overweight group (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Adipocyte ADRB3 expression levels were down-regulated before the onset of obesity, which indicated that the reduction of ADRB3 expression might be the cause of compromised adipose tissue browning and obesity rather than the result. Thus, the interference of the ADRB3 pathway in adipocytes may provide a potential treatment target for obesity.
BACKGROUND: Recently, some studies claim that adipokines may modulate plasma lipids. More interestingly, the ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism may regulate adipokines and play an essential role in lipids metabolism. This study aims to clarify the associations of ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism with plasma adipokines and lipid levels. METHODS: Twenty-two studies (5527 subjects) and 121 studies (54,059 subjects) were respectively identified for the association analyses of adipokines and lipids. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate the strength of the Trp64Arg variant in adipokines and plasma lipids. All results were recalculated after eliminating the studies with heterogeneity. RESULTS: The carriers of the C allele (Arg at 64th position was encoded by the C allele) had higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin than the non-carriers. The carriers of the C allele had higher levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than the non-carriers. Subgroup analysis certified an ethnicity (Asians), disease status (obesity), and gender (females) specific association. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the analysis results were robust and stable. Meta-regression indicated that obesity was related to adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: The C allele carriers of Trp64Arg polymorphism had a slight but significant influence on lipid levels, and the remarkable effects specific existed in obese Asian women. The associations of Trp64Arg polymorphism with dyslipidemia may partly be mediated by the effect of this polymorphism on adipokines. The association of Trp64Arg polymorphism with obesity may partly be mediated by the effect of this polymorphism on adipokines. The C allele carriers had abnormal levels of adipokines and lipids, and it indicated that the Trp64Arg polymorphism might represent a genetic risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD).
Whether the Adrenoceptor Beta 3 (ADRB3) gene rs4994 polymorphism could affect the individual risk of childhood and adolescent overweight/obesity remains controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of this polymorphism in overweight/obesity, and test the potential association by summarizing existing evidence. Comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and CNKI databases was performed to identify eligible data sets. Finally, 16 studies involving 5,147 overweight/obese cases and 7,350 non-obese controls were included for further synthetic analyses. Odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were statistically calculated. Totally, 69.9% of the included subjects came from East Asia. In the meta-analysis for overall population, statistically significant associations with increased risk of childhood and adolescent overweight/obesity were identified in allele model (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.38), heterozygote model (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.16-1.68), and dominant model (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.54). Further stratified analysis according to geographical regions revealed that the statistical significance could only be detected in the East Asia subgroup in allele model, homozygote model, heterozygote model, and dominant model. In summary, our meta-analysis indicated that the ADRB3 rs4994 polymorphism could significantly increase the risk of childhood and adolescent overweight/obesity, especially for the East Asia's population.
The management of premature birth still remains unsatisfactory. Since the relative lack of efficiency and/or safety of current tocolytic agents have been highlighted, it is necessary to develop new uterorelaxant drugs deprived of important maternal and foetal side effects. Our work reported in this review focuses on a potential new target for tocolytic drugs, the beta3-adrenoceptor (ADRB3). This third type of ADRB is shown to be present and functional in human myometrium. We demonstrated that ADRB3 agonists are able to inhibit in-vitro spontaneous contractions of myometrial strips, via a cyclic AMP-mediated pathway. Furthermore, we established that ADRB3 is the predominant subtype over the ADRB2 in human myometrium and that its expression is increased in near-term myometrium, compared to non-pregnant myometrium. Finally, we reported that contrary to ADRB2, the human myometrial ADRB3 is resistant to long-term agonist-induced desensitisation. These compelling data confirm the clinical potential interest of ADRB3 agonists in the pharmacological management of preterm labour.
BACKGROUND: The beta-3 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB3) is part of the adrenergic system, which is known to play a key role in energy metabolism. The association between the Trp64Arg variant in the ADRB3 and body mass index (BMI) has been widely examined, but previous studies have been small and results have been inconsistent. METHODS: We assessed the association between the ADRB3 Trp64Arg variant and BMI in a large UK population-based cohort of 4854 middle-aged men and women. We also performed a meta-analysis of 97 studies, involving 44 833 individuals, to place our findings in context. RESULTS: Although we found no significant difference in BMI (0.20 kg/m(2), P=0.40) between the Trp64Trp homozygotes and Arg64 allele carriers in our UK population-based cohort, the meta-analysis showed significant association between the Arg64Trp variant and BMI, with Arg64-allele carriers having a 0.24 kg/m(2) (P=0.0002) higher BMI compared with noncarriers. However, we also found substantial heterogeneity among the studies (P=2.2 x 10(-14)). The difference in East Asians (0.31 kg/m(2), P=0.001) was 3.9 times larger than that in Europeans in whom no significant association was observed (0.08 kg/m(2), P=0.36). This was consistent with the chronological cumulative decrease in the effect size, which decreased steadily in Europeans and reached nonsignificance after 11 studies in 1996. In East Asians, the cumulative effect size decreased after the first reports, but reached a steady state at a significant effect size of 0.24 kg/m(2) in 2000. Although the funnel plot indicated no apparent publication bias, smaller studies tended to report greater differences in BMI, compared with larger studies. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data suggest that the Trp64Arg ADRB3 genetic variant might be associated with BMI in East Asians, but not Europeans. More generally, our study shows the importance of meta-analyses in the field of genetic association studies for common traits. Each genetic variant makes only a small contribution to variation in BMI, and large sample sizes are needed to reliably assess and interpret gene-phenotype associations.
BACKGROUND: Previous studies demonstrated that ADRB3, beta-3 adrenergic receptor, participated in lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipose tissue. Consequently, this gene has attracted an increasing number of genetic studies examining its association with coronary artery disease (CAD) in different ethnicities in recent years, but no conclusion has been reached so far. The aim of this study was to explore whether the well-studied locus ADRB3 Trp64Arg in this gene confers a race-specific effect to CAD by conducting a stratified meta-analysis involving 15 independent studies and 11,802 subjects. METHODS: Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association. Publication bias was quantified and examined with Begg's funnel plot test and Egger's linear regression method. The overall meta-analysis or stratified meta-analysis by ethnicity was performed by using STATA 12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 15 eligible studies involving 5779 CAD cases and 6023 health controls were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of CAD. Further stratified analysis by ethnicity revealed that ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism was significantly associated with CAD in Asians (allelic: OR = 1.48, 95%CI 1.13-1.94, P = .005; homozygous: OR = 2.66, 95%CI 1.87-3.77, P < .001; recessive: OR = 2.46, 95%CI 1.74-3.47, P < .001), but not in Caucasians (allelic: OR = 1.09, 95%CI 0.93-1.27, P = .290; homozygous: OR = 1.31, 95%CI 0.61-2.86, P = .490; recessive: OR = 1.31, 95%CI 0.60-2.84, P = 2.494). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism confers a race-specific effect to CAD.
OBJECTIVES: The contribution of heritability to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of interest as the identification of genes enhancing the susceptibility of individuals to CVD may help the design of clinical interventions optimized for the individual's genome. METHODS: We studied the associations of polymorphism of ADRB3 and PPARgamma2 genes with obesity indices, unfavorable lipid profile parameters and insulin resistance index HOMA in 343 postmenopausal women. RESULTS: No association was found between tested polymorphisms and CVD risk factors such as total cholesterol >/= 5.0 mmol/l, high density lipoprotein cholesterol < 1.2 mmol/l, low density lipoprotein cholesterol > 3.0 mmol/l and triacylglycerols > 1.7 mmol/l. The presence of arterial hypertension and HOMA value >/= 1.95 were also not related to these polymorphisms. A significant association between PPARgamma2 gene polymorphism and total body fat mass (odds ratio = 1.90 at p = 0.037) as well as android fat deposit mass (odds ratio = 1.82 at p = 0.048) was found. CONCLUSIONS: CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women are not directly associated with the polymorphisms of PPARgamma2 and ADRB3 genes. We suggest that some indirect link between PPARgamma2 gene polymorphism and susceptibility of postmenopausal women to CVD may exist. This suggestion is based on our finding that high total body fat mass and high android fat deposits are associated with the presence of the Pro12Ala allele of the PPARgamma2 gene.
BACKGROUND: The aim of the research genetic study was to investigate the association between variants (C1431T and Pro12Ala) of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma-2) gene, Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta-3-adrenergic receptor gene and lipid profile in Polish population including group of 103 patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) and 103 sex-and age-matched controls in context of statin use. METHODS: Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured by routine methods, followed by genotyping (TagMan((R)) Genotyping Assays, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis). Nearly 30% of CTD patients used statins and 10% of the control group. RESULTS: Although there were no differences between alleles and genotypes prevalence between CTD vs control groups, interesting lipid-gene associations were noted in this study. A higher level of triglycerides (TAG) and TAG/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratios was observed in CTD patients compared to controls. Similar differences were noted in CTD and control groups without statin treatment. Atherogenic markers: the atherogenic index of plasma, TAG/HDL and low-density lipoprotein/HDL ratio were low in the analyzed groups. Of the six analyzed polymorphisms, the Pro12Pro or C14131C or Trp64Trp genotypes were related to higher TAG and TAG/HDL ratios in patients with CTD; however, the highest TAG values were observed in the presence of the Trp64Trp genotype. CONCLUSION: Lipid disorders were present in both groups independent of statin treatment (mixed dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia were observed in the CTD and control groups, respectively). The risk of dyslipidemia increases with age. The presence of Pro12Pro, C14131C and Trp64Trp genotypes is related to higher TAG level in CTDs, and of these the Trp64Trp variant most reliably predicts hypertriglyceridemia.
Objective: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a the most common type of heart disease, and is associated with the highest mortality rate. The role of the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB3) in energy homeostasis and lipolysis suggests that it may be associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hypertension. Herein, we sought to examine the relationship between CAD and variants of the ADRB3 gene in individuals with Han and Uygur ethnicities in China. Methods: All 1022 participants were genotyped for two ADRB3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs1892818 and rs9693898) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan). Uygur (259 CAD patients, 161 control group) and Han (308 CAD patients, 294 control group) were included in two case-control studies. We subsequently developed a predictive model using ADRB3 genetic variation and clinical variables to predict risk of CAD. Results: The rs1892818 CT genotype (8.5% vs 3.9%, p = 0.019) and T allele (4.3% vs 1.9%, p = 0.021) were more frequently detected in the control subjects compared to CAD patients of the Han population but not in the Uygur population. The rs9693898 was not associated with CAD in either ethnic population. Logistic regression analysis further demonstrated that carriers of the rs1892818 CT genotype had a lower risk of CAD than did those with the CC genotype (CT vs CC, p = 0.044, odds ratio [OR] = 0.441, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.199-0.976). Using this data, we constructed a predictive nomogram model for CAD with an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.722 (0.682, 0.761). Conclusions: Our results suggest that rs1892818 is associated with CAD in the Han population and that the CT genotype of rs1892818 may serve as a protective factor for CAD in Han individuals. The proposed nomograms can be used for the prediction of CAD in this population.
PURPOSE: Adrenergic and cholinergic pathways play an important role in contraction-relaxation harmony in human bladder. Functional changes in any proteins in these pathways may result in overactive bladder. We aimed to investigate whether single gene polymorphisms affecting adrenergic and cholinergic pathways are associated with OAB syndrome. METHODS: 60 patients with idiopathic OAB and 60 healthy controls were included in the study. A validated OAB-V8 questionnaire was given to all patients. Polymorphisms of ADRB3, ROCK2, and GEF gene were detected by PCR from whole blood samples. Genotypic structures of patients and controls were compared. The relationship between genotypic structures and OAB symptom scores were investigated. RESULTS: We found no significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between the patients and controls for all three SNP. While there was no relationship between ADRB3 and GEF gene polymorphisms and OAB scores in OAB patients, the OAB score in heterozygous polymorphic individuals was significantly higher than in homozygous polymorphic individuals in the ROCK2 gene (p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: The polymorphisms of the ADRB3, ROCK2, and GEF genes were present in both OAB group and healthy controls, but were not associated with OAB syndrome.
BACKGROUND: Defects in DNA methylation have been shown to be associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia. To analyze the methylation profile of the ADRB3 gene and correlate it with lipid profile, lipid intake, and oxidative stress based on malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), homocysteine and folic acid levels, nutritional status, lifestyle, and socioeconomic variables in an adult population. A cross-sectional epidemiological study representative of the East and West regions of the municipality of Joao Pessoa, Paraiba state, Brazil, enrolled 265 adults of both genders. Demographic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic questionnaires and a 24-h recall questionnaire were applied by trained interviewers' home. Nutritional and biochemical evaluation (DNA methylation, lipid profile, MDA, TAC, homocysteine and folic acid levels) was performed. RESULTS: DNA hypermethylation of the ADRB3 gene, analyzed in leukocytes, was present in 50% of subjects and was associated with a higher risk of being overweight (OR 3.28; p = 0.008) or obese (OR 3.06; p = 0.017), a higher waist-hip ratio in males (OR 1.17; p = 0.000), greater intake of trans fats (OR 1.94; p = 0.032), higher LDL (OR 2.64; p = 0.003) and triglycerides (OR 1.81; p = 0.031), and higher folic acid levels (OR 1.85; p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that epigenetic changes in the ADRB3 gene locus may explain the development of obesity and non-communicable diseases associated with trans-fat intake, altered lipid profile, and elevated folic acid. Because of its persistence, DNA methylation may have an impact in adults, in association with the development of non-communicable diseases. This study is the first population-based study of the ADRB3 gene, and the data further support evaluation of ADRB3 DNA methylation as an effective biomarker.
AIM: ADRB3 DNA hypermethylation was recently associated with dyslipidemia in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this study, we verified whether ADRB3 DNA methylation in blood and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was associated with obesity and its related complications. METHODS: DNA methylation levels were measured in the blood of 61 FH men, and the blood and VAT of 30 severely obese men. Common ADRB3 polymorphisms were genotyped in all subjects. RESULTS: Higher ADRB3 DNA methylation levels were significantly associated with lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = -0.40; p = 0.01) in FH, and with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (r = -0.55; p = 0.01) and higher blood pressure (r = 0.43; p = 0.05) in severely obese men. ADRB3 g.-843C>T and p.W64R polymorphisms were found to be strongly associated (p < 0.001) with ADRB3 DNA methylation and mRNA levels. CONCLUSION: Although further studies are needed, these results suggest that epigenetic changes at the ADRB3 gene locus might be involved in the development of obesity and its related metabolic complications.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the Trp64Arg polymorphism in the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB3: rs4994) and BMI and serological and anthropometric data in healthy Japanese. METHODS: Healthy Japanese recruited in a large-scale integrated manufacturing facility in Japan (N = 1355; age: 37.25 +/- 9.43; BMI: 22.86 +/- 3.46) were eligible for analysis. The anthropometric data and serological data were measured during a comprehensive health check, and a self-reporting questionnaire was used to assess lifestyle habits (current exercise, smoking status, alcohol intake, and working style) and weight at age 20. Genotyping for the ADRB3 polymorphism was performed by PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Among 1355 participants, the genotype frequencies of the Trp/Trp, Trp/Arg, and Arg/Arg variants were 920 (67.9%), 394 (29.1%), and 41 (3.05%), respectively. In the multivariate analysis, a multiple linear regression model in men for the adjustment of age, drinking habits, smoking habits, exercise habits, working status and serological measurements statistically showed an overall weak significance between annual BMI gain from age 20 and age, LDL or ADRB3 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: The level of LDL, age, and ADRB3 polymorphism (Arg/Arg genotype) were statistically associated with annual BMI gain in Japanese men.
BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease and cause of heart attacks. It has been proposed that both the susceptibility to disease and the interindividual variability in response to treatment relates in part to genetic polymorphisms, particularly those polymorphisms for neurotransmitter and drug receptors. Common functional polymorphisms in beta-adrenergic receptor genes (ADRB) have been associated with heart failure phenotypes. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to explore the association of genetic variants in ADRB3 (C190T or Trp64Arg) ADRB1 (C1165G or Arg389Gly), and ADRA2A (C-1291G) with CAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study recruited a total of 600 consecutive patients with angiographically confirmed CAD and 200 population-matched controls (173 men and 27 women) (mean age 54.10+/-8.30 years). The ADRB3 T190C, ADRA2A C-1291G, and ADRB1 C1165G polymorphisms were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The putative functional effects were determined in the coding region of the ADRD3 gene by online web servers FASTSNP and F-SNP. RESULTS: On comparing the genotype frequency distribution in CAD patients with that of healthy individuals, significant association was observed with the CC genotype of the ADRB3 T190C polymorphism (P=0.040, odds ratio=1.5). Also, at the allelic level the C allele of ADRB3 T190C conferred risk for CAD (P=0.005, odds ratio=1.7). The ADRA2A C-1291G and ADRB1 C1165G polymorphisms were not found to be a risk for CAD when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The present study finding suggests that ADRB3 C190T may also be involved in the complex pathophysiology of CAD.
