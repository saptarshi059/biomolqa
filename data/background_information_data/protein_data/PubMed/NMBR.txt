Neuromedin-B receptor; Receptor for neuromedin-B.
BACKGROUND: We investigated phosphodiesterase 7B (PDE7B), neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) and epilepsy progressive myoclonus type 2A (EPM2A) genes in schizophrenia (SCZ). To the best of our knowledge, these genes have been poorly investigated in studies of SCZ. METHODS: Five hundred and seventy-three SCZ inpatients of Korean ethnicity and 560 healthy controls were genotyped for 2 PDE7B, 3 NMBR and 3 EPM2A polymorphisms. Differences in the allelic and genetic frequencies among healthy subjects and patients were calculated using the x03C7;2 statistics. Repeated-measure ANOVA was used to test possible influences of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on treatment efficacy. In case of positive findings, clinical and demographic variables were added as covariates, in order to investigate possible stratixFB01;cation bias. RESULTS: The rs2717 and rs6926279 within the NMBR gene and rs702304 and rs2235481 within the EPM2A gene were associated with SCZ liability. rs1415744 was also associated with Positive and Negative Symptom Scale negative clinical improvement. The results remained the same after inclusion of the covariates and were partially confirmed in the allelic and haplotype analyses. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest a possible role of NMBR and EPM2A genes in SCZ susceptibility and, for the second one, also in antipsychotic pharmacogenetics. Nonetheless, further research is needed to conxFB01;rm our findings.
