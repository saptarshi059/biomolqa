Solute carrier family 22 member 9; Sodium-independent organic anion transporter which exhibits high specificity for sulfated conjugates of xenobiotics and steroid hormones. It is also specifically activated by 3 to 5 carbons- containing short-chain fatty acids/SCFAs, including propionate, butyrate and valerate. May operate the exchange of sulfated organic components against short-chain fatty acids/SCFAs at the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes; Belongs to the major facilitator (TC 2.A.1) superfamily. Organic cation transporter (TC 2.A.1.19) family.
Human organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7, SLC22A9) is a hepatic transport protein poorly characterized so far. We therefore sought to identify novel OAT7 substrates and factors contributing to variable hepatic OAT7 expression. Using OAT7-expressing cells, pravastatin was identified as a substrate. Hepatic SLC22A9/OAT7 mRNA and protein expression varied 28-fold and 15-fold, respectively, in 126 Caucasian liver samples. Twenty-four variants in SLC22A9 were genotyped, including three rare missense variants (rs377211288, rs61742518, rs146027075), which occurred only heterozygously. No variant significantly affected hepatic SLC22A9/OAT7 expression. The three missense variants, however, showed functional consequences when expressed in vitro. Hepatic nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4alpha) emerged as a major transcriptional regulator of SLC22A9 by a series of in silico and in vitro analyses. In conclusion, pravastatin is the first identified OAT7 drug substrate. Substantial inter-individual variability in hepatic OAT7 expression, majorly driven by HNF4alpha, may contribute to pravastatin drug disposition and might affect response.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 4 August 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.55.
Bone production, maintenance, and modeling are a well-balanced process involving mineralization by osteoblasts and resorption by osteoclasts. Sex steroid hormones, including their conjugated forms, contribute majorly to maintaining this balance. Recently, variants in the SLC22A9 gene have been associated with osteoporosis in Korean females. We had recently shown that SLC22A9, encoding organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7), is an uptake transporter of estrone sulfate and identified several genetic variants in Europeans leading to functional consequences in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that SLC22A9 genetic variants may contribute to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis in Europeans. To test this hypothesis, we examined the associations of SLC22A9 variants with bone quality, fractures, and bone turnover markers. We genotyped SLC22A9 variants in 5,701 (2,930 female) subjects (age range, 20-93 years) extracted from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP and SHIP-TREND) covered by the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip version v1.0 (Exome Chip). Descriptive data (e.g., history of fractures), ultrasonography of the calcaneus, as well as serum concentrations of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, and vitamin D were determined. Comprehensive statistical analyses revealed no association between low-frequency and rare SLC22A9 variants and bone quality, fractures, and bone turnover markers. Our results indicate that single genetic SLC22A9 variants do not have a major impact on osteoporosis risk prediction in Europeans, yet findings need to be replicated in larger-scale studies.
