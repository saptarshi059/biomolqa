Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3; After binding acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane.
Lifespan is a trait of enormous personal interest. Research into the biological basis of human lifespan, however, is hampered by the long time to death. Using a novel approach of regressing (272,081) parental lifespans beyond age 40 years on participant genotype in a new large data set (UK Biobank), we here show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan. The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE varepsilon4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan (P=4.2 x 10(-15), effect -1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent; sex difference, P=0.011), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affecting paternal lifespan (P=4.8 x 10(-11), effect -0.86 years per allele; sex difference P=0.075). Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.3-3.7 years shorter lives.
The alpha4-subunit gene (CHRNA4) of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit family has recently been identified in two families as the gene responsible for autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), a rare monogenic idiopathic epilepsy. As a result of this finding, other subunits of the neuronal nAChR gene family are being considered as candidate genes for ADNFLE in families not linked to CHRNA4 and for other idiopathic epilepsies. Alpha4-subunits often assemble together with beta2-subunits (gene symbol CHRNB2) to build heteromeric nAChRs. The gene encoding another abundant AChR subunit, the alpha3-subunit gene (CHRNA3), is present with those encoding two other subunits, CHRNB4 and CHRNA5, in a gene cluster whose functional role is still unclear. Here we provide the information on the genomic structures of both the CHRNB2 and the CHRNA3 genes that is necessary for comprehensive mutational analyses, and we refine the genomic assignment of CHRNB2 on chromosome 1.
The chromosome 15q24 region, containing the CHRNA3/A5/B4 gene cluster, coding for the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has been reported to be linked to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) in one family. However, nor the gene nor the mutation involved have been identified. We report the refined mapping of CHRNA3/A5/B4 cluster. Segregation analyses of CHRNA3/A5/B4 polymorphisms in families showing recombinations for 15q24 G inverted question marken inverted question markethon STR markers allowed to position the cluster in a 0.6 cM interval, between STRs D15S1027 and D15S1005. This location is external to the 15q24-ADNFLE-linked region, therefore excluding the involvement of this cluster in the pathogenesis of ADNFLE in the 15q24-linked family. Moreover, these data provide more precise information for further linkage studies.
A genome-wide association study has identified the 15q25 region as being associated with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Caucasians. This study intended as a confirmatory assessment of this association in a Korean population. The rs6495309C > T polymorphism in the promoter of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit 3 (CHRNA3) gene was investigated in a case-control study that consisted of 406 patients with COPD and 394 healthy control subjects. The rs6495309 CT or TT genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of COPD when compared to the rs6495309 CC genotype (adjusted odds ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.95, P = 0.023). The effect of the rs6495309C > T on the risk of COPD was more evident in moderate to very severe COPD than in mild COPD under a dominant model for the variant T allele (P = 0.024 for homogeneity). The CHRNA3 rs6495309C > T polymorphism on chromosome 15q25 is associated with the risk of COPD in a Korean population.
Smoking is a chronic and relapsing addictive trait that harms public health. Among the many identified genetic variants of nicotine dependence, the variants in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster on chromosome 15 that encode the alpha5, alpha3, and beta4 subunits have recently received a lot of attention. Importantly, variants in this gene cluster have been associated with nicotine addiction. Among the many significant variants in this cluster, the polymorphism SNP rs16969968 seems to be the most interesting factor in nicotine addiction. This polymorphism causes an amino acid change from aspartate to asparagine at position 398 of the alpha5 nicotinic receptor protein sequence. Our study aimed to analyze three polymorphic variants: the rs16969968 located in the CHRNA5 gene, the rs578776 and rs1051730 located in the CHRNA3 gene in nicotine-addicted subjects, and in controls. Our study encompasses an association analysis of genotypes and haplotypes. A group of 401 volunteers was recruited for the study and divided into two groups: the study group consisted of addicted smokers and a control group of 200 unrelated non-smokers who were not dependent on any substance and healthy. A statistically significant difference was observed in the frequency of genotypes of the rs1051730 polymorphism of the CHRNA3 gene (chi(2) = 6.704 p = 0.035). The T/T genotype was statistically significantly more frequent in the group of nicotine-dependent subjects. The haplotypes rs16969968, rs578776, and rs1051730 were distinguished, of which the G-T-T and G-C-T haplotypes were present only in the study group. With differences in frequencies, statistical significance was noted-for the G-T-T haplotype p = 0.01284 and the G-C-T haplotype p = 0.00775. The research stated that novel haplotypes G-T-T and G-C-T, though with very low-frequency variants in CHRNA3, were associated with nicotine addiction.
OBJECTIVE: The genetic polymorphism (rs16969968 in CHRNA5, and rs1051730 in CHRNA3 genes) were recently shown to be associated with risk of LC. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether they predispose Palestinian individuals to lung cancer, and how is this related to smoking. RESULTS: Frequency of the rs16969968-A allele was significantly higher in the case group (36.7%) than in normal controls (17.5%; P = 0.022; OR = 6.83 for AA and 2.81 for AG genotypes). The frequency of rs1051730-T allele was also significantly higher in the case group (46.7%) than in the control group (22.5%; P = 0.001; OR = 2.20 for TC and 13.22 for TT genotypes). Frequency of rs16969968-A allele was higher in smokers (29.1%) than nonsmokers (15.7%) regardless of lung cancer; similarly, frequency of rs1051730-T allele was also higher in smokers than in smokers (46.7% vs 22.5%, respectively). The higher the proportion of the risk allele (rs16969968-A and rs1051730-T), the higher the mean number of daily consumed cigarettes (P = 0.006). Carrying rs16969968-A and/or rs1051730-T alleles results in an increased risk to lung cancer probably by increasing the individual's tendency for heavy smoking. The allelic frequency of the rs16969968-A and rs1051730-T alleles among normal Palestinian controls is similar to different populations worldwide.
Genome-wide association studies implicate variations in CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 as being associated with nicotine addiction (NA). Multiple common haplotypes ("risk", "mixed" and "protective") exist in Europeans; however, high linkage disequilibrium between variations in CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 makes assigning causative allele(s) for NA difficult through genotyping experiments alone. We investigated whether CHRNA5 or CHRNA3 promoter haplotypes, associated previously with NA, might influence allelic expression levels. For in vitro analyses, promoter haplotypes were sub-cloned into a luciferase reporter vector. When assessed in BE(2)-C cells, luciferase expression was equivalent among CHRNA3 haplotypes, but the combination of deletion at rs3841324 and variation at rs503464 decreased CHRNA5 promoter-derived luciferase activity, possibly due to loss of an SP-1 and other site(s). Variation within the CHRNA5 5'UTR at rs55853698 and rs55781567 also altered luciferase expression in BE(2)-C cells. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) from the "risk" or "protective" haplotypes was assessed in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals heterozygous at coding polymorphisms in CHRNA3 (rs1051730) or CHRNA5 (rs16969968). In most cases, equivalent allelic expression was observed; however, one individual showed CHRNA5 AEI that favored the "protective" allele and that was concordant with heterozygosity at polymorphisms  approximately 13.5 kb upstream of the CHRNA5 transcription start site. Putative enhancer activity from these distal promoter elements was assessed using heterologous promoter constructs. We observed no differences in promoter activity from the two distal promoter haplotypes examined, but found that the distal promoter region strongly repressed transcription. We conclude that CHRNA5 promoter variants may affect relative risk for NA in some heterozygous individuals.
BACKGROUND: Cigarette consumption has been identified as the main non-etiological factor in head and neck cancer (HNC) development. One of the main compounds in cigarettes is nicotine, which binds directly to nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) in the body, which are encoded by different genes of the CHRNA family. Polymorphisms in some of these genes have been studied in relation to the risk of HNC and cigarette consumption intensity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there were associations between the CHRNA3 (rs578776) and CHRNA5 (rs16969968) polymorphisms and HNC risk and between the polymorphisms and the intensity of cigarette consumption. METHODS: A total of 1,067 individuals from Heliopolis Hospital in Sao Paulo were investigated, including 619 patients with HNC and 448 patients without diagnosed tumors. All participants answered a questionnaire about sociodemographic information and cigarette consumption data. The polymorphisms were determined by TaqMan genotyping by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The polymorphisms studied, rs578776 (CHRNA3) and rs16969968 (CHRNA5), did not have an association with HNC risk, but the rs16969968 homozygous genotype was associated with increased cigarette consumption intensity (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.05-3.58). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism CHRNA5 can be considered an indirect risk factor for neoplasms in these Brazilian samples when cigarette consumption increased.
Polymorphisms in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA5/CHRNA3 locus) have been associated with several smoking related traits such as nicotine dependence, cigarette consumption, smoking cessation, lung cancer, and COPD. The aim of this candidate gene study was to study the locus among the Finnish COPD patients and long-term smokers with regard to COPD risk, smoking behavior, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Genotyping of rs1051730, the locus tagging SNP was done in two longitudinal cohorts: Finnish COPD patients (N = 575, 74% men) and long-term smokers, all men (N = 1911). Finnish population sample (N = 1730) was used as controls. The analyses were done using logistic and Cox regression. The main findings were that the minor allele increased the risk of COPD when compared to the Finnish population at large (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7, p = 3.2 x 10-5). Homozygosity for the risk allele was associated in both cohorts with all-cause mortality (crude HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.8 and 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, respectively), with any type of cancer (crude OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.1) among the COPD patients and with the number of pack-years (crude OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) among the male smokers. CHRNA5/CHRNA3 locus tagged by rs1051730, which has been previously associated with several smoking related diseases was now shown to be associated also with increased all-cause mortality among long-term smokers with or without clinical COPD further emphasizing the clinical importance of the finding.
Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for hypertension. However, the effects on hypertension of the interaction between smoking and the genotype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene are unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the CHRNA3 rs6495308 genotype affects the association between daily cigarette consumption and hypertension. We recruited 947 male smokers in southern China and used a questionnaire administered in face to face interviews to obtain information on their socio-demographic characteristics and smoking behavior. Blood samples were collected to test for CHRNA3 rs6495308 genotype variations. Three blood-pressure measurements were taken for each participant, and the average values recorded. We found that, compared with light smoking (<15 cigarettes per day), heavy smoking (>/=15 cigarettes per day) yielded a greater risk of hypertension. We also observed that the interaction between daily cigarette consumption and the CHRNA3 rs6495308 genotype may affect hypertension. Heavy smokers with the homozygous mutant CHRNA3 rs6495308 genotype exhibited a significantly greater risk of hypertension than light smokers with wild-type CHRNA3 rs6495308 genotypes. The positive interaction between heavy smoking and the homozygous mutant CHRNA3 rs6495308 genotype was found to affect the likelihood of hypertension in Chinese male smokers.
BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly in China. Genetic predisposition is a recognized risk factor for COPD, with CHRNA3 emerging as a promising candidate gene due to its involvement in smoking behavior and lung function. This study aimed to investigate the association between eight CHRNA3 SNPs and COPD susceptibility in the Chinese elderly population. METHODS: A total of 270 COPD patients and 271 healthy controls were included in the study. SNP genotyping was carried out using the Agena MassARRAY platform. Logistic regression analysis was employed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between the SNPs and COPD risk. Forest plots were generated using Sangerbox software to visually represent the association results. Additionally, haplotype blocks were constructed using Haploview 4.2 software to explore the potential impact of haplotypes on COPD risk. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that rs615470, rs660652, and rs472054 are associated with a reduced risk of COPD, while rs8040868 is associated with an increased risk. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis identified a haplotype block encompassing rs76071148, rs615470, rs660652, rs472054 and rs578776. Notably, the haplotype TTAAG was associated with a reduced risk of COPD. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into the genetic susceptibility of COPD among the elderly, particularly regarding the role of SNPs in CHRNA3. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of COPD and may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for COPD.
Genome-wide association studies and integrative genomics approaches have demonstrated significant associations between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 15q25 region that includes iron-responsive element binding protein 2 gene (IREB2) and CHRNA3/5 in non-Asian populations. We investigated whether IREB2 and CHRNA3/5 polymorphisms would be associated with COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes in a Chinese Han population. Eight SNPs (rs2568494, rs2656069, rs10851906, rs1964678, rs12593229, rs965604, rs13180, rs17483929) in IREB2 gene and four SNPs (rs16969968, rs1051730, rs938682, rs8034191) in or near CHRNA3/5 locus were genotyped in a case-control study (680 COPD patients and 687 controls). No significant associations were found between any of the SNPs and COPD in either former-smokers or current-smokers. Two SNPs (rs2656069 and rs10851906) in IREB2 were associated with COPD (P=0.045 and 0.032, respectively) in non-smoker. Four SNPs (rs1964678, rs12593229, rs965604 and rs13180) in IREB2 were associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))% predicted and three SNPs (rs16969968, rs8034191 and rs1051730) in CHRNA3/5 were both associated with FEV(1)% predicted and FEV(1)/FVC in COPD cases (P range 0.007-0.050). The SNP rs8034191 near CHRNA3/5 locus was significantly associated with pack-years of smoking in COPD patients (P=0.033). We demonstrated IREB2 polymorphisms were associated with COPD in non-smoking subjects, and the effect of IREB2 gene on COPD may be independent from smoking and independent from CHRNA3/5 gene cluster. Besides, we confirmed that SNPs in these two gene loci were associated with pulmonary function and CHRNA3/5 polymorphism was associated with pack-year of smoking in COPD patients in the Chinese Han population.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular basis of a new monogenetic recessive disorder that results in familial autonomic ganglionopathy with diffuse autonomic failure. METHODS: Two adult siblings from one family (I-4 and I-5) and another participant from a second family (II-3) presented with severe neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), small nonreactive pupils, and constipation. All 3 affected members had low norepinephrine levels and diffuse panautonomic failure. RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing of DNA from I-4 and I-5 showed compound heterozygosity for c.907_908delCT (p.L303Dfs*115)/c.688 G>A (p.D230N) pathologic variants in the acetylcholine receptor, neuronal nicotinic, alpha3 subunit gene (CHRNA3). II-3 from the second family was homozygous for the same frameshift (fs) variant (p.L303Dfs*115//p.L303Dfs*115). CHRNA3 encodes a critical subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) responsible for fast synaptic transmission in the autonomic ganglia. The fs variant is clearly pathogenic and the p.D230N variant is predicted to be damaging (SIFT)/probably damaging (PolyPhen2). The p.D230N variant lies on the interface between CHRNA3 and other nAChR subunits based on structural modeling and is predicted to destabilize the nAChR pentameric complex. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel genetic disease that affected 3 individuals from 2 unrelated families who presented with severe nOH, miosis, and constipation. These patients had rare pathologic variants in the CHRNA3 gene that cosegregate with and are predicted to be the likely cause of their diffuse panautonomic failure.
We examined the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or lung function with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in a novel cohort of patients with severe to very severe COPD. We examined 315 cases of COPD and 330 Caucasian control smokers from Poland. We included three SNPs previously associated with COPD: rs7671167 (FAM13A), rs13180 (IREB2), and rs8034191 (CHRNA 3/5), and four SNPs associated with lung function in a genome-wide association study of general population samples: rs2070600 (AGER), rs11134242 (ADCY2), rs4316710 (THSD4), and rs17096090 (INTS12). We tested for associations with severe COPD and COPD-related phenotypes, including lung function, smoking behavior, and body mass index. Subjects with COPD were older (average age 62 versus 58 years, P < 0.01), with more pack-years of smoking (45 versus 33 pack-years, P < 0.01). CHRNA3/5 (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.4; P = 7.4 x 10(-7)), IREB2 (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; P = 3.4 x 10(-3)), and ADCY2 (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; P = 0.01) demonstrated significant associations with COPD. FAM13A (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; P = 0.11) approached statistical significance. FAM13A and ADCY2 also demonstrated a significant association with lung function. Thus, in severe to very severe COPD, we demonstrate a replication of association between two SNPs previously associated with COPD (CHRNA3/5 and IREB2), as well as an association with COPD of one locus initially associated with lung function (ADCY2).
A lifetime history of alcohol dependence has been associated with elevations in neuroticism in Mexican American young adults. The identification of genetic markers associated with neuroticism and their influence on the development of alcohol use disorders (AUD) may contribute to our understanding of the relationship between personality traits and the increased risk of AUD in Mexican Americans. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between neuroticism and 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) alpha5-subunit (CHRNA5) and alpha3-subunit (CHRNA3) genes in young adult Mexican American men and women. Participants were 465 young adult Mexican American men and women who are literate in English and are residing legally in San Diego County. Each participant gave a blood sample and completed a structured diagnostic interview. Neuroticism was assessed using the Maudsley Personality Inventory. The minor alleles of four CHRNA5 polymorphisms (rs588765, rs601079, rs680244 and rs555018) and three CHRNA3 polymorphisms (rs578776, rs6495307 and rs3743078) showed associations with neuroticism. Several of these SNPs also displayed nominal associations with DSM-IV alcohol and nicotine dependence, but tests of mediation suggested that these relations could be partially explained by the presence of co-occurring neuroticism. These findings suggest that genetic variations in nicotinic receptor genes may influence the development of neuroticism, which in turn is involved in the development of AUDs and nicotine dependence in Mexican American young adults.
Functionally related genes often cluster into a genome region under coordinated regulation, forming a local regulome. To understand regulation of the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 nicotinic receptor gene cluster, we integrate large-scale RNA expression data (brain and peripheral) from GTEx (Genotype Tissue Expression), clinical associations (GRASP), and linkage disequilibrium data (1000 Genomes) to find candidate SNPs representing independent regulatory variants. CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB4 mRNAs, and a well-expressed CHRNA5 antisense RNA (RP11-650L12.2) are co-expressed in many human tissues, suggesting common regulatory elements. The CHRNA5 enhancer haplotype tagged by rs880395 not only increases CHRNA5 mRNA expression in all tissues, but also enhances RP11-650L12.2 and CHRNA3 expression, suggesting DNA looping to multiple promoters. However, in nucleus accumbens and putamen, but not other brain regions, CHRNA3 expression associates uniquely with a haplotype tagged by rs1948 (located in the CHRNB4 3'UTR). Haplotype/diplotype analysis of rs880395 and rs1948 plus rs16969968 (a nonsynonymous CHRNA5 risk variant) in GWAS (COGEND, UW-TTURC, SAGE) yields a nicotine dependence risk profile only partially captured by rs16969968 alone. An example of local gene clusters, this nicotinic regulome is controlled by complex genetic variation, with broad implications for interpreting GWAS.
OBJECTIVE: Genetic variations are most likely an additional risk factor besides tobacco smoking per se for the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we compared genetic variants influencing the effect of smoking on COPD, that is, the effect of the well-known splicing defect polymorphism, CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), identified before genome-wide association studies, with the genome-wide association studies identified CHRNA3 (rs1051730) polymorphism on the risk of decreased lung function and COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 10 605 participants from the general population were genotyped. Information on spirometry, hospital admissions and smoking behaviour was recorded. Endpoints were lung function and COPD. RESULTS: For CHRNA3, the percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%) predicted was 89.3, 90.6 and 92.4% in homozygous, heterozygous and noncarrier ever-smokers (P-trend<0.001). The corresponding values for forced vital capacity percentage (FVC%) predicted were 94.5, 95.2 and 96.7% (P-trend<0.001), and for FEV1/FVC ratio, the values were 0.753, 0.760 and 0.764 (P-trend=0.008). The odds ratio for COPD in homozygous versus noncarrier ever-smokers was 1.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-1.9] for COPD hospitalization, 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.6) for COPD defined as FEV1/FVC less than lower limit of normal, 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.5) for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease category 1-4 (GOLD 1-4), 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.5) for GOLD 2-4 and 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.2) for GOLD 3-4. This association could not be found in never-smokers. No association was found for CYP3A5*3. CONCLUSION: The CHRNA3 genotype is associated with decreased lung function and risk of COPD among ever-smokers, whereas this was not the case for CYP3A5*3.
BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex illness that can be attributed to the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The nicotinic receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15 has a plausible association with SUD, particularly with nicotine dependence. METHODS: This study investigated 15 SNPs within the CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 genes. Sequencing was used for genotyping 495 Jordanian males with SUD and 497 controls matched for age, gender, and descent. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that none of the tested alleles or genotypes were correlated with SUD. However, our analysis suggests that the route of substance use was linked to rs1051730 (P value = 0.04), rs8040868 (P value = 0.01) of CHRNA3, and rs16969968 (P value = 0.03) of CHRNA5. Additionally, a correlation was identified between rs3813567 of the CHRNB4 gene and the age at substance use onset (P value = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Variants in CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 may interact with SUD features that can influence the development and progression of the disorder among Jordanians.
