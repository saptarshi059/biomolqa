Pharmacogenetic studies revealed that variants in genes related to the pharmacokinetics of metformin were associated with glucose-lowering effect of metformin. The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations of the variants in genes encoding organic cationic transporters-solute carrier family 22, members A1, A2 (SLC22A1, SLC22A2) and solute carrier family 47, member A1 (SLC47A1) with response to metformin in type 2 diabetes. One hundred forty-eight drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. Genotyping for SLC22A1 rs622342, SLC22A2 rs316019 and SLC47A1 rs2289669 variants was performed using real-time PCR with subsequent melting-curve analysis. SLC47A1 rs2289669 genotype was significantly associated with the reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 6 months. Twenty percentage of patients with diabetes that are homozygous for A-allele of SLC47A1 had twofold reduction in HbA1c in comparison with the patients carrying G-allele (GG + GA: 0.55 +/- 0.09% vs. AA: 1.10 +/- 0.18%, p = 0.018). In conclusion, the results of this study might have in future practical implication in personalised treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.
CONTEXT: Although metformin is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, the blood sugar-lowering effect of metformin varies among populations. SLC47A1 plays an important role in metformin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between SLC47A1 rs2289669 (G > A) and the metformin response in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Studies published until January 27, 2022, were retrieved from Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Studies conducted in newly diagnosed or drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes who received metformin monotherapy were included. A total of 6 studies involving 953 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We extracted the study characteristics and changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels before and after treatment according to the SLC47A1 rs2289669 genotype. Changes in HbA1c levels were analyzed using mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. SLC47A1 rs2289669 was associated with changes in HbA1c levels (A carrier vs GG; MD = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.91 to - 0.20; I(2) = 63%). The sensitivity analysis yielded similar results to the main analysis (MD range, -0.64 to -0.37). When comparing all 3 genotypes, there were significant differences in HbA1c level changes between AA vs GG and GA vs GG, but not in GA vs AA. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that SLC47A1 rs2289669 is associated with the glycemic response to metformin in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.
Interindividual variation is important in the response to metformin as the first-line therapy for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Considering that OCT1 and MATE1 transporters determine the metformin pharmacokinetics, this study aimed to investigate the influence of SLC22A1 and SLC47A1 variants on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin and the glycemic response. This research used the prospective-cohort study design for 81 patients with T2DM who received 500 mg metformin twice a day from six primary healthcare centers. SLC22A1 rs628031 A>G (Met408Val) and Met420del genetic variants in OCT1 as well as SLC47A1 rs2289669 G>A genetic variant in MATE1 were examined through the PCR-RFLP method. The bioanalysis of plasma metformin was performed in the validated reversed-phase HPLC-UV detector. The metformin steady-state concentration was measured for the trough concentration (Cssmin) and peak concentration (Cssmax). The pharmacodynamic parameters of metformin use were the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated albumin (GA). Only SLC22A1 Met420del alongside estimated-glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) affected both Cssmax and Cssmin with an extremely weak correlation. Meanwhile, SLC47A1 rs2289669 and FBG were correlated. This study also found that there was no correlation between the three SNPs studied and GA, so only eGFR and Cssmax influenced GA. The average Cssmax in patients with the G allele of SLC22A1 Met408Val, reaching 1.35-fold higher than those with the A allele, requires further studies with regard to metformin safe dose in order to avoid exceeding the recommended therapeutic range.
Several pharmacogenetics studies have identified an association between a greater metformin-dependent reduction in HbA1c levels and the minor A allele at rs2289669 in intron 10 of SLC47A1, encoding multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1), a presumed metformin transporter. It is currently unknown if the rs2289669 locus is a cis-eQTL, which would validate its role as predictor of metformin efficacy. We looked at association between common genetic variants in the SLC47A1 gene region and HbA1c reduction after metformin treatment using locus-wise meta-analysis from the MetGen consortium. CRISPR-Cas9 was applied to perform allele editing of, or genomic deletion around, rs2289669 and of the closely linked rs8065082 in HepG2 cells. The genome-edited cells were evaluated for SLC47A1 expression and splicing. None of the common variants including rs2289669 showed significant association with metformin response. Genomic editing of either rs2289669 or rs8065082 did not alter SLC47A1 expression or splicing. Experimental and in silico analyses show that the rs2289669-containing haploblock does not appear to carry genetic variants that could explain its previously reported association with metformin efficacy.
Background This work aimed to evaluate the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC47A1 (922-158G>A; rs2289669) and SLC47A2 (-130G>A; rs12943590) genes on the relative change in HbA1c in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients of South India who are taking metformin as monotherapy. It also aims to study the effects of these SNPs on the dose requirement of metformin for glycemic control and the adverse effects of metformin. Methods Diabetes patients on metformin monotherapy were recruited based on the eligibility criteria (n=105). DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed with a real-time PCR system using TaqMan(R) SNP genotyping assay method. The HbA1c levels were measured using Bio-Rad D-10 Hemoglobin Analyzer. Results After adjusting for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction) the difference found in the glycemic response between the "GG" genotype and "AG/AA" genotype groups of the SLC47A2 gene was not significant (p=0.027; which was greater than the critical value of 0.025). Patients with "GG" genotype showed a 5.5% decrease in HbA1c from baseline compared to those with the "AG/AA" genotype (0.1% increase). The SNP in the SLC47A1 gene also did not influence the glycemic response to metformin (p=0.079). The median dose requirements based on the genotypes of the rs12943590 variant (p=0.357) or rs2289669 variant (p=0.580) were not significantly different. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse effects across the genotypes in both the SLC47A1 (p=0.615) and SLC47A2 (p=0.309) genes. Conclusions The clinical response to metformin was not associated with the SNPs in the SLC47A1 and SLC47A2 genes coding for the multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) transporters. Furthermore, the studied SNPs had no influence on the dose requirement or adverse effects of metformin.
BACKGROUND: Multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) is an organic cation/H+ exchanger, localized in the apical membrane of proximal renal tubules, which mediates the cellular elimination of organic cations into the renal lumen. These organic cations include clinically important drugs such as metformin, oxaliplatin and cimetidine. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms of SLC47A1, the pharmacogenetically relevant gene encoding human MATE1, have been implicated in reduced transport or accumulation to cytotoxic levels of these drugs in vitro. However, little or no information is available on the minor allele frequency distribution of known SLC47A1 coding SNPs in the sub-Saharan African populations. METHODS: Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the baseline minor allele frequency distribution of 20 known coding SNPs in the SLC47A1 gene of 148 Xhosa individuals residing in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: This study did not identify any of these known SLC47A1 coding SNPs in the Xhosa individuals who participated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: It is anticipated that whole genome or exome sequencing may reveal novel SNPs in the Xhosa and other sub-Saharan African populations, which may have been missed with the current genotyping strategy.
Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), which is encoded by solute carrier 47A1 (SLC47A1), mediates the excretion of organic cations into bile and urine. Some genetic variants in human MATE1 altered its transport function in in vitro experiments; however, differences in the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs cannot be explained by genetic variations in humans. In this study, we investigated whether DNA methylation was involved in interindividual variability in MATE1 expression in the human liver. Approximately 20-fold interindividual variability in MATE1 mRNA expression levels was observed in liver samples and mRNA expression levels negatively correlated with methylation levels of the CpG island in the 27 kb upstream of SLC47A1 DNA demethylation by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased MATE1 mRNA expression in MATE1-negative cell lines. The luciferase reporter assay showed that the CpG island increased the transcriptional activity of the SLC47A1 promoter. MATE1 mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in CpG island knockout HepG2 cells than in control cells. These results suggest that the 5' CpG island of SLC47A1 acts as an enhancer for SLC47A1, and DNA methylation in the CpG island plays an important role in interindividual differences in hepatic MATE1 expression.
AIMS: The SLC47A1 gene encodes the multi-drug and toxic excretion-1(MATE1) protein, which plays a key role in the transport and excretion of metformin. This study is to clarify the influence of variants in SLC47A1 (rs2289669 G-->A) on metformin pharmacokinetics and the long-term glucose-lowering effect of metformin. METHODS: A total of 220 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients were recruited, genotyped and divided into three groups by SLC47A1 genotypes (G/G, G/A, A/A). Ten patients in each group were randomly selected for metformin pharmacokinetics. All the participants received metformin oral treatment and were followed for one year. RESULTS: After one-year follow-up, the decline of HbA1c level was significantly greater in subjects with variant genotype (AA) than other two groups (-2.32% [-25.4 mmol/mol] in AA vs. -1.16% [-12.7 mmol/mol] in GA, -1.07% [-11.7 mmol/mol] in GG, P<0.05). Then taking GG genotype as the referent, the association between AA genotype and change of HbA1c still existed after adjusted for age, sex, BMI, baseline HbA1c and diabetes duration (P<0.05). Pharmacokinetic parameters of metformin indicated that patients carrying MATE1 homozygous A had higher area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC12h), but lower renal clearance (CLR) and renal clearance by secretion (CLSR) than other patients (all P<0.01). Multivariate lineal stepwise analysis further revealed that SLC47A1 genotype was an independent impact factor for urine excretion of metformin (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: SLC47A1 rs2289669 G>A variants improve the glucose-lowering effect of metformin through slowing its excretion in type 2 diabetes populations.
The human multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporter 1 contributes to the tissue distribution and excretion of many drugs. Inhibition of MATE1 may result in potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and alterations in drug exposure and accumulation in various tissues. The primary goals of this project were to identify MATE1 inhibitors with clinical importance or in vitro utility and to elucidate the physicochemical properties that differ between MATE1 and OCT2 inhibitors. Using a fluorescence assay of ASP(+) uptake in cells stably expressing MATE1, over 900 prescription drugs were screened and 84 potential MATE1 inhibitors were found. We identified several MATE1 selective inhibitors including four FDA-approved medications that may be clinically relevant MATE1 inhibitors and could cause a clinical DDI. In parallel, a QSAR model identified distinct molecular properties of MATE1 versus OCT2 inhibitors and was used to screen the DrugBank in silico library for new hits in a larger chemical space.
Renal elimination of a number of cationic compounds is thought to be mediated by the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2, SLC22A2), a drug uptake transporter expressed at the basolateral domain of renal tubular cells. Recently, the key efflux transporter for the secretion organic cations was identified as an electroneutral H(+)/organic cation exchanger termed the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-type transporter 1 (MATE1, SLC47A1). The key goals of this study were to assess the interplay between the renal cationic transporters OCT2 and MATE1 and the functional assessment of genetic variation in human MATE1. First, the ability of various agents to interact with OCT2- or MATE1-mediated transport was determined using a recombinant vaccinia expression system. We were able to identify several drugs in clinical use with a divergent inhibitory capacity for these transporters. Subsequently, we further assessed the effect of those compounds on the cellular accumulation of shared substrates using OCT2 and MATE1 double-transfected cells. Consistent with data obtained using single transporter transfected cells, compounds that exhibited preferential inhibition of MATE1 such as rapamycin and mitoxantrone induced significant cellular accumulation of cationic substrates. We next assessed the functional relevance of MATE1 genetic polymorphisms. Significant loss of transport activity for metformin and tetraethylammonium was noted for two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), c.404T>C (p.159T>M) and c.1012G>A (p.338V>A). The c.404T>C was only seen in Asian subjects with an allele frequency of 1%, and the c.1012G>A SNP was much more common, especially among those of African descent. In conclusion, we show that coordinate function of MATE1 with OCT2 likely contributes to the vectorial renal elimination of organic cationic drugs and that altered activity of MATE1, whether by drugs or polymorphisms, should be considered as an important determinant of renal cationic drug elimination.
OBJECTIVES: One of the most well-known oral medications for the treatment of T2DM is metformin. Variants have been found in studies to be useful in detecting new genes connected to T2DM aetiology and affecting metformin's mechanism of action. In this research, we aimed to study two variations of the SLC47A1 gene; rs2250486 and rs67238751, in T2DM patients who had been taking metformin for the first 6 months after the diagnosis in the Iranian population for the first time. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 200 individuals were recruited for the study. According to their glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, the patients were divided into two groups: responders (HbA1c levels were reduced by at least 1% after 6 months of metformin treatment.) and non-responders. DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyped by Tetra ARMS PCR. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure HbA1c levels at the start of the treatment and again 6 months later. RESULTS: rs2250486 variant in the dominant model reduces the HbA1C levels after 6 months of metformin treatment. In fact, when compared to the T/C + C/C genotypes, the T/T genotype improves HbA1C levels (p-value = .014). Furthermore, in the allelic model, the T allele improves HbA1C levels in comparison to the C allele (p-value = .008). After 6 months of metformin treatment, serum levels of HbA1C in responders were reduced significantly in both groups (T/T and T/C + C/C), (p-value = <.0001). However, the rs67238751 variant did not reveal a meaningful relationship with lower HbA1C levels in any of the models. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the rs2250486 variant could be associated with reducing HbA1C levels while the rs67238751 variant, had no relationship.
BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to cisplatin (CDDP) nephrotoxicity is known to vary between individuals, but the basis of this variation has not been fully elucidated. In the kidney, CDDP is taken up into the renal proximal tubular cells mainly via SLC22A2 organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and secreted into lumen via other transporters including SLC47A1 multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1). Here, we explore the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 808G>T in OCT2 and at rs2289669 G>A in MATE1 on CDDP-induced adverse events. METHODS: Fifty-three patients who had been treated with CDDP were enrolled. The plasma concentration of CDDP was measured on days 4 and 7 after treatment. The grade of hematology and nephrotoxicity was evaluated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS: In the first treatment cycle, serum creatinine (SCr) levels in the patients with OCT2 808GG and 808GT were increased by 1.43- and 1.19-fold, respectively. In the total treatment cycles, 12 patients (27 %) with 808GG experienced over grade 2 SCr elevation, whereas those with 808GT did not show any apparent nephrotoxicity. The hematological toxicity and plasma concentrations of CDDP showed no difference between patients in both groups. The rs2289669 G>A SNP in MATE1 was not associated with adverse effects and disposition of CDDP. CONCLUSION: The 808G>T SNP in OCT2 ameliorated CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity without alteration of disposition, whereas the rs2289669 G>A SNP in MATE1 had no effect on CDDP toxicity.
AIM: To elucidate the effects of rs2289669, an intron variant of the SLC47A1 gene, on glucose response to metformin in Chinese people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Rs2289669 was genotyped, using Sequenom, in 291 participants receiving 48 weeks of metformin monotherapy. The changes in HbA(1c) were compared among rs2289669 genotypes, and associations with rs2289669 were evaluated using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: We found that, compared with participants with a homozygous G allele, those carrying the minor A allele had significantly greater HbA(1c) reduction and greater increases in basal glucagon-like peptide-1 concentration. Regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between rs2289669 and the glucose response to metformin after adjusting for confounding factors, except for changes in basal glucagon-like peptide-1, for which an association was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that rs2289669 might help predict the glycaemic response to metformin in Chinese people newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and that differential increases in basal glucagon-like peptide-1 concentration among rs2289669 genotypes might be associated with inter-individual response to metformin.
