5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 5A; This is one of the several different receptors for 5- hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a biogenic hormone that functions as a neurotransmitter, a hormone, and a mitogen. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins; Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
The 5-HT1A receptor (HTR1A) and the 5-HT5A receptor (HTR5A) are key 5-HT receptors with distinct inhibitory functions. Studies have been conducted to investigate the association of a few HTR1A polymorphisms with schizophrenia, producing conflicting results, and the relationship between HTR5A and schizophrenia has not yet been well investigated. We aimed to examine the association of HTR1A and HTR5A with schizophrenia and executive function. The study included a discovery stage with 1,115 patients and 2,289 controls and a replication stage with 2,128 patients and 3,865 controls. A total of 30 common SNPs in HTR1A and HTR5A were genotyped in the discovery stage, and significantly associated SNPs were genotyped in the replication stage. We identified that two SNPs (rs878567 in HTR1A and rs1800883 in HTR5A) were significantly associated with schizophrenia in both datasets, and similar results were observed in imputation and haplotype association analyses. Moreover, we found that SNP rs1800883 significantly interacted with executive function when processing the perseverative error of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in patients. Our results provide further supportive evidence of the effect of HTR1A and HTR5A on the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that the selected genetic variations in HTR5A may be involved in impaired executive function.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genetic variations in serotonin-related genes may be associated with antidepressant treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD). The tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) gene and serotonin 5A receptor (HTR5A) gene are known to be involved in serotonin biosynthesis and signal transduction, respectively. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible interaction between the TPH1 gene and the HTR5A gene in the treatment outcome of escitalopram in MDD. METHODS: In total, 245 patients diagnosed with MDD were recruited, and their symptoms were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD-17). The association between the TPH1 218A/C and HTR5A 12A/T polymorphisms and the clinical outcomes (remission, response and changes in HAMD-17 score) was investigated after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of escitalopram treatment using multiple logistic regression or multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: No significant associations of TPH1 or HTR5A gene polymorphisms were observed with either response rate or remission rate at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after escitalopram treatment. In addition, the gene-gene interaction between TPH1 and HTR5A genes was not associated with the treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TPH1 218A/C and HTR5A 12A/T polymorphisms cannot predict treatment response in major depression.
BACKGROUND: Bipolar affective disorder (BAD) is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of mania and depression. Although the etiology is not clear, epidemiological studies suggest it is a result of an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Despite of enormous efforts and abundant studies conducted, none has yet been identified definitively a gene susceptible to bipolar disorder. METHODS: Ninety-four Bulgarian patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 184 Bulgarian healthy individuals, were used for genotyping of 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by TaqMan and/or Invader assays. Seventeen SNPs that revealed P value less than 0.05 in the first screening were genotyped using an additional independent set of samples, consisting of 78 BAD cases and 372 controls. RESULTS: After applying the Bonferonni correction on genotyping results of 172 cases and 556 controls, only one SNP, rs1800883, in the HTR5A gene revealed a significant level of P value (P=0.000097; odds ratio=1.80 (95%CI, 1.27-2.54); corrected P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HTR5A gene could play an important role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder in our population. However these findings should be viewed with caution and replication studies in other populations are necessary in support of these findings.
