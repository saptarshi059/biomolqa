PURPOSE: Genetic factor is a risk factor in glioma occurrence. This study was designed to detect the effect of ADCY9 polymorphisms on glioma risk and prognosis. METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 1080 participants (584 cases and 496 controls) to assess the relationship of ADCY9 polymorphisms with the risk and prognosis of glioma among the Chinses Han population. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to evaluate the relationship between ADCY9 variants and glioma risk. The correlation of SNPs with survival was analyzed by the Cox regression model. RESULTS: Our study showed that rs2230742 and rs2531992 polymorphisms played protective roles in glioma susceptibility (OR 0.65, p = 0.001; OR 0.73, p = 0.038, respectively). While rs2230742 significantly increased the susceptibility of III-V grade glioma patients (OR 1.50, p = 0.036). Haplotype analysis revealed that C(rs879620)A(rs2230742)A(rs2230741) haplotype was related to a significantly decreased glioma risk (OR 0.65, p = 0.002). Notably, rs2531995 and rs879620 polymorphisms significantly enhanced death risk in high-grade glioma patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.36, p = 0.041; HR 1.37, p = 0.042; respectively). For rs2230742 and rs2531992 SNPs, glioma patients had a worse prognosis (HR 2.30, p = 0.021; HR 2.30, p = 0.021; respectively). We further observed that age, chemotherapy, and surgical scope can affect the glioma prognosis. CONCLUSION: We firstly studied the association of ADCY9 variants with glioma risk and prognosis, which might give scientific evidence for exploring the molecular mechanism of glioma.
Pharmacogenomic studies have revealed associations between rs1967309 in the adenylyl cyclase type 9 (ADCY9) gene and clinical responses to the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modulator dalcetrapib, however, the mechanism behind this interaction is still unknown. Here, we characterized selective signals at the locus associated with the pharmacogenomic response in human populations and we show that rs1967309 region exhibits signatures of positive selection in several human populations. Furthermore, we identified a variant in CETP, rs158477, which is in long-range linkage disequilibrium with rs1967309 in the Peruvian population. The signal is mainly seen in males, a sex-specific result that is replicated in the LIMAA cohort of over 3400 Peruvians. Analyses of RNA-seq data further suggest an epistatic interaction on CETP expression levels between the two SNPs in multiple tissues, which also differs between males and females. We also detected interaction effects of the two SNPs with sex on cardiovascular phenotypes in the UK Biobank, in line with the sex-specific genotype associations found in Peruvians at these loci. We propose that ADCY9 and CETP coevolved during recent human evolution due to sex-specific selection, which points toward a biological link between dalcetrapib's pharmacogene ADCY9 and its therapeutic target CETP.
BACKGROUND: Recently, ADCY9 has been found to be highly expressed in colon cancer, and high ADCY9 expressionis a poor prognostic factor of colon cancer. However, no study has reported on the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADCY9 and colorectal cancer risk in the Chinese Han population. METHODS: To evaluate the association between four ADCY9 SNPs and colorectal cancer risk, we performed a case-control study including 511 colorectal cancer patients and 511 healthy controls. SNPs were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY platform (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). The distributions of alleles and genotypes frequencies between the case and control groups were compared using chi-squared. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression adjusted for age and gender to assess the association between SNPs and colorectal cancer risk. RESULTS: The overall analysis found that rs2230742 was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (AA versus GG: OR = 3.54, 95% CI = 1.16-10.86, p = 0.027; recessive model: OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 1.16-10.85, p = 0.027). Stratification analysis showed that rs2230742 was associated with an increased rectal cancer risk; rs11076810 was associated with a reduced colorectal cancer risk for age > 59 years. No association was observed between other two SNPs and colorectal cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ADCY9 polymorphisms (rs2230742 and rs11076810) have an effect on colorectal cancer risk in the Chinese Han population. Future association and functional studies are required to confirm our findings and explore the mechanism of ADCY2 in colorectal cancer.
Asthma is a respiratory disease caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The adenylyl cyclase type 9 (ADCY9) enzyme produces the cyclic-adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP), important mediator involved in bronchodilation and immunomodulatory response. The aim of this study was to investigate if rs2601796 and rs2532019 variants in the ADCY9 gene are associated with asthma and lung function. The study comprised 1,052 subjects. Logistic regressions were done using PLINK 1.9 adjusted by sex, age, BMI, smoke and principal components. Bronchodilator responsiveness was assessed using the percentage of difference in FEV1 before and after the bronchodilator use. The in silico analysis for gene expression was performed in the GTEx Portal. The variant rs2601796 (AA/AG genotype) was positively associated with asthma severity (OR: 1.60 IC95%: 1.08-2.39) and with obstruction in individuals with severe asthma (OR: 3.10, IC95%: 1.11-8.62). Individuals with severe asthma and the AA/AG genotype of rs2601796 had less responsiveness to bronchodilators and also a lower expression of ADCY9 in lung and whole blood. The variant rs2532019 (TT/GT genotype) also downregulated the ADCY9 gene expression, but no significant association with the studied phenotypes was found. Thus, the variant in ADCY9 was associated with worse asthma outcomes, including a lower response to bronchodilators, likely due to the impact on its gene expression rate. This variant may be useful in the future to assist in personalized management of patients with asthma.
Atherosclerosis has been effectively avoided with many therapies that lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, significant cardiovascular burden remains. The effect of raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been confounded by other factors (such as lowering triglycerides or LDL) and unsuccessful when attempting to solely increase HDL. Reviewing the available data, the failures of previous strategies may reflect the complexity of HDL in human metabolism and the heterogeneity of human genetics. dal-GenE (NCT02525939) represents the first large cardiovascular outcomes study to use a selective genomic test to identify the target population most likely to receive therapeutic benefit and uses a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor, dalcetrapib. Both the cholesterol ester transfer protein target and the ADCY9 polymorphism identified by the diagnostic test are based on inheritance and an evolving understanding of inborn risk. Selective treatment of subpopulations may be the key to the conundrum of HDL as an actionable risk factor.
WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Inhaled combination therapy composing of long-acting beta2-agonist and corticosteroid has been widely applied in the management of asthma, but observed treatment responses vary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacogenetic effect of the adenylyl cyclase type 9 (ADCY9) gene polymorphism on combination therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six mild to moderate Korean asthmatics were enrolled in this clinical trial. After the 2-week 'run-in' period, patients received budesonide (an inhaled corticosteroid) and formoterol (long-acting beta2-agonist) during the following 12-week active treatment period. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1) ) and maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) levels were measured at all visits as primary outcome. ADCY9 (Ile772Met, 150127 C/T, 150130 C/T, 150397 C/T, 150479 C/T, TTTA (5/4) ) and beta2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2, Arg16Gly) gene polymorphisms were genotyped. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between the ADCY9 single nucleotide polymorphisms and percent changes in FEV(1) (Ile772Met T/C, P = 0.030) and MMEF (150397 C/T, P = 0.016) after 8 weeks of combination therapy. Haplotype associations were also observed with respect to percent changes in FEV(1) after 8 weeks of therapy (Ht3[TTCC], P = 0.017). Additive therapeutic effect was observed in those with the ADCY9 Ile772Met and ADRB2 Arg16Gly gene polymorphisms in terms of percent change in FEV(1) after 8 and 12 weeks of therapy (P = 0.002 and P = 0.027 respectively). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ADCY9 gene polymorphisms may alone, and in combination with ADRB2 gene polymorphisms, contribute to individual response to combination therapy in mild to moderate asthmatics.
IMPORTANCE: A pharmacogenetic analysis of dalcetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, reported an association between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ADCY9 gene (rs1967309) and reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events despite a neutral result for the overall trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the association between the SNP in the ADCY9 gene and a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events could be replicated for another cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, evacetrapib, in patients with high-risk vascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nested case-control study examining the rs1967309 SNP in 1427 cases and 1532 matched controls selected from the 12 092-patient Assessment of Clinical Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibition with Evacetrapib in Patients at a High Risk for Vascular Outcomes (ACCELERATE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial conducted in patients with high-risk vascular disease randomized from October 2012 through December 2013. The genotyping was conducted from January 2017 to March 2017, and the data analyses were conducted from July 2017 to November 2017. EXPOSURES: Evacetrapib, 130 mg, or matching placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary analyses used a conditional logistic regression model to assess the odds ratio (OR) for major adverse cardiovascular events for evacetrapib compared with placebo for each genotype. The basic model included adjustment for age, sex, and the top 5 principal components. An additional model included cardiovascular risk factors to adjust for potential bias in selecting control patients. The primary major adverse cardiovascular event end point was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina. RESULTS: For patients with the AA genotype reported to demonstrate a beneficial effect from dalcetrapib, the OR for evacetrapib compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.69-1.12). For patients with the AG genotype, the OR was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.90-1.21). For patients with the GG genotype reported to show evidence for a harmful effect from dalcetrapib, the OR for evacetrapib was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.98-1.41). The interaction P value among the 3 genotypes was P = .17 and the trend P value was P = .06. When adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, the OR for evacetrapib was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.73-1.19) for the AA genotype, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91-1.22) for the AG genotype, and 1.02 (95% CI 0.85-1.24) for the GG genotype; interaction P = .71 and trend P = .59. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenetic analysis did not show a significant association between the ADCY9 SNP (rs1967309) and cardiovascular benefit or harm for the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor evacetrapib.
Chromosome 16p13 has been shown to display modest linkage signals for mood disorders in a number of studies. An interesting candidate gene in this region is the adenylate cyclase (AC) type 9 gene (ADCY9). ACs are critical in neuronal signaling, and perturbation of brain AC activity has been reported in mood disorder postmortem brains. ACs may also act as targets of antidepressants. Two distinct length transcripts for the ADCY9 gene have been reported, but molecular mechanisms are unknown. To investigate the potential role of ADCY9 in mood disorders, we clarified alternative poly(A) sites for the two mRNA species, delineated the exon-intron structure, and screened the gene for genetic variants. The two transcripts encoded by ADCY9 shared the first 10 exons, but exon 11 was shorter in one of the mRNA species. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms, including a missense mutation and one polymorphic microsatellite repeat in the 3'-UTR, were identified. However, a case-control study using the missense polymorphism, 2316A>G (Ile772Met), and the tetranucleotide repeat (TTTA)n showed no significant association with mood disorders in Japanese samples. The DNA polymorphisms detected in this study can be tested in other ethnic samples and/or other psychiatric diseases.
