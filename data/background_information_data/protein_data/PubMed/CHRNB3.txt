Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-3; After binding acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane.
In the U.S.A., cocaine is the second most abused illicit drug. Variants within the CHRNB3-A6 gene cluster have been associated with cigarette consumption in several GWAS. These receptors represent intriguing candidates for the study of cocaine dependence because nicotinic receptors are thought to be involved in generalized addiction pathways. Using genotypic data from a GWAS of the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) dataset, we tested for association of CHRNB3-A6 SNPs with DSM-5 cocaine use disorder. Multiple SNPs in the region were significantly associated with increased risk of cocaine use disorder. Inclusion of the most significant SNP as a covariate in a linear regression model provided evidence for an additional independent signal within this locus for cocaine use disorder. These results suggest that the CHRNB3-A6 locus contains multiple variants affecting risk for vulnerability to cocaine and nicotine dependence as well as bipolar disorder, suggesting that they have pleiotropic effects.
AIMS: Nicotine dependence is a highly heritable disorder associated with severe medical morbidity and mortality. Recent meta-analyses have found novel genetic loci associated with cigarettes per day (CPD), a proxy for nicotine dependence. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of phenotype definition (i.e., CPD versus Fagerstrom test for cigarette dependence (FTCD) score as a measure of nicotine dependence) on genome-wide association studies of nicotine dependence. DESIGN: Genome-wide association study. SETTING: Community sample. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3365 subjects who had smoked at least one cigarette were selected from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE). Of the participants, 2267 were European Americans, 999 were African Americans. MEASUREMENTS: Nicotine dependence defined by FTCD score >/=4, CPD. FINDINGS: The genetic locus most strongly associated with nicotine dependence was rs1451240 on chromosome 8 in the region of CHRNB3 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, P = 2.4 x 10(-8) ]. This association was further strengthened in a meta-analysis with a previously published data set (combined P = 6.7 x 10(-16) , total n = 4200). When CPD was used as an alternate phenotype, the association no longer reached genome-wide significance (beta  =  -0.08, P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Daily cigarette consumption and the Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence show different associations with polymorphisms in genetic loci.
Common SNPs in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes (CHRN genes) have been associated with drug behaviors and personality traits, but the influence of rare genetic variants is not well characterized. The goal of this project was to identify novel rare variants in CHRN genes in the Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence (CADD) and Genetics of Antisocial Drug Dependence (GADD) samples and to determine if low frequency variants are associated with antisocial drug dependence. Two samples of 114 and 200 individuals were selected using a case/control design including the tails of the phenotypic distribution of antisocial drug dependence. The capture, sequencing, and analysis of all variants in 16 CHRN genes (CHRNA1-7, 9, 10, CHRNB1-4, CHRND, CHRNG, CHRNE) were performed independently for each subject in each sample. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference sequence using BWA prior to variant calling with the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK). Low frequency variants (minor allele frequency < 0.05) were analyzed using SKAT-O and C-alpha to examine the distribution of rare variants among cases and controls. In our larger sample, the region containing the CHRNA6/CHRNB3 gene cluster was significantly associated with disease status using both SKAT-O and C-alpha (unadjusted p values <0.05). More low frequency variants in the CHRNA6/CHRNB3 gene region were observed in cases compared to controls. These data support a role for genetic variants in CHRN genes and antisocial drug behaviors.
Previous findings have demonstrated that variants in nicotinic receptor genes are associated with nicotine, alcohol and cocaine dependence. Because of the substantial comorbidity, it has often been unclear whether a variant is associated with multiple substances or whether the association is actually with a single substance. To investigate the possible contribution of rare variants to the development of substance dependencies other than nicotine dependence, specifically alcohol and cocaine dependence, we undertook pooled sequencing of the coding regions and flanking sequence of CHRNA5, CHRNA3, CHRNB4, CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 in 287 African American and 1028 European American individuals from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). All members of families for whom any individual was sequenced (2504 African Americans and 7318 European Americans) were then genotyped for all variants identified by sequencing. For each gene, we then tested for association using FamSKAT. For European Americans, we find increased DSM-IV cocaine dependence symptoms (FamSKAT P = 2 x 10(-4)) and increased DSM-IV alcohol dependence symptoms (FamSKAT P = 5 x 10(-4)) among carriers of missense variants in CHRNB3. Additionally, one variant (rs149775276; H329Y) shows association with both cocaine dependence symptoms (P = 7.4 x 10(-5), beta = 2.04) and alcohol dependence symptoms (P = 2.6 x 10(-4), beta = 2.04). For African Americans, we find decreased cocaine dependence symptoms among carriers of missense variants in CHRNA3 (FamSKAT P = 0.005). Replication in an independent sample supports the role of rare variants in CHRNB3 and alcohol dependence (P = 0.006). These are the first results to implicate rare variants in CHRNB3 or CHRNA3 in risk for alcohol dependence or cocaine dependence.
The CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 genes have been associated with nicotine dependence and early subjective response to nicotine. Here we present evidence, using a nationally representative sample of adults, that this region is also associated with alcohol behaviors. Six SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) spanning the CHRNB3/A6 genes were analyzed using the statistical genetics software FBAT-PC, which allows one to examine a collection of multiple phenotypes to generate a maximally heritable composite phenotype for each SNP. The six SNPs were tested using FBAT-PC including four alcohol phenotypes: average number of drinks, blackouts, total number of DSM-IV abuse and dependence symptoms endorsed, and quit attempts. Three SNPs in CHRNA6 (rs1072003, P = 0.015; rs892413, P = 0.0033 and rs2304297, P = 0.012) and one SNP in CHRNB3 (rs13280604, P = 0.0053) were associated with a composite of the alcohol phenotypes. The association was primarily driven by the average number of drinks.
Cigarette smoking is protective in Parkinson's disease (PD), possibly because of nicotine action on brain nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors. The beta3 nicotinic-acetylcholine receptor subunit (encoded by CHRNB3) is depleted in the striatum of PD patients and associated with nicotine dependence. Herein, the CHRNB3 gene was sequenced, and the c.-57G allele frequency was 0.31 and 0.26 among patients (n = 596) and controls (n = 369), respectively (p = 0.02, odds ratio = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.73). The c.-57G allele was strongly associated with smoking in patients, as 48.4% of c.-57G carriers compared with 32.6% of noncarriers reported smoking history (p < 0.0001). The transcription factor Oct-1 binding was almost eliminated in lymphoblasts with the c.-57G/G genotype, to only 6.5% percent, and the CHRNB3 promoter activity was reduced in cells with the c.-57G/G genotype by 96%-70%. These findings suggest that the CHRNB3 c.-57A>G alteration affects the promoter activity and is associated with PD and smoking in PD patients. It is therefore possible that nicotine may be valuable for patients who carry this alteration and beneficial in PD only for patients with specific genotypes.
Although numerous studies have revealed significant associations between variants in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) subunits and nicotine dependence (ND), only few studies were performed in Chinese subjects. Here, we performed association and interaction analysis for 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNB3-CHRNA6 gene cluster with ND in a Chinese Han population (N = 5,055). We found nominally significant associations for all tested SNPs with ND measured by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score; of these, 11 SNPs remained significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple tests (p = 9 x 10(-4)~2 x 10(-3)). Further conditional analysis indicated that no other SNP was significantly associated with ND independent of the most-highly significant SNP, rs6474414. Also, our haplotype-based association analysis indicated that each haplotype block was significantly associated with ND (p < 0.01). Further, we provide the first evidence of the genetic interaction of these two genes in affecting ND in this sample with an empirical p-value of 0.0015. Finally, our meta-analysis of samples with Asian and European origins for five SNPs in CHRNB3 showed significant associations with ND, with p-values ranging from 6.86 x 10(-14) for rs13280604 to 6.50 x 10(-8) for rs4950(.) This represents the first study showing that CHRNB3/A6 are highly associated with ND in a large Chinese Han sample.
BACKGROUND: Many factors associated with causing psoriasis have been reported, such as the genetic and environmental factors. Smoking is one of the well-established environmental risk factors for psoriasis and also associated with the disease severity. In addition, several studies of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have documented gene-environment interactions involving smoking behavior. Although gene polymorphisms on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits CHRNB3-CHRNA6 region gene have been found to correlate with smoking behavior and lung cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han population, the combined effect between the smoking-related genetic variants and smoking behavior on psoriasis vulgaris (PV) has been unreported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the combined effect of the smoking-related (rs6474412-C/T) polymorphism on CHRNB3-CHRNA6 region gene and smoking behavior on PV risk and clinic traits in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study including 672 subjects (355 PV cases and 317 controls) was conducted. The variant of rs6474412 was typed by SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems Co., USA). RESULTS: The higher body mass index (BMI>/=25), smoking behavior and alcohol consumption were risk factors for PV, and the estimated ORs were 1.55 (95% CI, 1.09-2.29), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.22-2.49) and 1.81 (95% CI, 1.25-2.62) respectively. The smoking patients had more severe conditions than non-smokers (OR=1.71, 95% CI, 1.08-2.70, P=0.020). The alleles and genotypes of rs6474412 were not associated with risk of PV, but the combined effect of rs6474412 genotype (TT) and smoking behavior increased severity of PV (OR=5.95; 95% CI, 1.39-25.31; P<0.05; adjusted OR=2.20; 95% CI, 1.55-3.14; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the combined effect of rs6474412-C/T polymorphism in smoking-related CHRNB3-CHRNA6 region gene and smoking behavior may not confer risk to PV, but may have impact on PV severity in Chinese Han population.
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are important regulators of smoking behavior and tobacco carcinogenesis. We studied the association of the CHRNB3-A6 variant rs13280604 in relation to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Chinese populations. Two independent case-control studies were conducted. The first case-control study, consisted of 866 ESCC patients and 1621 healthy controls from Northern China, and the second case-control study consisted of 853 ESCC patients and 860 unrelated controls from Southern China. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the associations of rs13280604 with cancer risk. We found that Rs13280604 GG/AG genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk for ESCC in both case-control studies from Northern [odds ratio (OR), 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.70, P = 1.1x10(-4)], Southern China (OR, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.26-1.93, P = 5.2x10(-5)), and the combined population of both studies (OR, 1.44, 95% CI, 1.26-1.65, P = 8.7x10(-8)), respectively. Our results suggest that this CHRNB3-A6 variant confers susceptibility to ESCC risk. However, future larger studies are needed to validate our finding.
AIMS: Studies have shown association between common variants in the alpha6-beta3 nicotinic receptor subunit gene cluster and nicotine dependence in European ancestry populations. We investigate whether this generalizes to African Americans, whether the association is specific to nicotine dependence and whether this region contains additional genetic contributors to nicotine dependence. DESIGN: We examined consistency of association across studies and race between the alpha6beta3 nicotinic receptor subunit locus and nicotine, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine dependence in three independent studies. SETTING: United States of America. PARTICIPANTS: European Americans and African Americans from three case-control studies of substance dependence. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were evaluated using the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism. Nicotine dependence was determined using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence. FINDINGS: The single nucleotide polymorphism rs13273442 was associated significantly with nicotine dependence across all three studies in both ancestry groups [odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, P = 5.8 x 10(-4) European Americans; OR = 0.80, P = 0.05 African Americans]. No other substance dependence was associated consistently with this variant in either group. Another SNP in the region, rs4952, remains modestly associated with nicotine dependence in the combined data after conditioning on rs13273442. CONCLUSIONS: The common variant rs13273442 in the CHRNB3-CHNRA6 region is associated significantly with nicotine dependence in European Americans and African Americans across studies recruited for nicotine, alcohol and cocaine dependence. Although these data are modestly powered for other substances, our results provide no evidence that correlates of rs13273442 represent a general substance dependence liability. Additional variants probably account for some of the association of this region to nicotine dependence.
Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are activated by both endogenous acetylcholine and exogenous nicotine, making sequence variations in these receptors likely candidates for association with tobacco phenotypes. Previous studies have found evidence for significant association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomic region containing the CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 genes and tobacco behaviors. In this study, we provide support for an association between these genes and tobacco dependence in the National Youth Survey Family Study wave 10, a nationally representative sample of households. Eight SNPs in the CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 genomic region were genotyped in 1051 subjects, approximately half of whom are members of sibling pairs. Genetic association with DSM-IV dependence was assessed using a family-based approach as implemented in the statistical package PBAT. Individual SNPs were tested for association with quit attempts and overall dependence. Variation in CHRNA6 was found to be associated with tobacco dependence (p=0.007 in Caucasians). SNPs in CHRNB3 were found to be associated with the number of quit attempts (p=0.0024). Together these results further implicate the region downstream of CHRNA6 and the region upstream of CHRNB3 in risk of nicotine dependence.
Smoking is a common risk factor for many diseases. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses for the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) in smokers (n = 31,266) and smoking initiation (n = 46,481) using samples from the ENGAGE Consortium. In a second stage, we tested selected SNPs with in silico replication in the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) and Glaxo Smith Kline (Ox-GSK) consortia cohorts (n = 45,691 smokers) and assessed some of those in a third sample of European ancestry (n = 9,040). Variants in three genomic regions associated with CPD (P < 5 x 10(-8)), including previously identified SNPs at 15q25 represented by rs1051730[A] (effect size = 0.80 CPD, P = 2.4 x 10(-69)), and SNPs at 19q13 and 8p11, represented by rs4105144[C] (effect size = 0.39 CPD, P = 2.2 x 10(-12)) and rs6474412-T (effect size = 0.29 CPD, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)), respectively. Among the genes at the two newly associated loci are genes encoding nicotine-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2A6 and CYP2B6) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNB3 and CHRNA6), all of which have been highlighted in previous studies of smoking and nicotine dependence. Nominal associations with lung cancer were observed at both 8p11 (rs6474412[T], odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, P = 0.04) and 19q13 (rs4105144[C], OR = 1.12, P = 0.0006).
Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been implicated in various measures of nicotine dependence. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes with tobacco and alcohol phenotypes, including frequency of use and three subjective response factors occurring shortly after initiation of use. Subjects were 1056 ethnically diverse adolescents ascertained from clinical and community settings. The most significant associations were found between two CHRNB3 SNPs (rs4950 and rs13280604) and the three subjective response factors to initial tobacco use. These findings were replicated in a separate community sample of 1524 families participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Both CHRNB3 SNPs were found to be associated with similar measures of subjective response to tobacco. These results indicate that early subjective response to nicotine may be a valuable endophenotype for genetic studies aimed at uncovering genes contributing to nicotine use and addiction.
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a key role in carcinogenesis and progression of lung cancer; and polymorphisms in CHRNA5-A3 and CHRNB3-A6, two gene clusters encoding nAChR subunits, have been associated with lung cancer risk. In this study, we investigated whether variants in the two gene clusters were associated with prognosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 165 stage IIIB-IV NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study. Three polymorphisms (rs667282 and rs3743073 in CHRNA5-A3 and rs13280604 in CHRNB3-A6) were genotyped using the TaqMan method. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the log-rank test and the Cox models. Our results showed that patients with CHRNA5-A3 rs667282 TT or TC genotypes had a significantly shorter OS than those carrying the CC genotype (Log-rank, P = 0.043). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that rs667282 TT/TC genotypes are significantly associated with increased risk of overall deaths (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7). However, the similar results were not observed for other two polymorphisms. Furthermore, no evident association was found between these variants and clinicopathologic features of advanced NSCLC. Our present study suggested that rs667282 in CHRNA5-A3 may modify the prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC.
