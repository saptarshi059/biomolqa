Thymidylate synthase; Contributes to the de novo mitochondrial thymidylate biosynthesis pathway.
TS is critical for providing the requisite nucleotide precursors in order to maintain DNA synthesis and repair. Furthermore, it is an important target for several drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate. However, several mechanisms of resistance to TS inhibitors have been explained as linked to TYMS overexpression. Some authors have described the relationship between genetic polymorphisms on TYMS, in particular rs34743033, rs2853542 and rs34489327, with the development of several diseases and with the clinical response to drug therapy and/or survival. Nevertheless, the obtained results described in the literature are controversial, which has lead to a search strategy to understand the impact of these polymorphisms on molecular epidemiology and pharmacogenetics. With the progress of these scientific areas, early identification of individuals at risk of disease along with improvement in the prediction of patients' outcome will offer a powerful tool for the translation of TYMS polymorphisms into clinical practice and individualization of treatments.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 2R/3R and 6 bp I/D polymorphisms can predict the response to or toxicity of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies on the association between the TYMS 2R/3R and 6 bp I/D polymorphisms and non-responsiveness to or toxicity of MTX in RA patients. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies involving 1613 patients were considered. Meta-analysis showed no association between the TYMS 2R/3R 3R allele and non-responsiveness to MTX therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.087, confidence interval [CI] = 0.682-1.731, p = 0.726). The meta-analysis indicated that there was no association between the TYMS 6 bp I/D D allele and non-responsiveness to MTX therapy (OR = 0.688, 95% CI = 0.281-1.683, p = 0.413). Meta-analysis revealed that the TYMS 2R/3R polymorphism was not associated with MTX toxicity, except for in a co-dominant model, and the TYMS 6 bp I/D polymorphism was not associated with MTX toxicity in all genetic models. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the TYMS 2R/3R and 6 bp I/D polymorphisms may not be associated with non-responsiveness to or toxicity of MTX therapy in RA patients.
BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. A number of dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to CRC progression and treatment response and are thought to be promising prognostic biomarkers for this cancer. microRNA-330 (miR-330-5p) has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation through suppressing thymidylate synthase (TYMS). In the current study, miR-330-5p, TYMS, and their interactions were investigated to evaluate their therapeutic and diagnostic value for CRC treatment. METHODS: The expression levels of miR-330-5p and TYMS were evaluated in silico using TCGA datasets for CRC. Data validation was performed on a set of internal samples (100 pairs of CRC tumor specimens and adjacent non-cancerous samples) utilizing real-time PCR assay. The linkage between clinicopathological parameters and expression levels was also investigated. RESULTS: TCGA results indicated that miR-330-5p and TYMS were significantly upregulated and downregulated in the CRC, respectively. Real-time PCR results confirmed that the expression of miR-330-5p was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues relative to marginal tissues (P = 0.0005), whereas TYMS expression was significantly downregulated (P = 0.0001). The transcript level of miR-330-5p was associated with tumor stage and lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION: The microRNA-330 inhibited cell proliferation by suppressing thymidylate synthase (TYMS) in colorectal cancer. Therefore, suggesting that they are valuable factors for further studies of alternative treatment and diagnostic methods.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an essential component of systemic chemotherapy for CRC. Our objective was to determine the genotypic frequency of polymorphisms affecting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) genes and to correlate the genetic profile with the toxicity due to 5-FU, also considering nongenetic factors. This is a prospective study that involved 66 patients. We extracted DNA by salting out methods. We carried out the genotyping of the different polymorphisms by simple PCR for the TYMS 5'UTR and by PCR-RFLP for DPYD: 1905 + 1 G > A, 85 T > C, 496 A > G, 1679 T > G, c.483 + 18G > A and the TYMS: 5'UTR VNTR, 5'UTR G > C and 3'UTR. The study of the association of DPYD and TYMS polymorphisms with the various signs of toxicity under 5-FU revealed that the polymorphisms 496 A > G were significantly associated with hepatotoxicity: OR = 3.85 (p = 0.04). In addition, 85 T > C was significantly associated with mucositis and neurotoxicity: OR = 4.35 (p = 0.03), OR = 3.79 (p = 0.02). For TYMS, the only significant association we observed for 5'UTR with vomiting: OR = 3.34 (p = 0.04). The incidence of adverse reactions related to 5-FU appears to be influenced in patients with CRC by the identified DPYD and TYMS gene polymorphisms in the Tunisian population.
Aims: To investigate whether variants of MTHFR, TYMS and SLCO1B1 are associated with ALT elevation in rheumatoid arthritis patients starting methotrexate (MTX). Patients & methods: Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the start of MTX treatment. Genotyping of MTHFR, TYMS and SLCO1B1 was performed. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: 34 out of 369 patients experienced ALT >1.5 x ULN less than 6 months from start. MTHFR A1298C (rs1801131) was nominally associated with an ALT >1.5 x ULN within 6 months after the start of MTX (OR = 1.7 [95% CI: 1.04-2.9]; p = 0.03), but did not pass correction for multiple testing. A multiple model containing MTHFR 1298C and clinical factors predicted the outcome (C-statistic 0.735). TYMS and SLCO1B1 were not associated with the outcome. Conclusions: A model containing MTHFR 1298C and clinical factors might predict risk of early ALT elevation.
Aim: To investigate the association of DPYD, MTHFR and TYMS polymorphisms on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) related toxicities and patient survival. Materials & methods: A total of 103 colorectal cancer patients prescribed 5-FU were included in the study. Genotyping was conducted for several DPYD, MTHFR and TYMS polymorphisms using a microarray analyzer. Results: DPYD 496A>G polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with 5-FU related grade 0-2, but not severe toxicities (p = 0.02). Furthermore, patients with DPYD 85TC and CC genotypes had longer progression and overall survival times compared to TT genotypes in our study group (log rank = 6.60; p = 0.01 and log rank = 4.40; p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusion: According to our results, DPYD 496AG and GG genotypes might be protective against severe adverse events compared to the AA genotype. Another DPYD polymorphism, 85T>C, may be useful in colorectal cancer prognosis. Further studies for both polymorphisms should be conducted in larger populations to achieve accurate results.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant tumors worldwide. DNA replication plays a critical role in the occurrence and development of pancreatic cancer. TYMS encodes thymidylate synthase, which is important for DNA synthesis. The TYMS gene has been assessed in some tumors. However, the specific role of TYMS in pancreatic cancer has not been identified. This study was designed to clarify the diagnostic and prognostic significance of TYMS in pancreatic cancer.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to compare TYMS expression in pancreatic cancer, and ROC curve analysis was used to investigate its diagnostic value. The correlation between clinical characteristics and TYMS expression was analyzed, and the prognostic value of TYMS expression in the patients with pancreatic cancer was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analysis.TYMS was upregulated in pancreatic cancer and associated with poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that TYMS is an independent risk factor for OS and RFS in patients with pancreatic cancer.The upregulation of TYMS in pancreatic cancer leads to unfavorable OS and RFS in patients, and represents a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for patients with pancreatic cancer.
BACKGROUND: Although congenital heart defects (CHDs) are a common and serious group of birth defects, relatively little is known about the causes of these conditions, and there are no established prevention strategies. There is, however, evidence suggesting that the risk of CHDs in general, and conotruncal and related defects (CTRDs) in particular, may be associated with maternal folate status and genetic variants of folate-related genes. Although several folate-related genes have been studied as they relate to CHDs and CTRDs (e.g., MTHFR), others have not been adequately assessed. METHODS: Case-parent triads were examined using log-linear analyses to assess the associations between CTRDs and both the genotype inherited by the case and the maternal genotype for the following variants: NAT1 1095C>A, NOS3 894G>T, and TYMS 1494del6. Subgroup analyses were also conducted among cases with classic conotruncal defects and cases with normally related great arteries. RESULTS: The results provided little evidence that CTRD risk was associated with the genotype inherited by the case for any of the analyzed variants. However, our results suggest that CTRD risk may be associated with the maternal genotype for NOS3 894G>T (p = 0.024 in the subgroup with normally related great arteries) and TYMS 1494del6 (p = 0.048 in the subgroup with classic conotruncal defects). However, these results were not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that CTRD risk may be related to variation within folate-pathway genes and suggests that these associations are, at least in part, mediated through the maternal genotype.
Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) is an essential enzyme for the de novo synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) and has been a primary target for cancer chemotherapy. Although the physical structure of TYMS and the molecular mechanisms of TYMS catalyzing the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to dTMP have been the subject of thorough studies, its oligomeric structure remains unclear. Here, we show that human TYMS not only exists in dimer form but also as an octamer by intermolecular Cys43-disulfide formation. We optimized the expression conditions of recombinant human TYMS using the Escherichia coli system. Using high-performance liquid chromatography(-)tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC(-)MS/MS), we have shown that purified TYMS has catalytic activity for producing dTMP. In the absence of reductant &beta;-mercaptoethanol, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that the size of the TYMS protein is about 35 kDa, 70 kDa, and 280 kDa. When the Cys43 was mutated to Gly, the band of ~280 kDa and the peak of the octamer disappeared. Therefore, TYMS was determined to form an octamer, depending on the presence of Cys43-disulfide. By measuring steady-state parameters for the monomer, dimer, and octamer, we found the k(cat) of the octamer was increased slightly more than the monomer. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the octamer in the active state might have a potential influence on the design of new drug targets.
To assess the proposed associations of the c.742-227G>A (rs2612091) polymorphism within the Enolase Superfamily Member 1 gene (ENOSF1) and two variants in the adjacent Thymidylate Synthase gene (TYMS): the 5'VNTR 28bp-repeat (rs45445694) and 3'UTR 6bp-indel (rs11280056) with severe toxicity in fluoropyrimidine-treated cancer patients, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis. Only studies investigating all three-abovementioned variants with fluoropyrimidine-related toxicities were considered for meta-analysis. Associations were tested individually for each study using multivariate regression. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. One-stage multivariate regressions including tests for independent SNP effects were applied to investigate individual effects of the variants. Multivariate haplotype regression analyses were performed on a pooled dataset to test multi-SNP effects. Of four studies including 2'067 patients, 1'912 were eligible for meta-analysis. All variants were exclusively associated with severe hand-foot-syndrome (HFS) (TYMS 2R: OR = 1.50, p = 0.0002; TYMS 6bp-ins: OR = 1.42 p = 0.0036; ENOSF1 c.742-227G: OR = 1.64 p < 0.0001, per allele). We observed independent effects for ENOSF1 c.742-227G>A and the TYMS 28bp-repeat: each toxicity-associated allele increased the risk for severe HFS (OR = 1.32 per allele, p < 0.0001). Patients homozygous for both variants were at the 3-fold higher risk for severe HFS compared to wild-type patients. Our results confirm an essential role for ENOSF1 c.742-227G and TYMS 2R-alleles in the development of fluoropyrimidine-related HFS. This suggests an important function of these genes in the development of severe HFS. Furthermore, these variants might help stratify patients in studies investigating measures of HFS prevention.
PURPOSE: The distribution of TSER (TYMS), C677T (MTHFR), Arg72Pro (p53) and C3435T (MDR1) gene polymorphisms was investigated in 80 consecutive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Observed allelic frequencies were: TSER, (2) 0.55 and (3) 0.45; MTHFR C677T, (C) 0.65 and (T) 0.35; p53 Arg72Pro, (Arg) 0.76 and (Pro) 0.24; MDR1 C3435T, (C) 0.51 and (T) 0.49. MTHFR C677T was found to be a strong predictor of the presence of multifocal tumour (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-15.7; P=0.035). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that breast cancer patients with the C/C variant may present multifocal tumour most frequently.
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a malignancy of epithelial origin in the large bowel. The elucidation of the biological functions of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) biomarkers including their roles in the pathophysiology of CRC - has led to their applications in diagnostic and chemo-pharmaceutics. We investigated whether PD-L1, TYMS, and DCC protein expression in CRC tumors are predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome for CRC patients. The expressions of PD-L1, TYMS, and DCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 91 paraffin-embedded samples from patients who underwent colectomy procedure in Hospital Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia. There was high expression of DCC in most cases: 84.6% (77/91). PD-L1 showed low expression in 93.4% (86/91) of cases and high expression in 6.6% (5/91) of cases. Low and high expressions of TYMS were detected in 53.8% (49/91) and 46.2% (42/91) of the CRC cases, respectively. There was a significant association between the TYMS expression and gender (P < 0.05); the expression of TYMS was observed at a high level in 76.2% of males and in 23.8% of females. The mean overall survival (OS) was 100 months for the CRC patients evaluated. The OS for patients with high expression of PD-L1 was 22 months. Patients with high expression of TYMS and DCC showed OS of 90 and 96 months, respectively. The results from this study suggest that PD-L1, TYMS, and DCC expression could be used as biomarkers to stratify CRC patients who could benefit from adjuvant therapy.
Aim:TYMS gene encodes for TS enzyme involved in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine (CAP) metabolism. This study assessed the association of TYMS-TSER and 3RG>C polymorphisms with 5-FU/CAP adverse event (AE) incidence. Materials & methods:TYMS-TSER and 3RG>C polymorphisms were analyzed by use of PCR/PCR-RFLP in 313 5-FU/CAP-treated cancer patients. Results: Female TYMS-TSER 2R carriers were at increased risk for 5-FU/CAP AEs (odds ratio: 2.195; p = 0.032). 2R/2R genotype was the only factor that increased risk for delayed drug administration or therapy discontinuation (odds ratio: 5.049; p = 0.016). No other associations were found. Conclusion:TYMS-TSER 3R/2R polymorphism was associated with incidence of AEs in female cancer patients. This gender-driven association potentially implicates the ER that, in female patients, potentially regulates TS expression.
AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether the relative mRNA expressions of the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and the excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) genes are associated with in vitro chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 67 patients with pathologic TNM stage II, III, and IV. TYMS and ERCC1 mRNA expression was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The chemosensitivity was examined using an ATP-based chemotherapy response assay. A high response was defined as a response producing >/=40% reduction in ATP. RESULTS: The mean level of TYMS mRNA expression in the groups with low and high response to 5-FU was 2.35x10(-3) +/- 2.16x10(-3) 2(-(DeltaCt)) and 4.54x10(-3) +/- 2.46x10(-3) 2(-(DeltaCt)), respectively. The mean level of ERCC1 mRNA expression in the groups with low and high response to oxaliplatin was 13.92x10(-3) +/- 9.90x10(-3) 2(-(DeltaCt)) and 23.59x10(-3) +/- 5.88x10(-3) 2(-(DeltaCt)), respectively. Groups with high response to 5-FU and oxaliplatin had significantly higher expression of TYMS and ERCC1 mRNA, respectively (p<0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: High expression of TYMS and ERCC1 mRNA was associated with better in vitro chemosensitivity to 5-FU and oxaliplatin, respectively, in patients with colorectal cancer.
AIM: To investigate the impact of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), KRAS and BRAF in the survival of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: Clinical data were collected retrospectively from records of consecutive patients with mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy from 1/2005 to 1/2007. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were retrieved for analysis. TYMS genotypes were identified with restriction fragment analysis PCR, while KRAS and BRAF mutation status was evaluated using real-time PCR assays. TYMS gene polymorphisms of each of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and 5'UTR were classified into three groups according to the probability they have for high, medium and low TYMS expression (and similar levels of risk) based on evidence from previous studies. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed. RESULTS: The analysis recovered 89 patients with mCRC (46.1% de novo metastatic disease and 53.9% relapsed). Of these, 46 patients (51.7%) had colon cancer and 43 (48.3%) rectal cancer as primary. All patients were treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (5FU or capecitabine) as single-agent or in combination with irinotecan or/and oxaliplatin or/and bevacizumab. With a median follow-up time of 14.8 mo (range 0-119.8), 85 patients (95.5%) experienced disease progression, and 63 deaths (70.8%) were recorded. The 3-year and 5-year OS rate was 25.4% and 7.7% while the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 7.1%. Multivariate analysis of TYMS polymorphisms, KRAS and BRAF with clinicopathological parameters indicated that TYMS 3'UTR polymorphisms are associated with risk for disease progression and death (P < 0.05 and P < 0.03 respectively). When compared to tumors without any del allele (genotypes ins/ins and ins/loss of heterozygosity (LOH) linked with high TYMS expression) tumors with del/del genotype (low expression group) and tumors with ins/del or del/LOH (intermediate expression group) have lower risk for disease progression (HR = 0.432, 95%CI: 0.198-0.946, P < 0.04 and HR = 0.513, 95%CI: 0.287-0.919, P < 0.03 respectively) and death (HR = 0.366, 95%CI: 0.162-0.827, P < 0.02 and HR = 0.559, 95%CI: 0.309-1.113, P < 0.06 respectively). Additionally, KRAS mutation was associated independently with the risk of disease progression (HR = 1.600, 95%CI: 1.011-2.531, P < 0.05). The addition of irinotecan in 1(st) line chemotherapy was associated independently with lower risk for disease progression and death (HR = 0.600, 95%CI: 0.372-0.969, P < 0.04 and HR = 0.352, 95%CI: 0.164-0.757, P < 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION: The TYMS genotypes ins/ins and ins/LOH associate with worst prognosis in mCRC patients under fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Large prospective studies are needed for validation of our findings.
