Histamine H2 receptor; The H2 subclass of histamine receptors mediates gastric acid secretion. Also appears to regulate gastrointestinal motility and intestinal secretion. Possible role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase and, through a separate G protein-dependent mechanism, the phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC) signaling pathway (By similarity); Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
Although the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) has been evolutionarily conserved, the role of this protein remains elusive. Recent evidence indicates that PrP(C) may be involved in neuroinflammation and the immune response in the brain, and its expression may be modified via various mechanisms. Histamine is a proinflammatory mediator and neurotransmitter that stimulates numerous cells via interactions with histamine receptors 1-4 (HRH1-4). Since microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, we hypothesized that histamine-induced stimulation regulates the expression of PrP(C) in human-derived microglia. The human microglial clone 3 (HMC3) cell line was treated with histamine, and intracellular calcium levels were measured via a calcium flux assay. Cytokine production was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to determine protein and gene expression of HRH1-4. Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to measure PrP(C) expression levels. Fluorescence microscopy was used to examine Iba-1 and PrP(C) localization. HMC3 cells stimulated by histamine exhibited increased intracellular calcium levels and increased release of IL-6 and IL-8, while also modifying PrP(C) localization. HMC3 stimulated with histamine for 6 and 24 hours exhibited increased surface PrP(C) expression. Specifically, we found that stimulation of the HRH2 receptor was responsible for changes in surface PrP(C). Histamine-induced increases in surface PrP(C) were attenuated following inhibition of the HRH2 receptor via the HRH2 antagonist ranitidine. These changes were unique to HRH2 activation, as stimulation of HRH1, HRH3, or HRH4 did not alter surface PrP(C). Prolonged stimulation of HMC3 decreased PrP(C) expression following 48 and 72 hours of histamine stimulation. HMC3 cells can be stimulated by histamine to undergo intracellular calcium influx. Surface expression levels of PrP(C) on HMC3 cells are altered by histamine exposure, primarily mediated by HRH2. While histamine exposure also increases release of IL-6 and IL-8 in these cells, this cytokine release is not fully dependent on PrP(C) levels, as IL-6 release is only partially reduced and IL-8 release is unchanged under the conditions of HRH2 blockade that prevent PrP(C) changes. Overall, this suggests that PrP(C) may play a role in modulating microglial responses.
The pathophysiological functions of cardiac histamine level and related histamine receptors during the development of chronic heart failure (CHF) were intensively investigated previously. However, the relevance of polymorphisms in histamine-related genes, such as HRH2, HRH3, DAO, and HNMT, with CHF remains largely neglected. This study herein aims to analyze the clinical associations of polymorphisms in those genes with CHF risk. A total of 333 unrelated Chinese Han CHF patients and 354 ethnicity-matched healthy controls were recruited and 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. We found that the HRH3 rs3787429 polymorphism was associated with CHF risk (p < 0.001). The T allele of rs3787429 exhibited protective effect against CHF under the dominant (ORs = 0.455; 95% CIs = 0.322-0.642) and additive models (ORs = 0.662; 95% CIs = 0.523-0.838), while, for SNPs in HRH2, DAO, and HNMT, no significant associations were observed in the present study. These findings for the first time screen out one SNP (rs3787429) of HRH3 gene that was significantly associated with CHF in Chinese Han population, which may be a novel biomarker for personal prevention and treatment of CHF and provides novel highlights for investigating the contribution of this disease.
AIM: Histamine plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Genetic variations in histamine receptors (HRH) may influence the expression of allergic diseases. This study analyzes the association between HRH variants and NSAID hypersensitivity reactions. PATIENTS & METHODS: The authors analyzed copy number variations (CNVs) and common functional SNPs in genes HRH1, HRH2 and HRH4 in 442 unrelated patients with hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and in 414 healthy unrelated controls. RESULTS: The authors identified, both in patients and control subjects, individuals carrying CNVs in HRH genes. The most common genotype corresponded to two copies of each gene, but carriers of one or three copies of HRH1 (5% of individuals), HRH2 (1.1%) and HRH4 genes (0.9%) were also identified. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we describe CNVs in human HRH genes. Neither common functional SNPs in HRH genes nor CNVs influenced the risk of developing hypersensitivity to NSAIDs.
Histamine plays important physiological roles in the upper gastrointestinal tract and acts via the H2 receptor. The -1018 G>A (rs2067474) in an enhancer element of the promoter and non-synonymous rs79385261 (Asn46Thr) were identified in HRH2. We attempted to clarify the associations of these polymorphisms with gastric carcinogenesis. The study was performed in 321 patients with gastric cancer and 599 subjects with no evidence of gastric malignancies on upper gastroduodenal endoscopy. The genotypes were determined using a one-tube multiplex PCR-SSCP method. The degree of gastritis was assessed in 496 subjects and serum pepsinogen (PG) I/II levels were measured in 124 subjects without gastric cancer. The minor allele of Asn46Thr could not be detected. The frequencies of the -1018 A allele in the non-GC and GC groups were 13.5% and 8.26%, respectively (p=0.00077). Overall, -1018 GG homozygotes had an increased risk for developing gastric cancer (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.17-2.42; p=0.0052), especially intestinal type cancer (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.23-3.08; p=0.0047). In subjects aged >60 years, the adjusted risk for gastric cancer among individuals who were -1018 GG homozygotes was 1.87 (range 1.19-2.93; p=0.0065) compared with A carriers. In the gastric cancer cases located in the antrum and at comparative advanced stage, -1018 GG homozygosity was a significantly increased risk factor. In subjects >60 years, the metaplasia score was significantly higher in -1018 GG homozygotes than A carriers. Both atrophy and metaplasia scores were significantly increased with age only in -1018 GG homozygotes. The PG I/II ratio was significantly decreased in H. pylori positive GG homozygotes than negative GG homozygotes and positive A carriers. Our results suggest that -1018 GG homozygosity of HRH2 may be associated with the severity of gastric mucosal atrophy. This genotype has an increased risk for the subsequent development of gastric cancer, especially intestinal type, at advanced age.
BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation patterns in CpG island are known to be influential in gene silencing. Histamine plays important physiological roles in the upper gastrointestinal tract and acts via the H2 receptor. We report an investigation into the effect of HRH2 promoter polymorphism (rs2607474 G > A) on the methylation of DAPK and CDH1. METHODS: Non cancerous gastric mucosa samples were obtained from 115 subjects with gastric cancer (GC) and 412 non-cancer subjects (non-GC). Methylation status of genes was determined by MSP. The genotyping of rs2607474 was performed by PCR-SSCP. RESULTS: Methylation of DAPK and CDH1 was observed in 296 and 246 subjects, respectively. The frequency of CDH1 methylation in the subjects with GC was significantly lower in cancer lesion than in non cancerous mucosa, whereas that of DAPK methylation was not different. The allelic distribution of rs2607474 was 401GG, 119GA and 7AA. The GG homozygote was associated with a significantly increased risk for methylation of both DAPK and CDH1 (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0009, respectively). In the non-GC subjects or more than 60 years of age, GG homozygote was more closely associated with both DAPK and CDH1 methylation. However, this genotype did not show an increased risk for the development of methylation of both genes in patients with GC. In H. pylori negative subjects, GG homozygote showed an increased risk for the methylation of both DAPK and CDH1 (p = 0.0074 and p = 0.0016, respectively), whereas this genotype was associated with an increased risk for the development of DAPK methylation in H. pylori positive subjects (p = 0.0018). In addition, in subjects older than 60 years of age, atrophy and metaplasia scores were significantly higher in the GG homozygote (p = 0.011 and p = 0.039, respectively) and a significant correlation was observed between age and atrophy or metaplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rs2607474 GG homozygote confers a significantly increased risk for age- and inflammation-related DAPK and CDH1 methylation.
BACKGROUND AND AIM: Histamine plays important physiological roles in upper gastrointestinal tract and acts via the H2 receptor. A polymorphism -1018 G>A (rs2067474) was identified in an enhancer element of the HRH2 promoter. We attempted to clarify the associations of this polymorphism with the progression of gastric mucosal atrophy. METHODS: Gastric mucosa samples were obtained from 398 subjects with no malignancies. The rs2067474 genotype was determined by PCR-SSCP method. The degree of gastritis was assessed in 366 subjects and serum pepsinogen (PG) I/II levels were measured in 108 subjects. The subjects with atrophy score higher or equal to 2 and metaplasia score higher or equal to1 were classified into the severe atrophic gastritis group (SA group). RESULTS: The -1018G>A minor allele frequencies in SA and non-SA groups were 8.02% and 13.3%, respectively (p=0.057). The -1018 GG homozygote had a significantly high risk for gastric mucosal atrophy (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.03-4.01, p=0.042). In H. pylori positive subjects, GG homozygote was a more significant risk factor for gastric mucosal atrophy (OR: 2.32, 95%CI: 1.12-4.81, p=0.023). In addition, in the subjects older than 60 years, GG homozygote had also a significant risk for gastric mucosal atrophy (OR: 2.63, 95%CI: 1.15-6.00, p=0.022). In -1018 GG homozygote, PG I/II ratio was significantly lower in H. pylori positive than negative subjects and was significantly decreased with age (p=0.0032 by ANOVA), whereas it was not in the A carrier. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HRH2 -1018 GG homozygote is a risk factor for the severity of gastric mucosal atrophy under the influence of H. pylori infection, especially in older subjects.
