Retinoic acid receptor RXR-gamma; Receptor for retinoic acid. Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes. The RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5. The high affinity ligand for RXRs is 9-cis retinoic acid (By similarity).
BACKGROUND: Retinoid X Receptor Gamma (RXRG) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays a role in tumour suppression. This study aims to explore the prognostic significance of RXRG in breast cancer. METHODS: Primary breast cancer tissue microarrays (n = 923) were immuno-stained for RXRG protein and correlated with clinicopathological features, and patient outcome. RESULTS: Nuclear RXRG expression was significantly associated with smaller tumour size (p = 0.036), lower grade (p < 0.001), lobular histology (p = 0.016), lower Nottingham Prognostic Index (p = 0.04) and longer breast cancer-specific survival (p < 0.001), and longer time to distant metastasis (p = 0.002). RXRG expression showed positive association with oestrogen receptor (ER)-related biomarkers: GATA3, FOXA1, STAT3 and MED7 (all p < 0.001) and a negative correlation with the Ki67 proliferation marker. Multivariate analysis demonstrated RXRG protein as an independent predictor of longer breast cancer-specific survival and distant metastasis-free survival. In the external validation cohorts, RXRG expression was associated with improved patients' outcome (p = 0.025). In ER-positive tumours, high expression of RXRG was associated with better patient outcome regardless of adjuvant systemic therapy. ER signalling pathway was the top predicted master regulator of RXRG protein expression (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the prognostic value of RXRG in breast cancer particularly the ER-positive tumours.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of RXRG rs1467664, rs3753898 and the genetic susceptibility of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese Han population from South China. METHODS: In our case-control study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1467664 and rs3753898 were genotyped by SNPscanTM kit in 1092 patients with T2D as cases and 1092 normal persons as controls. The distributions of genotype and allele frequencies in two groups were analyzed by the SPSS 20.0 software. RESULTS: The distribution of genotypes and alleles of RXRG rs3753898 was statistically significant between the two groups, but there was no significant difference in the distribution of genotypes and alleles of the rs1467664. Before and after the adjustment of age, sex and BMI, rs3753898 in the two groups had statistical significance under the additive, dominant and recessive models (P<0.05), but no statistical differences were found under the overdominance and co-dominant genetic models (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the genetic models of rs1467664 between the two groups (P>0.05). The haplotype, which consists of rs1467664 allele T and rs3753898 allele A was a high-risk factor for T2D, OR=1.27, 95% CI (1.09-1.47), Padj=0.002. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the single nucleotide polymorphism of RXRG rs3753898 may be related to genetic susceptibility of type 2 diabetes. The haplotype consisting of the allele T of rs1467664 and the allele A of rs3753898 is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the genetic variation of RXRG gene may be the genetic cause of diabetes mellitus in the Chinese Han population.
Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) is a rare genetic disorder. In a subset of FIPA families AIP germline mutations have been reported, but in most FIPA cases the exact genetic defect remains unknown. The present study aimed to determine the genetic basis of FIPA in a Brazilian family. Three siblings presented with isolated prolactin genes. Further mutation screening was performed using whole-exome sequencing and all likely causative mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. In silico analysis and secreting pituitary adenoma diagnosed through clinical, biochemical and imaging testing. Sanger sequencing was used to genotype candidate prolactinoma-mutated additional predictive algorithms were applied to prioritize likely pathogenic variants. No mutations in the coding and flanking intronic regions in the MEN1, AIP and PRLR genes were detected. Whole-exome sequencing of three affected siblings revealed novel, predicted damaging, heterozygous variants in three different genes: RXRG, REXO4 and TH. In conclusion, the RXRG and TH possibly pathogenic variants may be associated with isolated prolactinoma in the studied family. The possible contribution of these genes to additional FIPA families should be explored.
