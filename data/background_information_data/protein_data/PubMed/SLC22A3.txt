A new study reveals an involvement of SLC22A3 in the development of familial oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Reduced expression of SLC22A3 is detected not only in ESCC tumours but also in non-tumour tissues of patients with familial ESCC. Interestingly, adenosine-to-inosine editing of SLC22A3 mRNA is proposed to drive early tumour invasion and metastasis, by inhibiting SLC22A3 expression.
BACKGROUND: We screened out several hypermethylated solute carrier (SLC) family genes in acute myeloid leukemia by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. SLC22A3 encodes an organic cation transport protein, which is critical for drug transportation and cellular detoxification. SLC22A3 is significantly downregulated and associated with tumor progression and worse prognosis in a variety of solid tumors. However, there are no data available regarding the role of SLC22 in AML. This study aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation on SLC22A3 expression, as well as its clinical significance in AML prognosis. RESULTS: SLC22A3 was identified as the sole prognosis-associated gene among SLCs based on TCGA and Beat AML databases. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) from AML, MDS patients, and healthy donors were enrolled in this study. SLC22A3 methylation was significantly increased in AML compared with controls and MDS patients; meanwhile, the expression level of SLC22A3 was decreased. SLC22A3 hypermethylation presented an obvious association with some specific clinical characteristics and affected the survival time of AML patients as an independent risk indicator. SLC22A3 expression changed regularly as the disease complete remissions and relapses. Demethylation drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) activated transcription and increased mRNA expression of SLC22A3 in leukemia cell lines and AML fresh BMMNCs. Knockdown of SLC22A3 in leukemia cells enhanced cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis. Data from public programs were used for auxiliary screening of probable molecular mechanisms of SLC22A3 in the antileukemia effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that increased methylation and decreased expression of SLC22A3 may be indicators of poor prognosis in AML. Methylation-silenced SLC22A3 expression may have potential guiding significance on antileukemia effect of DAC.
AIMS: This study aims to investigate the influence of MEF2A and SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA polymorphisms on cardiovascular disease susceptibility and responsiveness to warfarin medication in Jordanian patients, during the initiation and maintenance phases of treatment. BACKGROUNDS: Several candidate genes have been reported to be involved in warfarin metabolism and studying such genes may help in finding an accurate way to determine the needed warfarin dose to lower the risk of adverse drug effects, resulting in more safe anticoagulant therapy. METHODS: The study population included 212 cardiovascular patients and 213 healthy controls. Genotyping of MEF2A and SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA polymorphisms was conducted to examine their effects on warfarin efficiency and cardiovascular disease susceptibility using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: One SNP (SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA rs10455872) has been associated with cardiovascular disease in the Jordanian population, whereas the other SNPs in the MEF2A gene and SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster did not have any significant differences between cardiovascular patients and healthy individuals. Moreover, SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA rs10455872 was correlated with moderate warfarin sensitivity, the other SNPs examined in the current study have not shown any significant associations with warfarin sensitivity and responsiveness. CONCLUSION: Our data refer to a lack of correlation between the MEF2A polymorphism and the efficacy of warfarin treatment in both phases of treatment, the initiation, and maintenance phases. However, only rs10455872 SNP was associated with sensitivity to warfarin during the initiation phase. Furthermore, rs3125050 has been found to be associated with the international normalized number treatment outcomes in the maintenance phase.
BACKGROUND: It has been reported that expression of OCT3 enhanced the sensitivity to melphalan in cells, indicative of potential roles of OCT3 in melphalan transport. Herein we investigated the association of select single nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC22A3 (gene encoding OCT3) with clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma (MM) patients with hematopoietic autologous stem cell transplants followed by high-dose melphalan therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Melphlan concentrations in blood samples from 108 MM patients were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MuS); genotypes of rs2048327, rs1810126, and rs3088442 in these patients were determined using quatitive RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: Rs3088442 A variant-carriers had a significantly increased risk of severe oral mucositis in comparison with homozygous rs3088442 G-carriers with adjusted odds ratio of 4.00 (95% CI=1.25-14.7; p=0.027). Rs3088442 A carriers tended to have lower creatinine clearance (p=0.10) and higher maximum plasma concentration of melphalan (p=0.07). CONCLUSION: OCT3 might be involved in melphalan transport in MM patients.
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive and fatal disease, with most patients succumbing within 1-2 years despite undergoing multiple treatments. Androgen-receptor (AR) inhibitors, including enzalutamide (ENZ), are used for the treatment of mCRPC; however, most patients develop resistance to ENZ. Herein, we propose that the repression of SLC22A3 by AR-V7/YAP1/TAZ conferred ENZ resistance in mCRPC. SLC22A3 expression is specifically downregulated in the ENZ-resistant C4-2B MDVR cells, and when YAP1/TAZ is hyperactivated by AR full-length or AR-V7, these proteins interact with DNMT1 to repress SLC22A3 expression. We observed low SLC22A3 expression and high levels of TAZ or YAP1 in mCRPC patient tissues harbouring AR-V7 and the opposite expression patterns in normal patient tissues. Our findings suggest a mechanism underlying ENZ resistance by providing evidence that the AR-V7/YAP1/TAZ axis represses SLC22A3, which could be a potential treatment target in prostate cancer.
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporters translocate diverse substances across cellular membranes and their deregulation may cause drug resistance of cancers. This study investigated significance of protein expression and cellular localization of the previously suggested putative prognostic markers ABCC2 and SLC22A3 in pancreatic cancer patients. Protein localization and brush border staining intensity of ABCC2 and SLC22A3 was assessed in tumor tissue blocks of 65 pancreatic cancer patients and associated with clinical data and survival of patients with regard to therapy. Negative SLC22A3 brush border staining in pancreatic tumors significantly increased the risk of both disease progression and patient s death in univariate analyses. Multivariate analyses confirmed the association of SLC22A3 expression with progression-free survival of patients. A subgroup analysis of patients treated with regimens based on nucleoside analogs suggested that patients with negative brush border staining or apical localization of SLC22A3 in tumor cells have worse overall survival. The combination of positive ABCC2 and negative SLC22A3 brush border staining predicted worst overall survival and patients with positive brush border staining of both proteins had best overall and progression-free survival. The present study shows for the first time that the protein presence and to some extent also localization of SLC22A3 significantly associate with prognosis of pancreatic cancer in both unstratified and chemotherapy-treated patients. The combination of ABCC2 and SLC22A3 brush border staining also needs further attention in this regard.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several clinical and genetic factors have been shown to modulate the cardiovascular risk in subjects affected by familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in the general population have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This include the rs2048327 variant in the SLC22A3 gene. However, the effect of this SNP in FH subjects is unknown. The objectives of this study are to investigate the association between rs2048327 and the prevalence of CVD as well as with the concentration of lipoprotein (a) (Lp (a)), in a cohort of genetically-confirmed heterozygous FH patients. METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunoassay kit was used to assess the Lp (a) concentration, whereas an exome chip genotyping method was used to impute the rs2048327 genotype. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 287 non-carriers (TT), 305 heterozygous carriers (TC) and 76 homozygous carriers of the rs2048327 variant. In a model corrected for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, rs2048327 was significantly associated with Lp (a) level (median value of 12, 16 and 29 mg/dL in TT, TC and CC carriers, respectively, p < .0001). In a model corrected for cardiovascular risk factors and Lp(a) value, carrying the C allele was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of CVD (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.21-3.19, p = .007). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that the rs2048327 SNP of the SLC22A3 gene was significantly associated with Lp(a) as well as with CVD events in FH subjects. Further studies are required in order to investigate the mechanisms behind these associations.
BACKGROUND: Amphiphilic solute facilitator organic cation transporters mediate the movement of various endogenous and exogenous organic cations, including crucial drugs like metformin, oxaliplatin, and lamivudine. These transporters are now seen as a potential explanation for inter-individual differences in drug effectiveness, contributing to 15-30% of such variability due to genetic factors.The aim of this study was to determine the baseline minor allele frequency distribution of 18 known coding SNPs in the SLC22A3 gene of 278 Cape Admixed (130) and Xhosa (148) individuals residing in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: A convenience sampling method was used for sample collection. DNA extraction and subsequent amplification of target sites was carried out according to standard established methodologies. All genotyping was performed using the SNaPshot mini-seuqencing platform. RESULTS: This study found no genetic polymorphisms in the coding region of the SLC22A3 gene of both the Xhosa and Cape Admixed individuals investigated. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that SLC22A3 coding SNPs observed in other populations are absent in the sample of both Cape Admixed and Xhosa individuals studied. The lack of protein sequence variation was consistent with other studies and may reflect the significant physiological role of human organic cation transporter 3 in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.
Previous studies showed that PHACTR1 and SLC22A3 are involved in coronary vascular development and are key determinants of cardiovascular disease risk. We conducted a case-control study to examine the effect of SLC22A3 and PHACTR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on CAD risk among 376 male CAD patients and 388 male healthy controls from China. Eleven SLC22A3 and PHACTR1 SNPs were selected and genotyped using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY technology. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age. The rs9381439 minor allele "A" (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.54-0.96; p = 0.024) in an allelic model was associated with reduced CAD risk, as were the rs2048327 "C/C" (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.37-0.97; p = 0.036) and rs1810126 "T/T" (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36-0.93; p = 0.024) genotypes. Likewise, the rs9349379 "A/G" genotype in a dominant model (p = 0.041), the rs1810126 "T/C" genotype in additive (p = 0.041) and recessive (p = 0.012) models, and the rs2048327 "C/T" genotype in a recessive model were associated with decreased CAD risk (p = 0.016). These results suggest several PHACTR1 and SLC22A3 polymorphisms are associated with decreased CAD risk in the male Chinese Han population.
OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified that genetic variants in the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster influence plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration. However, the association between this gene cluster and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), especially the potential underlying mechanism, remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between variation in the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster and CAD. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed 2-stage case-control studies in a Chinese Han population. The variant genotypes were examined for their association with both Lp(a) level and severity of CAD. Putative mechanisms were also evaluated. One single nucleotide polymorphism, rs3088442, in the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster was significantly associated with both plasma Lp(a) levels and CAD severity. The gene dosage of the risk allele at rs3088442 indicated a robust association with left main trunk disease (P=0.046), number of vascular lesions (P=4.5x10(-3)), and Gensini scores (P=0.012) in patients with CAD. Reporter gene analysis indicated that the rs3088442 G allele might suppress miR-147a binding to the 3' untranslated region of SLC22A3, resulting in altered SLC22A3 and LPA gene expression (P=0.015 and 9.2x10(-6), respectively), possibly explaining the increased plasma Lp(a) levels and risk of CAD. CONCLUSIONS: The genotype of rs3088442 within the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster may contribute to regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels and possibly to the severity of CAD in a Chinese Han population.
BACKGROUND: Human organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3,SLC22A3) mediates the uptake of many important endogenous substances and basic drugs, and has been identified as one of the transporters that are highly expressed in human skin. However, the mechanisms responsible for variability in mRNA expression, and the role of SLC22A3 in human skin is not clear. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms ofSLC22A3 on the variability in SLC22A3 expression and sebum levels in humans. METHODS: Immunostaining of OCT3 in human skin was performed. We analyzed the association of promoter variants with the SLC22A3 mRNA expression levels in human skins. Luciferase, knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay were employed to investigate transcriptional regulation of SLC22A3 expression. Effects of the identified variant on sebum levels were evaluated in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed marked expressions of OCT3 in the basal epidermis, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and sweat glands of human skin. SLC22A3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in skin samples with homozygotes for -1603A/A than in those for -1603 G/G. The analysis of p53 binding to -1603 G > A in the promoter ofSLC22A3 suggested that -1603 G > A down-regulates SLC22A3 gene expression by decreased p53 binding in the vicinity of the -1603 site. In humans, squalene levels in samples from the back at the baseline were significantly lower in homozygotes for -1603A/A than in those for -1603 G/G. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the genetic variant contributes to the variability of expression and activities of OCT3 in human skin.
Previous a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of colorectal cancer in Japanese population has identified a risk region at the chromosome 6q26-q27 associated with colorectal cancer risk. However, the causal gene at this locus remained unclear. In our study, we enrolled a total of 14 candidate functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 6q26-q27 (318 kb), and then genotyped them by TaqMan method in a Chinese population including 1,147 colorectal cancer cases and 1,203 controls. Among that, 5 SNPs were identified statistical association with colorectal cancer risk by logistic regression analysis. Of which, SNP rs420038 G > A in SLC22A3 was related to decreased risk of colorectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.94, p = 0.007), and also associated with lower expression of SLC22A3 (p = 0.040) using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Moreover, by the luciferase assays, we found that compared to the G allele of rs420038, the A allele could suppress the activity of the promoter in SLC22A3. Furthermore, the expression of SLC22A3 was significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues than that in paired normal tissues (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the phenotypes of proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cell were significantly affected by SLC22A3 in vitro. Our results revealed a novel susceptible locus, rs420038 in SLC22A3, which may be involved in colorectal cancer development and progression.
Expression of the solute carrier (SLC) transporter SLC22A3 gene is associated with overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. This study tested whether genetic variability in SLC22A3 associates with pancreatic cancer risk and prognosis. Twenty four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the SLC22A3 gene sequence and regulatory elements were selected for analysis. Of these, 22 were successfully evaluated in the discovery phase while six significant or suggestive variants entered the validation phase, comprising a total study number of 1,518 cases and 3,908 controls. In the discovery phase, rs2504938, rs9364554, and rs2457571 SNPs were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Moreover, rs7758229 associated with the presence of distant metastases, while rs512077 and rs2504956 correlated with overall survival of patients. Although replicated, the association for rs9364554 did not pass multiple testing corrections in the validation phase. Contrary to the discovery stage, rs2504938 associated with survival in the validation cohort, which was more pronounced in stage IV patients. In conclusion, common variation in the SLC22A3 gene is unlikely to significantly contribute to pancreatic cancer risk. The rs2504938 SNP in SLC22A3 significantly associates with an unfavorable prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Further investigation of this SNP effect on the molecular and clinical phenotype is warranted.
