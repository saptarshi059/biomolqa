In this issue of Neuron, Lopez-Rojas et al. (2022) uncover a cortical circuit conveying social information to CA2, a region essential for social memory. Their findings suggest CA2 neurons integrate information from other extrahippocampal circuits to locally compute social novelty.
Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchangers (NCKX) are plasma membrane transporters that are thought to mainly mediate Ca2+ extrusion (along with K+) at the expense of the Na+ electrochemical gradient. However, because they are bidirectional, most assays have relied on measuring their activity in the reverse (Ca2+ import) mode. Herein we describe a method to control intracellular ionic conditions, and examine the forward (Ca2+ extrusion) mode of exchange of NCKX2.
Local Ca(2+) signals through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (CaVs) drive synaptic transmission, neural plasticity, and cardiac contraction. Despite the importance of these events, the fundamental relationship between flux through a single CaV channel and the Ca(2+) signaling concentration within nanometers of its pore has resisted empirical determination, owing to limitations in the spatial resolution and specificity of fluorescence-based Ca(2+) measurements. Here, we exploited Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CaV channels as a nanometer-range Ca(2+) indicator specific to active channels. We observed an unexpected and dramatic boost in nanodomain Ca(2+) amplitude, ten-fold higher than predicted on theoretical grounds. Our results uncover a striking feature of CaV nanodomains, as diffusion-restricted environments that amplify small Ca(2+) fluxes into enormous local Ca(2+) concentrations. This Ca(2+) tuning by the physical composition of the nanodomain may represent an energy-efficient means of local amplification that maximizes information signaling capacity, while minimizing global Ca(2+) load.
Although many cell functions are regulated by Ca(2+) oscillations induced by a cyclic release of Ca(2+) from intracellular Ca(2+) stores, the pacemaker mechanism of Ca(2+) oscillations remains to be explained. Using green fluorescent protein-based Ca(2+) indicators that are targeted to intracellular Ca(2+) stores, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we found that Ca(2+) shuttles between the ER and mitochondria in phase with Ca(2+) oscillations. Following agonist stimulation, Ca(2+) release from the ER generated the first Ca(2+) oscillation and loaded mitochondria with Ca(2+). Before the second Ca(2+) oscillation, Ca(2+) release from the mitochondria by means of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger caused a gradual increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration, inducing a regenerative ER Ca(2+) release, which generated the peak of Ca(2+) oscillation and partially reloaded the mitochondria. This sequence of events was repeated until mitochondrial Ca(2+) was depleted. Thus, Ca(2+) shuttling between the ER and mitochondria may have a pacemaker role in the generation of Ca(2+) oscillations.
Coupling of excitation to secretion, contraction and transcription often relies on Ca(2+) computations within the nanodomain-a conceptual region extending tens of nanometers from the cytoplasmic mouth of Ca(2+) channels. Theory predicts that nanodomain Ca(2+) signals differ vastly from the slow submicromolar signals routinely observed in bulk cytoplasm. However, direct visualization of nanodomain Ca(2+) far exceeds optical resolution of spatially distributed Ca(2+) indicators. Here we couple an optical, genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicator (TN-XL) to the carboxy tail of Ca(V)2.2 Ca(2+) channels, enabling near-field imaging of the nanodomain. Under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we detect Ca(2+) responses indicative of large-amplitude pulses. Single-channel electrophysiology reveals a corresponding Ca(2+) influx of only 0.085 pA, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements estimate TN-XL distance to the cytoplasmic mouth at ~55 A. Altogether, these findings raise the possibility that Ca(2+) exits the channel through the analogue of molecular portals, mirroring the crystallographic images of side windows in voltage-gated K channels.
