OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and is currently a major health problem owing to difficulties in diagnosis at the early stage of the disease. Changes in DNA methylation status have now been identified as a critical component in the initiation of lung cancer, and the detection of DNA methylation is expected to be an important method for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. Nicotine, the principal tobacco alkaloid, directly contributes to lung carcinogenesis through the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the role of the CHRNB4 gene, which encodes the nAchR beta4 subunit that is ubiquitously expressed on lung epithelial cells, we analyzed its methylation status in 266 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and compared it with clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The frequency of CHRNB4 unmethylation was 13.5% and 8.3% in malignant and nonmalignant tissues, respectively. CHRNB4 demethylation was associated with upregulation of its mRNA expression and was more frequent in squamous cell carcinoma and pathological stages II-IIIA disease than in adenocarcinoma and pathological stage I disease, respectively (P=0.003 and P=0.01, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that CHRNB4 unmethylation was significantly associated with unfavorable overall survival in the entire patient group as well as in men and ever-smokers. These results suggest that epigenetic regulation of CHRNB4 may affect tumor progression and survival in patients with NSCLC. Further investigation into the molecular basis of the role of CHRNB4 in the progression of NSCLC is warranted.
BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex illness that can be attributed to the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The nicotinic receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15 has a plausible association with SUD, particularly with nicotine dependence. METHODS: This study investigated 15 SNPs within the CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 genes. Sequencing was used for genotyping 495 Jordanian males with SUD and 497 controls matched for age, gender, and descent. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that none of the tested alleles or genotypes were correlated with SUD. However, our analysis suggests that the route of substance use was linked to rs1051730 (P value = 0.04), rs8040868 (P value = 0.01) of CHRNA3, and rs16969968 (P value = 0.03) of CHRNA5. Additionally, a correlation was identified between rs3813567 of the CHRNB4 gene and the age at substance use onset (P value = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Variants in CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 may interact with SUD features that can influence the development and progression of the disorder among Jordanians.
Functionally related genes often cluster into a genome region under coordinated regulation, forming a local regulome. To understand regulation of the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 nicotinic receptor gene cluster, we integrate large-scale RNA expression data (brain and peripheral) from GTEx (Genotype Tissue Expression), clinical associations (GRASP), and linkage disequilibrium data (1000 Genomes) to find candidate SNPs representing independent regulatory variants. CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB4 mRNAs, and a well-expressed CHRNA5 antisense RNA (RP11-650L12.2) are co-expressed in many human tissues, suggesting common regulatory elements. The CHRNA5 enhancer haplotype tagged by rs880395 not only increases CHRNA5 mRNA expression in all tissues, but also enhances RP11-650L12.2 and CHRNA3 expression, suggesting DNA looping to multiple promoters. However, in nucleus accumbens and putamen, but not other brain regions, CHRNA3 expression associates uniquely with a haplotype tagged by rs1948 (located in the CHRNB4 3'UTR). Haplotype/diplotype analysis of rs880395 and rs1948 plus rs16969968 (a nonsynonymous CHRNA5 risk variant) in GWAS (COGEND, UW-TTURC, SAGE) yields a nicotine dependence risk profile only partially captured by rs16969968 alone. An example of local gene clusters, this nicotinic regulome is controlled by complex genetic variation, with broad implications for interpreting GWAS.
Common genetic factors strongly contribute to both nicotine, the main addictive component of tobacco, and alcohol use. Several lines of evidence suggest nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as common sites of action for nicotine and alcohol. Specifically, rs1948, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the CHRNB4 3'-untranslated region (UTR), has been associated to early age of initiation for both alcohol and tobacco use. To determine the allelic effects of rs1948 on gene expression, two rs1948-containing sequences of different lengths corresponding to the CHRNB4 3'-UTR were cloned into pGL3-promoter luciferase reporter vectors. Data obtained showed that the allelic effects of SNP rs1948 on luciferase expression are mediated by the length and species of transcripts generated. In addition, it was found that miR-3157 increased the overall luciferase expression while miR-138, a microRNA known to play a role in neuroadaptation to drug abuse, decreased luciferase expression when compared to basal conditions. These findings demonstrate the importance of SNP rs1948 on the regulation of CHRNB4 expression and provide the first evidence of CHRNB4 down-regulation by miR-138.
INTRODUCTION: Reducing adverse events from pharmacologic treatment is an important goal of precision medicine and identifying genetic predictors of adverse events is a step toward this goal. In 2012, King et al. reported associations between genetic variants and adverse events in a placebo-controlled smoking cessation trial of varenicline and bupropion. Strong associations were found between gastrointestinal adverse events and 11 variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region of chromosome 15, a region repeatedly associated with smoking-related phenotypes. Our goal was to replicate, in an independent sample, the impact of variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region on gastrointestinal adverse events and to extend the analyses to adherence and smoking cessation. METHODS: The University of Wisconsin Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center (TTURC) conducted a multiarmed, placebo-controlled smoking cessation trial of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy that included 985 genotyped European-ancestry participants. We evaluated relationships between our key variables using logistic regression. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal adverse events were experienced by 31.6% TTURC participants. Each of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 associations from the King et al. study was found in TTURC, with the same direction of effect. Neither these variants nor the gastrointestinal adverse events themselves were associated with adherence to medication or successful smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region of chromosome 15 are associated with gastrointestinal adverse events in smoking cessation. Additional independent variants in this region strengthen the association. The consistency between the results of these two independent studies supports the conclusion that these findings reflect biological response to the use of smoking cessation medication. IMPLICATIONS: The fact that our findings from the TTURC smoking cessation trial support the independent findings of King et al. suggest that associations of variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region of chromosome 15 with gastrointestinal adverse events while taking medications for smoking cessation reflect biology. However, although adherence to medication was a strong predictor of successful smoking cessation in TTURC, neither adverse events nor the genetic variants associated with them predicted either adherence or successful cessation in this study. Thus, although we should strive to minimize adverse events during treatment, we should not expect that to increase successful smoking cessation substantially.
Several previous genome-wide and targeted association studies revealed that variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 (CHRNA5/A3/B4) gene cluster on chromosome 15 that encode the alpha5, alpha3, and beta4 subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are associated with nicotine dependence (ND) in European Americans (EAs) or others of European origin. Considering the distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns in European and other ethnic populations such as African Americans (AAs), it would be interesting to determine whether such associations exist in other ethnic populations. We performed a comprehensive association and interaction analysis of the CHRNA5/A3/B4 cluster in two ethnic samples to investigate the role of variants in the risk for ND, which was assessed by Smoking Quantity, Heaviness Smoking Index, and Fagerstrom test for ND. Using a family-based association test, we found a nominal association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1317286 and rs8040868 in CHRNA3 with ND in the AA and combined AA and EA samples. Furthermore, we found that several haplotypes in CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 are nominally associated with ND in AA, EA, and pooled samples. However, none of these associations remained significant after correction for multiple testing. In addition, we performed interaction analysis of SNPs within the CHRNA5/A3/B4 cluster using the pedigree-based generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method and found significant interactions within CHRNA3 and among the three subunit genes in the AA and pooled samples. Together, these results indicate that variants within CHRNA3 and among CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 contribute significantly to the etiology of ND through gene-gene interactions, although the association of each subunit gene with ND is weak in both the AA and EA samples.
Genome-wide association studies have identified common variation in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 and CHRNA6-CHRNB3 gene clusters that contribute to nicotine dependence. However, the role of rare variation in risk for nicotine dependence in these nicotinic receptor genes has not been studied. We undertook pooled sequencing of the coding regions and flanking sequence of the CHRNA5, CHRNA3, CHRNB4, CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 genes in African American and European American nicotine-dependent smokers and smokers without symptoms of dependence. Carrier status of individuals harboring rare missense variants at conserved sites in each of these genes was then compared in cases and controls to test for an association with nicotine dependence. Missense variants at conserved residues in CHRNB4 are associated with lower risk for nicotine dependence in African Americans and European Americans (AA P = 0.0025, odds-ratio (OR) = 0.31, 95% confidence-interval (CI) = 0.31-0.72; EA P = 0.023, OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.50-0.95). Furthermore, these individuals were found to smoke fewer cigarettes per day than non-carriers (AA P = 6.6 x 10(-5), EA P = 0.021). Given the possibility of stochastic differences in rare allele frequencies between groups replication of this association is necessary to confirm these findings. The functional effects of the two CHRNB4 variants contributing most to this association (T375I and T91I) and a missense variant in CHRNA3 (R37H) in strong linkage disequilibrium with T91I were examined in vitro. The minor allele of each polymorphism increased cellular response to nicotine (T375I P = 0.01, T91I P = 0.02, R37H P = 0.003), but the largest effect on in vitro receptor activity was seen in the presence of both CHRNB4 T91I and CHRNA3 R37H (P = 2 x 10(-6)).
BACKGROUND: Smokers have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently linked several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4 cluster on chromosome 15.q25 to smoking behaviors and nicotine dependence. Investigations into these SNPs may help explain the nature and mechanisms of the smoking-PD relationship. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the genetic variations that were consistently associated with smoking or nicotine dependence in recent GWAS also predict the risk of PD. METHODS: This is a population-based case-control study of 788 physician-diagnosed PD patients and 911 controls, all non-Hispanic Whites. Seven SNPs were selected based on findings from recent GWAS on smoking and nicotine dependence, all from the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRN) A3-A5-B4. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were derived from logistic regression models under the assumption of logit-additive allelic effects. RESULTS: Four SNPs in linkage disequilibrium from the CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4 cluster were associated with smoking duration (OR >1.3, p < 0.05). However, none of the SNPs from this cluster was associated with PD risk in the overall analysis or after stratifying on smoking status. CONCLUSION: This preliminary analysis does not support a relationship between these smoking-related GWAS SNPs and PD.
INTRODUCTION: Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Caucasian populations have identified an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA5-A3-B4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene cluster on chromosome 15q25, lung cancer risk and smoking behaviors. However, these SNPs are rare in Asians, and there is currently no consensus on whether SNPs in CHRNA5-A3-B4 have a direct or indirect carcinogenic effect through smoking behaviors on lung cancer risk. Though some studies confirmed rs6495308 polymorphisms to be associated with smoking behaviors and lung cancer, no research was conducted in China. Using a case-control study, we decided to investigate the associations between CHRNA3 rs6495308, CHRNB4 rs11072768, smoking behaviors and lung cancer risk, as well as explore whether the two SNPs have a direct or indirect carcinogenic effect on lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 1025 males were interviewed using a structured questionnaire (204 male lung cancer patients and 821 healthy men) to acquire socio-demographic status and smoking behaviors. Venous blood samples were collected to measure rs6495308 and rs11072768 gene polymorphisms. All subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-smokers, light smokers (1-15 cigarettes per day) and heavy smokers (>15 cigarettes per day). RESULTS: Compared to wild genotype, rs6495308 and rs11072768 variant genotypes reported smoking more cigarettes per day and a higher pack-years of smoking (P<0.05). More importantly, among smokers, both rs6495308 CT/TT and rs11072768 GT/GG had a higher risk of lung cancer compared to wild genotype without adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.36, 95%CI = 1.09-1.95; OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.07-1.58 respectively). Furthermore, heavy smokers with rs6495308 or rs11072768 variant genotypes have a positive interactive effect on lung cancer after adjustment for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.01-3.09; OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.01-3.41 respectively). However, No significant associations were found between lung cancer risk and both rs6495308 and rs11072768 genotypes among non-smokers and smokers after adjusting for age, occupation, and education. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed both rs6495308 and rs11072768 gene polymorphisms association with smoking behaviors and had an indirect link between gene polymorphisms and lung cancer risk.
Genetic variations in the CYP2A6 nicotine metabolic gene and the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 (CHRNA5-A3-B4) nicotinic gene cluster have been independently associated with lung cancer. With genotype data from ever-smokers of European ancestry (417 lung cancer patients and 443 control subjects), we investigated the relative and combined associations of polymorphisms in these two genes with smoking behavior and lung cancer risk. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare smoking variables among the different genotype groups, and odds ratios (ORs) for cancer risk were estimated using logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Cigarette consumption (P < .001) and nicotine dependence (P = .036) were the highest in the combined CYP2A6 normal metabolizers and CHRNA5-A3-B4 AA (tag single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1051730 G>A) risk group. The combined risk group also exhibited the greatest lung cancer risk (OR = 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21 to 3.40), which was even higher among those who smoked 20 or fewer cigarettes per day (OR = 3.03; 95% CI = 1.38 to 6.66). Variation in CYP2A6 and CHRNA5-A3-B4 was independently and additively associated with increased cigarette consumption, nicotine dependence, and lung cancer risk. CYP2A6 and CHRNA5-A3-B4 appear to be more strongly associated with smoking behaviors and lung cancer risk, respectively.
Nicotine dependence (ND) is a worldwide health problem. Numerous genetic studies have demonstrated a significant association of variants in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with smoking behaviors. However, most of these studies enrolled only subjects of European or African ancestry. In addition, although an increasing body of evidence implies a causal connection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, few studies of this issue have been reported. In this study, we performed both association and interaction analysis for 67 SNPs in CHRNA3-A5, CHRNA7, CHRNB2, and CHRNB4 with ND in a Chinese Han population (N = 5055). We further analyzed cis-mQTL for the three most significant SNPs and 5580 potential methylation loci within these target gene regions. Our results indicated that the SNPs rs1948 and rs7178270 in CHRNB4 and rs3743075 in CHRNA3 were significantly associated with the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score (p = 6.6 x 10(-5); p = 2.0 x 10(-4), and p = 7.0 x 10(-4), respectively). Haplotype-based association analysis revealed that two major haplotypes, T-G and C-A, formed by rs3743075-rs3743074 in CHRNA3, and other two major haplotypes, A-G-C and G-C-C, formed by rs1948-rs7178270-rs17487223 in CHRNB4, were significantly associated with the FTND score (p </= 8.0 x 10(-4)). Further, we found evidence for the presence of significant interaction among variants within CHRNA3/B4/A5, CHRNA4/B2/A5, and CHRNA7 in affecting ND, with corresponding p values of 5.8 x 10(-6), 8.0 x 10(-5), and 0.012, respectively. Finally, we identified two CpG sites (CpG_2975 and CpG_3007) in CHRNA3 that are significantly associated with three cis-mQTL SNPs (rs1948, rs7178270, rs3743075) in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 cluster (p </= 1.9 x 10(-6)), which formed four significant CpG-SNP pairs in our sample. Together, we revealed at least three novel SNPs in CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 to be significantly associated with the FTND score. Further, we showed that these significant variants contribute to ND via two methylated sites, and we demonstrated significant interaction affecting ND among variants in CHRNA5/A3/B4, CHRNA7, and CHRNA4/B2/A5. In sum, these findings provide robust evidence that SNPs in nAChR genes convey a risk of ND in the Chinese Han population.
Variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster have been associated with nicotine dependence (ND) and ND-related traits. To evaluate a potential underlying mechanism for this association, we investigated the effects of 10 variants in this gene cluster and their interactive effects as a result of recent smoking on cognitive flexibility, a possible mediator of genetic effects in smokers. Cognitive flexibility of 466 European Americans (EAs; 360 current smokers) and 805 African Americans (AAs; 635 current smokers) was assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The main effects of variants and haplotypes and their interaction with recent smoking on cognitive flexibility were examined using multivariate analysis of variance and the haplotype analysis program HAPSTAT. In EAs, the major alleles of five variants (CHRNA5-rs3841324-22 bp-insertion-allele, CHRNA5-rs615470-C-allele, CHRNA3-rs6495307-C-allele, CHRNA3-rs2869546-T-allele, and CHRNB4-rs11637890-C-allele) were associated with significantly greater perseverative responses (P=0.003-0.017) and perseverative errors (P=0.004-0.026; recessive effect). Among EAs homozygous for the major alleles of each of these five variants, current smokers made fewer perseverative responses and perseverative errors than did past smokers. Significant interactive effects of four variants (rs3841324, rs615470, rs6495307, and rs2869546) and current smoking on cognitive flexibility were observed (perseverative responses (P=0.010-0.044); perseverative errors (P=0.017-0.050)). However, in AAs, 10 variants in this gene cluster showed no apparent effects on cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest that variation in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster influences cognitive flexibility differentially in AAs and EAs and that current smoking moderates this effect. These findings could account in part for differences in ND risk associated with these variants in AAs and EAs.
Genome-wide association studies have highlighted three major lung cancer susceptibility regions at 15q25.1, 5p15.33 and 6p21.33. To gain insight into the possible mechanistic relevance of the genes in these regions, we investigated the regulation of candidate susceptibility gene expression by epigenetic alterations in healthy and lung tumor tissues. For genes up or downregulated in lung tumors, the influence of genetic variants on DNA methylation was investigated and in vitro studies were performed. We analyzed 394 CpG units within 19 CpG islands in the susceptibility regions in a screening set of 34 patients. Significant findings were validated in an independent patient set (n=50) with available DNA and RNA. The most consistent overall DNA methylation difference between tumor and adjacent normal tissue on 15q25 was tumor hypomethylation in the promoter region of CHRNB4 with a median difference of 8% (P<0.001), which resulted in overexpression of the transcript in tumors (P<0.001). Confirming previous studies, we also found hypermethylation in CHRNA3 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) with significant expression changes. Decitabine treatment of H1299 cells resulted in reduced methylation levels in gene promoters, elevated transcript levels of CHRNB4 and CHRNA3, and a slight downregulation of TERT demonstrating epigenetic regulation of lung cancer cells. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs421629 on 5p15.33 and rs1948, rs660652, rs8040868 and rs2036527 on 15q25.1, previously identified as lung cancer risk or nicotine-addiction modifiers, were associated with tumor DNA methylation levels in the promoters of TERT and CHRNB4 (P<0.001), respectively, in two independent sample sets (n=82; n=150). In addition, CHRNB4 knockdown in two different cell lines (A549 and H1299) resulted in reduced proliferation (PA549<0.05;PH1299<0.001) and propensity to form colonies in H1299 cells. These results suggest epigenetic deregulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (nAChR) genes which in the case of CHRNB4 is strongly associated with genetic lung cancer susceptibility variants and a functional impact on tumorigenic potential.
Most neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are heteropentamers, composed of alpha and beta subunits. Mice lacking the alpha3 subunit and mice lacking both the beta2 and beta4 subunits, but not mice lacking the beta2 or beta4 subunits alone, have a severe phenotype characterized by megacystis, failure of bladder strips to contract in response to nicotine, widely dilated ocular pupils, growth failure, and perinatal mortality. The deficit in bladder contraction was also found in mice lacking only the beta4 subunit, although they did not develop megacystis. The major bladder phenotype resembles the human autosomal recessive disorder of megacystis-microcolon-hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS). Based on the similarity of the mouse and human phenotypes, we initiated mutation analyses in the alpha3 and beta4 genes in MMIHS families. The human gene encoding the beta4 subunit was fully characterized, including refinement of its mapping. Analysis of disease families and controls identified numerous genetic variants, including high-frequency polymorphisms in both CHRNA3 and CHRNB4. Although no loss-of-function mutations have been identified to date, these genes remain strong candidates for involvement in MMIHS, because various mutations might be obscured within the complex cluster of genes. Some of the markers presented here are valuable tools for analysis of the role of genetic variation in responses to nicotine and for characterization of various dysautonomic abnormalities.
OBJECTIVE: Smoking is highly intractable, and the genetic influences on cessation are unclear. Identifying the genetic factors affecting smoking cessation could elucidate the nature of tobacco dependence, enhance risk assessment, and support development of treatment algorithms. This study tested whether variants in the nicotinic receptor gene cluster CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 predict age at smoking cessation and relapse after an attempt to quit smoking. METHOD: In a community-based, crosssectional study (N=5,216) and a randomized comparative effectiveness smoking cessation trial (N=1,073), the authors used Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression to model the relationships of smoking cessation (self-reported quit age in the community study and point-prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment in the clinical trial) to three common haplotypes in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region defined by rs16969968 and rs680244. RESULTS: The genetic variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region that predict nicotine dependence also predicted a later age at smoking cessation in the community sample. In the smoking cessation trial, haplotype predicted abstinence at end of treatment in individuals receiving placebo but not among individuals receiving active medication. Haplotype interacted with treatment in affecting cessation success. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers with the high-risk haplotype were three times as likely to respond to pharmacologic cessation treatments as were smokers with the low-risk haplotype. The high-risk haplotype increased the risk of cessation failure, and this increased risk was ameliorated by cessation pharmacotherapy. By identifying a high-risk genetic group with heightened response to smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, this work may support the development of personalized cessation treatments.
There is strong evidence for shared genetic factors contributing to childhood externalizing disorders and substance abuse. Externalizing disorders often precede early substance experimentation, leading to the idea that individuals inherit a genetic vulnerability to generalized disinhibitory psychopathology. Genetic variation in the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 gene cluster has been associated with early substance experimentation, nicotine dependence, and other drug behaviors. This study examines whether the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 locus is correlated also with externalizing behaviors in three independent longitudinally assessed adolescent samples. We developed a common externalizing behavior phenotype from the available measures in the three samples, and tested for association with 10 SNPs in the gene cluster. Significant results were detected in two of the samples, including rs8040868, which remained significant after controlling for smoking quantity. These results expand on previous work focused mainly on drug behaviors, and support the hypothesis that variation in the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 locus is associated with early externalizing behaviors.
