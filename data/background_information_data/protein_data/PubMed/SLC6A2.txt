Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter; Amine transporter. Terminates the action of noradrenaline by its high affinity sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic terminals. Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF) (TC 2.A.22) family. SLC6A2 subfamily.
Variation in the gene encoding for the norepinephrine transporter (NET, SLC6A2) has repeatedly been linked with ADHD, although there is some inconsistency regarding the association with specific genes. The variants for which most consistent association has been found are the NET variants rs3785157 and rs28386840. Here, we tested for their association with ADHD diagnosis and ADHD-related phenotypes during development in a longitudinal German community sample. Children were followed from age 4 to age 15, using diagnostic interviews to assess ADHD. Between the ages of 8 and 15 years, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was administered to the primary caregivers. The continuous performance task (CPT) was performed at age 15. Controlling for possible confounders, we found that homozygous carriers of the major A allele of the functional promoter variant rs28386840 displayed a higher rate of ADHD lifetime diagnosis. Moreover, homozygous carriers of the minor T allele of rs3785157 were more likely to develop ADHD and showed higher scores on the CBCL externalizing behavior scales. Additionally, we found that individuals heterozygous for rs3785157 made fewer omission errors in the CPT than homozygotes. This is the first longitudinal study to report associations between specific NET variants and ADHD-related phenotypes during the course of development.
BACKGROUND: There is insufficient replicated data to establish a relationship between the polymorphisms of SLC6A2 and CYP2D6 and the treatment responses of atomoxetine (ATX) in ADHD. We focused on evaluating the effect of top-line single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A2 and CYP2D6 on the ATX treatment response in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Of 160 patient records, 34 patients who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated to determine the relationship between genotypes of ten SNPs (six of SLC6A2 and four of CYP2D6) and ATX treatment response. Additionally, the connection between SNPs of CYP2D6 and the severity of side effects associated with ATX was analyzed in 37 patients, including the 34 study patients, and three patients discontinued because of ATX-dependent side effects. RESULTS: All six polymorphisms we studied in SLC6A2 were associated with the treatment response of ATX. Clinical improvement in oppositional defiant disorder symptoms of patients with ADHD was only observed in carriers of the homozygous "C" allele of rs3785143 (p(odd) = 0.026). We detected an association between higher CGI-side-effect severity scores and the "TT" genotype of rs1065852 polymorphism in CYP2D6 (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that genotypes of polymorphisms within the SLC6A2 and CYP2D6 may play an influential role in treatment response or the severity of side effects associated with ATX in ADHD patients.
The NG_016969.1:g.5003A>G promoter polymorphism (rs168924) in the SLC6A2 norepinephrine transporter gene was found to be predictive of the hypertensive status in a Japanese population, but no data are available for Caucasians. Genotyping for rs168924 was performed in 282 young men with normal blood pressure (BP), grade 1 or 2 hypertension. In addition to casual BP, 24-hour ABPM and echocardiography were performed. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant association of rs168924 genotype with diagnosis of hypertension (P=.044), casual systolic BP (SBP) levels (P=.028), and daytime ambulatory SBP (P=.02). The finding that rs168924 was also significantly associated with diastolic posterior wall thickness (P=.041), an echocardiographic index of hypertensive cardiac target organ damage, further supports the notion that the rs168924 SNP in SLC6A2 in fact might influence BP. Unlike previous findings in a Japanese population, in our Caucasian study cohort the presence of the minor rs168924 G allele was associated with lower prevalence of hypertension.
Selective blockade of the norepinephrine transporter with reboxetine has been reported to induce a slight but significant increase in blood pressure. This study was designed to examine the relation of genetic variants of the norepinephrine transporter gene (solute carrier family 6, member 2; SLC6A2) with hypertension in a Japanese population. We genotyped five genetic variants of SLC6A2, three in the promoter region and two in the intronic sequence, in 1,950 subjects recruited from the Suita study. One of the variants, an A > G polymorphism in the promoter region (Promoter 3 polymorphism), was found to be associated with hypertension. Multiple logistic analysis indicated that sex (p = 0.0223), age (p < 0.0001), body mass index (p < 0.0001), alcohol consumption (p = 0.0002), and the Promoter 3 genotype (AA = 1, AG + GG = 2) (p = 0.0090) were predictive of hypertensive status. The odds ratio of the AG + GG genotypes for hypertension was 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.69) over the AA genotype. SLC6A2 may be one of the genes that contribute to hypertension in Japanese. To our knowledge, this is the first report to detect associations between SLC6A2 genetic variants and blood pressure.
The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates levels of monoamine neurotransmitters integral to a variety of behaviors and autonomic functions. Two SLC6A2 polymorphisms have been used in genetic association studies, generating intriguing but nondefinitive results on traits such as hypertension and mood. One of these SLC6A2 variants is functional but rare. The other is common but not informative over the entire 48 kb SLC6A2 region and is insufficient to capture the functional diversity potentially contained within any SLC6A2 region. To elucidate SLC6A2 haplotype structure and define markers sufficient to capture haplotype diversity within detected haplotype blocks, 26 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 384 individuals evenly divided across Finnish Caucasian, US Caucasian, Plains American Indian, and African American populations. Three conserved blocks, 13.6, 12.5, and 25 kb in size and showing little evidence for historical recombination were observed in all populations. Haplotype diversity in block 1 and numbers of common haplotypes were highest in African Americans, among whom 5-6 optimal markers were sufficient to maximize diversity of each block. For other populations, 2-3 markers/block sufficed, but the optimal markers differed across populations. The SLC6A2 haplotype map and 25-marker panel (excluding the monomorphic one) is a comprehensive tool for genetic linkage studies on phenotypes related to NET function.
This study was intended to ascertain whether SNPs in dopaminergic and serotoninergic pathway genes SLC6A2, SLC6A3 and DRD2 are associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese people. We conducted a case-control study by genotyping 7 SNPs of the three genes in 1034 schizophrenia patients and 1034 controls. No significant difference in the allelic or genotypic frequency was detected between cases and controls despite one positive haplotype (rs1362621-rs2242446-rs5564). Stratified analysis of gender and gene-gene interaction analysis showed no positive results. In summary, our study denies the major role of these SNPs within the three genes for schizophrenia in Han Chinese.
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: We previously found that the intronic norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) polymorphism rs36017 modulates feelings of elation after administration of 20 mg D-amphetamine in healthy volunteers. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we further investigated the association between D-amphetamine response and 11 SLC6A2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs36017, in an extended sample of Caucasian young adults. METHODS: One hundred fifty-nine healthy volunteers participated in a three-session double-blind crossover design receiving either placebo or oral D-amphetamine (10 and 20 mg). Based on our previous results, we examined the associations between levels of self-reported elation and vigor after D-amphetamine administration and SNPs and SNP haplotypes in SLC6A2. RESULTS: Consistent with our previous findings, SNPs rs36017 and rs1861647 were associated with significantly higher ratings of elation and vigor after 20 mg Damphetamine. Ratings of vigor after 20 mg D-amphetamine were also associated with a two-SNP haplotype formed with rs1861647 and rs5569 and a three-SNP haplotype formed with rs36017, rs10521329, and rs3785155. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further evidence that genetic variants in the SLC6A2 gene are involved in acute response to D-amphetamine, which may influence progression to amphetamine abuse. Identifying sources of variation in acute drug responses could lead to better prevention and treatment of psychostimulant abuse and may be valuable in the therapeutic use of stimulants.
BACKGROUND: Norepinephrine transporter (NET) is encoded by the SLC6A2 gene and is a potential target for studying the pathogenesis of PTSD. To the best of our knowledge, no prior investigations have examined SLC6A2 polymorphism-related neuroimaging abnormalities in PTSD patients. METHODS: In 218 Han Chinese adults who had lost their sole child, we investigated the association between the T-182 C SLC6A2 genotype and gray matter volume (GMV). Participants included 57 PTSD sufferers and 161 non-PTSD sufferers, and each group was further separated into three subgroups based on each participant's SLC6A2 genotype (TT, CT, and CC). All participants received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluation. To assess the effects of PTSD diagnosis, genotype, and genotype x diagnosis interaction on GMV, 2 x 3 full factorial designs were used. Pearson's correlations were used to examine the association between GMV and CAPS, HAMD, and HAMA. RESULTS: The SLC6A2 genotype showed significant main effects on GMV of the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG) and the bilateral middle cingulate gyrus (MCG). Additionally, impacts of the SLC6A2 genotype-diagnosis interaction were discovered in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG). The CAPS, HAMA, and HAMD scores, as well as the genotype main effect and diagnostic SLC6A2 interaction, did not significantly correlate with each other. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a modulatory effect that the SLC6A2 polymorphism exerts on the SPG and MCG, irrespective of PTSD diagnosis. We found evidence to suggest that the SLC6A2 genotype-diagnosis interaction on SFG may potentially contribute to PTSD pathogenesis in adults who lost their sole child.
We studied seven genes that reflect events relevant to antidepressant action at four sequential levels: (1) entry into the brain, (2) binding to monoaminergic transporters, and (3) distal effects at the transcription level, resulting in (4) changes in neurotrophin and neuropeptide receptors. Those genes are ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), the noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A3 and SLC6A4), cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase type 2 receptor (NTRK2). Sequence variability for those genes was obtained in exonic and flanking regions. A total of 56 280 000 bp across were sequenced in 536 unrelated Mexican Americans from Los Angeles (264 controls and 272 major depressive disorder (MDD)). We detected in those individuals 419 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); the nucleotide diversity was 0.00054 + or - 0.0001. Of those, a total of 204 novel SNPs were identified, corresponding to 49% of all previously reported SNPs in those genes: 72 were in untranslated regions, 19 were in coding sequences of which 7 were non-synonymous, 86 were intronic and 27 were in upstream/downstream regions. Several SNPs or haplotypes in ABCB1, SLC6A2, SLC6A3, SLC6A4, CREB1 and NTRK2 were associated with MDD, and in ABCB1, SLC6A2 and NTRK2 with antidepressant response. After controlling for age, gender and baseline 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D21) score, as well as correcting for multiple testing, the relative reduction of HAM-D21 score remained significantly associated with two NTRK2-coding SNPs (rs2289657 and rs56142442) and the haplotype CAG at rs2289658 (splice site), rs2289657 and rs2289656. Further studies in larger independent samples will be needed to confirm these associations. Our data indicate that extensive assessment of sequence variability may contribute to increase understanding of disease susceptibility and drug response. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of direct re-sequencing of key candidate genes in ethnic minority groups in order to discover novel genetic variants that cannot be simply inferred from existing databases.
Genetic variants in monoamine neurotransmitter genes have been recurrently associated with panic disorder, addiction and mood disorders. Recent evidence also indicates that norepinephrine neurotransmission can influence a series of psychophysical and psychobiological parameters related to athletic performance, and the presence of variants in the SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2) gene, which encodes the norepinephrine transporter, can be detrimental to an adequate noradrenergic signaling. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to explore the SLC6A2 Thr99Ile variant (rs1805065) in a cohort composed of highly-trained individuals and non-trained individuals. A total of 1556 Brazilians: 926 non-athletes and 630 athletes (322 endurance athletes and 308 power athletes) were compared in this case-control association study. The Thr99Ile variant showed only two genotypes (C/C or C/T), and a low minor allele frequency of  approximately 1%. However, none of the power athletes had the mutant T-allele (i.e., the C/T genotype), which may be related to decreased norepinephrine transporter activity. The genotype distribution and allele frequency observed in power athletes were significantly different when compared to non-athletes or endurance athletes. Therefore, the presence of the T-allele may decrease the chance of belonging to the group of athletes involved in explosive physical tasks. These results still need to be replicated in independent cohorts. However, it appears reasonable to assume that there is an association between the SLC6A2 gene variant and power athletic status.
BACKGROUND: Although several studies have investigated possible associations between norepinephrine neurotransmitter transporter gene (SLC6A2) polymorphisms and depression, few studies have examined associations between SLC6A2 polymorphisms and suicide. METHODS: Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2242446, rs28386840, and rs5569) were measured in 550 patients: 201 with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide attempt/s, 160 with MDD without suicide attempts, and 189 healthy controls. Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotype was conducted for the three groups. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age and gender was conducted to identify independent influences of each SNP. A possible association between suicide lethality and SLC6A2 polymorphisms was also investigated. RESULTS: In the genotype and allele frequency analysis, there were significant differences in rs28386840 between suicidal MDD patients and healthy controls. In the haplotype analysis, TAA (rs2242446-rs28386840-rs5569, from left to right) was associated with suicide attempts in MDD, although the significance (p=0.043) disappeared after Bonferroni correction. There were no relationships between lethality scores and SLC6A2 polymorphisms in suicidal MDD. LIMITATIONS: Modest sample size and a single type of neurotransmitter analyzed (norepinephrine) are the primary limitations. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SLC6A2 polymorphisms were associated with suicide risk in patients with MDD. Future studies are warranted to elucidate possible mechanisms by which SLC6A2 polymorphisms influence suicide risk.
We aimed to investigate the associations between genetic variants of the norepinephrine transporter gene (NET, also known as SLC6A2) and diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. In addition, we examined the relationship between the genetic variants and manic and psychotic symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder. The three SNPs rs28386840, rs2242446, and rs5569 were genotyped in 326 patients: patients with bipolar I disorder (n = 160) and a control group (n = 166). Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age and sex was conducted to identify independent influences of the SNPs on diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. A possible association between manic and psychotic symptoms and variants of SLC6A2 was also investigated in patients with bipolar I disorder. The rs28836840 SNP in the 5'-UTR of SLC6A2 was significantly associated with bipolar I disorder and with severity of manic and psychotic symptoms in this disorder. Individuals carrying a T allele in the rs28836840 SNP were likely to have a lower risk of bipolar I disorder or lower severity of manic and psychotic symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I disorder diagnosis: OR = 0.643, 95% Cl = 0.468-0.883, p = 0.006; manic symptoms: beta = -2.457, 95% Cl = -4.674 ~ -0.239, p = 0.031; psychotic symptoms: beta = -2.501, 95% Cl = -4.700 ~ -0.301, p = 0.027). For the rs2242446 and rs5569 SNPs, there were no significant differences between patients with bipolar I disorder and those without. Our results revealed associations of the rs28386840 SNP with bipolar I disorder diagnosis and with severity of manic and psychotic symptoms. However, the findings reported here require replication in larger samples and various ethnic groups.
Numerous genetic factors have been shown to influence athletic performance, but the list is far from comprehensive. In this study, we analyzed genetic variants in two genes related to mental abilities, SLC6A2 (rs1805065) and SYNE1 (rs2635438) in a group of 890 athletes (320 endurance, 265 power, and 305 combat athletes) vs. 1009 sedentary controls. Genotyping of selected SNPs was performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. SLC6A2 codes for norepinephrine transporter, a protein involved in modulating mood, arousal, memory, learning, and pain perception, while SYNE1 encodes protein important for the maintenance of the cerebellum-the part of the brain that coordinates complex body movements. Both SNPs (rs2635438 and rs1805065) showed no statistically significant differences between the frequencies of variants in the athletes and the sedentary controls (athletes vs. control group) or in the athlete subgroups (martial vs. control, endurance vs. control, and power vs. control). The rs1805065 T variant of SLC6A2 was found to be overrepresented in male high-elite martial sports athletes when compared to sedentary controls (OR = 6.56, 95%CI = 1.82-23.59, p = 0.010). This supports the hypothesis that genetic variants potentially affecting brain functioning can influence elite athletic performance and indicate the need for further genetic association studies, as well as functional analyses.
AIM: The NET, encoded by SLC6A2, is responsible for presynaptic NE-reuptake. (123)I-mIBG is clinically used to evaluate cardiac sympathetic function. However, it is unknown if polymorphism of SLC6A2 influences cardiac sympathetic activity as assessed with (123)I-mIBG. Therefore we studied the influence of SLC6A2 SNPs on myocardial (123)I-mIBG parameters in CHF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine adults with stable CHF (age 66.5 +/- 8.1 years, LVEF 22.3 +/- 6.4) were enrolled. Fifteen minutes (early) and 4 hours (late) after administration of (123)I-mIBG planar images were acquired. The H/M ratio was calculated from the manually drawn ROI over the left ventricle and a fixed mediastinal ROI. Fourteen exons of the SLC6A2 gene were analyzed from whole blood samples. RESULTS: We found 6 different SLC6A2 SNPs, although none were functional. LVEF was the only independent predictor for early (adjusted R (2) = 0.063, p = 0.045) and late H/M ratio (adjusted R (2) = 0.116, p = 0.010). NT-proBNP was the only independent predictor for (123)I-mIBG WO (adjusted R (2) = 0.074, p = 0.032). SLC6A2 SNPs were not associated with any myocardial (123)I-mIBG-derived parameter. CONCLUSION: In this specific CHF population polymorphism of SLC6A2 gene was not associated with any (123)I-mIBG derived parameters.
Reduced function of the noradrenaline transporter (NET) has been demonstrated in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and panic disorder. Attempts to explain NET dysfunction in MDD and panic disorder by genetic variation in the NET gene SLC6a2 have been inconclusive. Transcriptional silencing of the SLC6a2 gene may be an alternative mechanism which can lead to NET dysfunction independent of DNA sequence. The objective of this study was to characterise the DNA methylation state of the SLC6a2 gene promoter in patients with MDD and panic disorder. SLC6a2 promoter methylation was also analysed before and after antidepressant treatment. This study was performed with DNA from blood, using bisulphite sequencing and EpiTYPER methylation analyses. Patients with MDD or panic disorder were not found to differ significantly from healthy controls in the pattern of methylation of the SLC6a2 gene promotor. While significant correlations between methylation levels at some CpG sites and physiological measures were identified, overall the variation in DNA methylation between patients was small, and the significance of this variation remains equivocal. No significant changes in SLC6a2 promoter methylation were observed in response to antidepressant treatment. Further in-depth analysis of alternative mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the SLC6a2 gene in human health and disease would be of value.
We examined the association between the norepinephrine transporter (SLC6A2) gene and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a Korean population. In addition, we investigated which phenotypes of ASD are best attributed to the genotype of SLC6A2. A total of 184 subjects with ASD, their 156 unaffected siblings and both biological parents were recruited through university hospitals. We used the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), the Stroop Colour-Word Interference Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) as quantitative measures of the ASD phenotypes. The associations between the quantitative measures and specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested with linear regression analyses. We did not find any evidence of the over-transmission of either allele of the 10SLC6A2 SNPs in the DFAM test. At an empirical p value <0.05, findings that were consistent between the linear regression analyses and the QFAM tests were the positive associations between the A allele of rs36020 and attention problems on the CBCL and stereotypical behaviours on the ABC and between the C allele of rs1814270 and the number of trials required to complete the first WCST category. However, these associations did not remain after correction for multiple testing. The study results of this study do not support the association between the SLC6A2 and the diagnosis or phenotype of ASD. However, the study must be replicated in larger populations and with using more genetic markers.
OBJECTIVE: Venlafaxine, an antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) type, is used to treat patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Much evidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms may modulate serotonergic and noradrenergic function, thereby affecting the treatment efficacy of venlafaxine. The aim of this study was to examine whether polymorphisms in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associate with remission after venlafaxine treatment for MDD. METHOD: An 8-week naturalistic treatment study with venlafaxine was carried out in 243 Han Chinese patients with MDD. The patients were screened for seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the SLC6A2 gene. Of the enrolled patients, 161 completed the 8-week treatment. The 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used to assess the improvement of depressive symptoms in each subject from baseline to the endpoint. For better presentation of time-course change of remission status, a Cox regression analysis for remission incidence during the 8-week treatment was conducted. RESULTS: Between remitters and non-remitters, significant differences in genotype frequencies were observed in five of the investigated SLC6A2 variants (rs28386840, rs1532701, rs40434, rs13333066, rs187714). GCG haplotype (rs40434 - rs13333066 - rs187714) in the SLC6A2 gene showed a association with non-remission. A Cox regression analysis for remission incidence during the 8-week treatment course significantly depends on SLC6A2 variants (rs28386840, rs40434, and rs187714). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the variation of the SLC6A2 gene is associated with treatment remission after venlafaxine in patients with MDD.
OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to identify the association of norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2), synaptosomal-associated protein of the 25-kDa gene (SNAP-25), and latrophilin 3 gene (LPHN3) with osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system methylphenidate (OROS MPH) treatment response. METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were recruited. We selected rs192303, rs3785143 in SLC6A2; rs3746544 (1065 T>G) in SNAP-25; and rs6551665, rs1947274, and rs2345039 in LPHN3 to examine the association of OROS MPH treatment response with each single nucleotide polymorphism. We first defined good response group when the Korean version of the ADHD rating scale score at 8 weeks was decreased for more than 50% of baseline scores and compared genotype frequencies in good response group with poor group. Second, we defined it when the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score at 8 weeks was 1 or 2, and we also analyzed the genotype frequencies. RESULTS: There was a significant association between the 1065 T>G of SNAP-25 gene and OROS MPH response, with the good response group defined by the Korean version of ADHD rating scale scores; 33.3% of the subjects with GG genotype showed a good response, whereas 74.7% of those with TT genotype and 72.5% of those with TG genotype showed good responses (P=0.034). SLC6A2 rs192303 was related with OROS MPH treatment response when we defined good treatment response by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that SNAP-25 gene and SLC6A2 were involved with OROS MPH response.
The human norepinephrine transporter (NET) is an established drug target for a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Conventional methods that are used to functionally characterize NET inhibitors are based on the use of radiolabeled or fluorescent substrates. These methods are highly informative, but pose limitations to either high-throughput screening (HTS) adaptation or physiologically accurate representation of the endogenous uptake events. Recently, we developed a label-free functional assay based on the activation of G protein-coupled receptors by a transported substrate, termed the TRACT assay. In this study, the TRACT assay technology was applied to NET expressed in a doxycycline-inducible HEK 293 JumpIn cell line. Three endogenous substrates of NET-norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and epinephrine (EP)-were compared in the characterization of the reference NET inhibitor nisoxetine. The resulting assay, using NE as a substrate, was validated in a manual HTS set-up with a Z' = 0.55. The inhibitory potencies of several reported NET inhibitors from the TRACT assay showed positive correlation with those from an established fluorescent substrate uptake assay. These findings demonstrate the suitability of the TRACT assay for HTS characterization and screening of NET inhibitors and provide a basis for investigation of other solute carrier transporters with label-free biosensors.
