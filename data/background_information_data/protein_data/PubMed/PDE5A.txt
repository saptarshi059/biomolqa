In this study, 16 new ent-labdane-type diterpene glycosides, designated as goshonosides J1-J16 (1-16), along with nine previously known diterpene glycosides (17-25) were extracted from the fruits of Rubus chingii Hu. The structures of goshonosides J1-J16 were elucidated using various analytical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, electron capture detector ECD, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry HREIMS, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and hydrolysis. Furthermore, the isolates' efficacy in inhibiting the activity of phosphodiesterase type 5 A was evaluated. Goshonosides J1, J2, and G effectively inhibited the activity of the aforementioned enzyme (IC(50) values: 6.15 +/- 1.76, 3.27 +/- 0.65, and 9.61 +/- 2.36 muM, respectively). Our findings highlight the remarkable structural diversity of bioactive compounds in R. chingii Hu and offer insights into the use of this shrub.
The phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) gene is highly specific to cyclic GMP (cGMP) and several experimental studies have shown that the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The present study was conducted to investigate the association among 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PDE5A and childhood IgAN. The genotyping data from 160 patients with childhood IgAN and 454 controls showed a significant difference in rs13124532 (codominant, P = 0.005; dominant, P = 0.005). Furthermore, patient subgroup analysis revealed an association between the development of proteinuria (>4 and <or=4 mg/m(2)/h) and rs13124532 (codominant, P = 0.008; dominant, P = 0.011), and between the nephrotic range proteinuria (> 40 mg/m(2)/h) and rs11734241 (dominant, P = 0.035), rs12510138 (dominant, P = 0.028), rs13134665 (dominant, P = 0.025), rs3822192 (dominant, P = 0.027), rs10013305 (dominant, P = 0.020), rs1480940 (dominant, P = 0.020), rs1480936 (dominant, P = 0.019), rs11947234 (dominant, P = 0.019), and rs2127823 (dominant, P = 0.026). The pathological findings showed that rs13124532 had an association with podocyte foot process effacement (codominant, P = 0.035; dominant, P = 0.044) and with pathological progression (codominant, P = 0.046). Our results suggest that PDE5A is associated with increased disease susceptibility, pathological progression, and development of proteinuria in childhood IgAN.
BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) cleave phosphodiester bonds in cyclic nucleotides and play diverse roles in cell biology. PDE5A is a cytoplasmic phosphodiesterase which specifically degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a cell signaling molecule that plays important roles in neuronal signaling and vascular smooth muscle contraction. Inhibition of PDE5A induces headache resembling migraine headaches. AIM: To test the hypothesis that Ser102 and Ser104 in PDE5A and/or their phosphoserine derivatives 1) regulate the intracellular localization and/or activity of PDE5A, and 2) modulate the interaction between PDE5A and pharmaceutical reagents in clinical or pre-clinical use for migraine headaches and other types of vascular dysfunction. METHODS: Wild type PDE5A or PDE5A with substitution mutations (Ser102Ala, Ser104Ala or Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala) were overexpressed in SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells as C-terminal fusions with green fluorescent protein. Transfected cells were treated with sildenafil, cilostazol, glyceryl trinitrate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or sumatriptan. PDE5A-GFP fusion proteins were localized in fixed cells by immunofluorescence and PDE activity was quantified in cell extracts by standard in vitro assay using [3H] cGMP. RESULTS: The intracellular distribution of wild-type, single and double mutant PDE5A was similar and was not altered by exposure to sildenafil, cilostazol, glyceryl trinitrate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or sumatriptan. PDE5 activity was similar for wild type, Ser102Ala and Ser104Ala PDE5A, but activity of the Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala mutant was approximately two-fold higher than wild type. Double mutant Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala migrated as a single band on a native acrylamide gel, while wild-type and single mutant PDE5A migrated as a doublet. INTERPRETATION: Ser102 and Ser104 may influence the conformational flexibility of PDE5A, which may in turn influence phosphorylation status, allosteric regulation by cGMP or other as yet unknown regulatory mechanisms for PDE5A. PDE5A activation could be important in reversal of migraine-like headache.
BACKGROUND: PDE5A is a phosphodiesterase which specifically hydrolyzes the cGMP to GMP. It takes part in several physiological and pathological pathways and is considered an important drug target. Currently, PDE5 inhibitors (ex; Sildenafil, Tadalafil) available in the market are not only being used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction but at the same time, they are also in clinical trials being investigated as anticancer agents. MATERIALS & METHODS: In this work, we have examined pyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3-ones as PDE5A inhibitors. Pyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3-ones are the class of tricyclic heterocyclic derivatives having a variety of therapeutically interesting drug candidates known for their anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-anxiety and anti-cancer activity. Therefore, synthetic methods providing access to pyrazolo [4, 3-c] quinolin-3-ones are immensely valuable. Here, we are reporting a simple but efficient route for the synthesis of novel 8-morpholino-2-aryl - 2, 5-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo [4, 3-c] quinolin-3-one derivatives. RESULTS: Further, molecular docking studies of synthesized compounds with human PDE5A protein showed that all the compounds exhibited good docking score in comparison with known inhibitors. In addition, all the synthesized molecules were evaluated against HCT116 cell lines for their antitumor activity. CONCLUSION: Among all the synthesized compounds, compound 5a, 5d, and 6e showed better cytotoxicity. Thus, these derivatives can be studied as potential inhibitors of PDE5A.
Thyroid cancer (TC) remains a prevalent public health concern. To further study the molecular mechanism of TC development, we explored the regulatory mechanism and function of lncRNA ARAP1-AS1 in TC progression. The verification of ARAP1-AS1, PDE5A and miR-516b-5p expression levels among the TC cell lines and tissues was fulfilled via RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation experiments were executed to assess ARAP1-AS1's biological function in vitro. Western blotting was conducted to assess apoptosis through the expressions of apoptotic markers. A tumor xenograft experiment was conducted to evaluate whether ARAP1-AS1 affected TC tumor development in vivo . The interactions of miR-516b-5p with ARAP1-AS1 and PDE5A were explored through a dual-luciferase reporter and RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation assays, as well as through Pearson's correlation analysis. ARAP1-AS1 and PDE5A were evidently upregulated in the TC cell lines and tissues whereas miR-516b-5p was poorly expressed. ARAP1-AS1 silencing in TC cells hampered cell proliferation, reduced their viability and boosted apoptosis. Moreover, it inhibited tumor growth in vivo . ARAP1-AS1 had been revealed to be correlated negatively to miR-516b-5p. Finally, we demonstrated that the miR-516b-5p inhibitor was capable of reversing ARAP1-AS1-knockdown's repressive effects on TC cell development by means of regulating PDE5A expression. ARAP1-AS1 partially facilitated TC cell development and survival through the modulation of miR-516b-5p/PDE5A axis. This contributes a novel biomarker and new perspectives for TC treatment.
INTRODUCTION: Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are risk factors for erectile dysfunction (ED). Selective inhibitors of the type 5 phosphodiesterase are the first option for treating ED. However, it is unknown why there are patients with low response to this treatment. Polymorphisms in the PDE5A gene may influence the response to PDE5 inhibitors treatment. AIM: The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between PDE5A polymorphisms, diabetes, and the efficacy of sildenafil treatment. METHODS: A Spanish prospective cohort of 170 Caucasian male patients diagnosed with ED and ischemic heart disease treated with angioplasty was studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ED was evaluated according to the 5-item version of the International Index for Erectile Function before and after treatment with sildenafil 50 mg. The gene sequence of the PDE5A gene was analyzed for the presence of rs12646525 and rs3806808 polymorphisms. Glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were measured in blood serum samples. The relationship between treatment response, genotype, and glycemic status was analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with G-allele of rs3806808 polymorphism showed a worse response to the treatment compared to TT-homozygote patients. Nondiabetic G-allele carriers showed a worse treatment response than TT-homozygotes patients. These differences were not seen in diabetic patients. There were no significant differences in treatment response according to the rs12646525 polymorphism in total population or according to the glycemic status. Logistic regression analysis showed that nondiabetic carriers of the major allele of both the rs12646525 and rs3806808 polymorphism had a significantly higher likelihood to respond to the treatment than diabetic patients carriers of the minor allele (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The response to sildenafil treatment depends on polymorphisms in the PDE5A gene and the glycemic status of the patients.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) possess both tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Among all the thyroid cancers, PTC is the most prevalent form. Herein, we aim to determine the regulatory mechanisms and functions of lncRNA XIST in the multiplication, invasion, and survival of PTC. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot experiments were performed to determine the patterns of lncRNA XIST, miR-330-3p, and PDE5A expressions. The subcellular localization of XIST was determined through subcellular fractionation. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to determine miR-330-3p's relationships with XIST and PDE5A, which were further confirmed through luciferase reporter assays. Loss-of-function combined with Transwell, CCK-8, and caspase-3 activity experiments were performed to determine the mechanism of the XIST/miR-330-3p/PDE5A axis in regulating the malignancy of PTC cells. Xenograft tumor experiment was employed to study the influence of XIST on tumor development in vivo. The PTC cell lines and tissues manifested considerably high levels of lncRNA XIST expression. The XIST knockdown inhibited proliferation, blocked migration, and strengthened apoptosis among PTC cells. Moreover, its knockdown suppressed PTC tumor development in vivo. XIST repressed miR-330-3p to stimulate the malignant behaviors of PTC. Through the downregulation of PDE5A, miR-330-3p attenuated the capability of PTC cells to grow, migrate, and survive. lncRNA XIST promotes tumor development in PTC through the regulation of the miR-330-3p/PDE5A axis. The findings from this study provide new insights into the treatment of PTC.
BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common forms of thyroid cancer with a cure rate of over 90% after surgery. However, aggressive forms may still occur, and personalized therapeutic strategies are increasingly required. METHODS: We performed integrated genomic and proteomic analysis of PTC tumor samples from patients who did not harbor BRAF or RAS mutations. We validate the analysis and present in-depth molecular analysis of the identified genetic rearrangement by employing biochemical and cell biological assays. Finally, we employ 3D spheroid models, loss of function studies and chemical inhibitors to target the hitherto upregulated factors. The data are analysed with appropriate statistical tests which are mentioned in the legends section. RESULTS: In a 23-year-old patient with thyroiditis, we identified a novel rearrangement leading to a BAIAP2L1-BRAF fusion that transforms immortalized human thyroid cells in a kinase and CC-domain dependent manner. Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis of the same patient samples revealed the upregulation of several proteins including the Ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM25, PDE5A, and PKCdelta. Further, in a cohort of PTC patients, we observed higher expression of TRIM25 and PKCdelta in the tumor and metastatic lesions, when compared to the matched normal tissue. Inhibition of TRIM25, PDE5A and PKCdelta with small molecules or RNA interference affected not only viability and proliferation of BAIAP2L1-BRAF transformed cells, but also the viability, growth and invasion of corresponding 3D spheroid cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from unveiling a novel oncogenic BRAF fusion in PTCs, our data may open a novel avenue of therapeutic targeting in human PTCs.
