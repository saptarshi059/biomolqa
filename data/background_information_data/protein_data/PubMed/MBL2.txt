Mannose-binding protein C; Calcium-dependent lectin involved in innate immune defense. Binds mannose, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine on different microorganisms and activates the lectin complement pathway. Binds to late apoptotic cells, as well as to apoptotic blebs and to necrotic cells, but not to early apoptotic cells, facilitating their uptake by macrophages. May bind DNA.
MBL2 gene encodes mannose-binding lectin, is a member of innate immune system. Earlier studies revealed that MBL2 gene variants, rs1800451, rs1800450, rs5030737, rs7096206, rs11003125 and rs7095891 are associated with impaired serum level and susceptibility to TB, but their results are inconsistent. A meta-analysis was performed by including 22 studies (7095 TB-patients and 7662 controls) and data were analyzed with respect to associations between alleles, genotypes and minor allele carriers to evaluate the potential association between MBL2 polymorphisms and TB risk. Statistically significant results were found only for the homozygous variant genotype (CC vs. AA: p = 0.045; OR = 0.834, 95% CI = 0.699 to 0.996) of rs1800451 and showed reduced risk of TB in overall population. However, other genetic models of rs1800450, rs5030737, rs7096206, rs11003125, rs7095891 and combined rs1800450, rs1800451, rs5030737 polymorphisms of MBL2 gene did not reveal any association with TB risk. Stratified analysis by ethnicity showed decreased risk of TB in African population for rs1800450 and rs1800451. Whereas, no association was observed between other MBL2 polymorphisms and TB risk in all the evaluated ethnic populations. In conclusion, MBL2 rs1800450 and rs1800451 polymorphisms play a protective role in TB infection and reinforce their critical significance as a potential genetic marker for TB resistance.
We performed MBL2 genotyping in 47 CF patients-cared of at the regional CF Centre of Trieste-trying to establish a correlation within allelic variants of MBL2 and modification of patients' clinical outcome. FEV1 values were significantly lowered and a significantly earlier age at onset of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation was found in CF patients with at least one MBL2 variant.
BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal recessive disorder among Caucasians. Over 1500 mutations have been identified in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator disease-gene so far. A large variability of the clinical phenotype has been observed both in cystic fibrosis patients bearing the same genotype, and in affected sibpairs. Thus, genes inherited independently from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator could modulate the clinical expression of cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We analysed some putative modifier genes of liver cystic fibrosis phenotype (serpin 1, hemochromatosis, transferrin receptor 2, ferroportin 1, mannose binding lectin and adenosine triphospate-binding cassette subfamily B member 4) in 108 unrelated cystic fibrosis patients with and without liver involvement. RESULTS: HYPD mannose binding lectin haplotype was significantly (p<0.05) more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients with liver disease versus those without liver disease. This haplotype already related to a more severe pulmonary cystic fibrosis phenotype, is associated to a reduced MBL immunological activity. The c.834-66G>T variant of adenosine triphospate-binding cassette subfamily B member 4 gene was significantly (p<0.05) less frequent in cystic fibrosis patients with liver disease as compared to those with no liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: The HYPD mannose binding lectin haplotype may predispose a subgroup of cystic fibrosis patients to a more severe liver involvement impairing the local defence mechanisms whereas the c.834-66G>T adenosine triphospate-binding cassette subfamily B member 4 variant may enhance the activity of the protein and thus exert a protective effect toward liver disease.
OBJECTIVES: Mannose binding lectin (MBL) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk with inconsistent results. This study aimed to explore whether MBL2 A\B, A\C, A\D, A\O, L\H and Y\X polymorphisms affected SLE susceptibility. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on 20 studies, containing allelic contrast, additive, dominant and recessive models. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated to reflect the effect of association. RESULTS: A total of 64 pooled comparisons were conducted, including 7194 SLE patients and 7401 healthy controls. The meta-analysis inducted a significant association between allele B and SLE (OR = 0.766, 95% CI = 0.681-0.862, P < .001). The genotype BB in the additive model and AB + BB in the recessive model both reduced the risk of SLE (OR = 0.611, 95% CI = 0.422-0.882, P = .009; OR = 0.806, 95% CI = 0.688-0.944, P = .008). Regarding A\O polymorphisms, results revealed statistical differences in allelic contrast, additive model and recessive models (OR = 0.826, 95% CI = 0.732-0.931, P = .002; OR = 0.737, 95% CI = 0.557-0.977, P = .034 and OR = 0.793, 95% CI = 0.683-0.921, P = .002, respectively). As for L\H, meta-analysis revealed that allele H and genotype HH both decreased SLE susceptibility in allelic contrast and dominant models (OR = 1.463, 95% CI = 1.097-2.007, P = .018; OR = 1.383, 95% CI = 1.124-1.701, P = .002). Stratification by ethnicity indicated that allele H related to SLE in European populations (OR = 0.736, 95% CI = 0.617-0.879, P = .001), and the recessive model correlated with SLE in Asians (OR = 0.808, 95% CI = 0.667-0.979, P = .03). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that A\B and A\O polymorphisms were associated with SLE susceptibility, and the allele H may be a protective factor in SLE.
Pyrosequencing represents one of the most thorough methods used to analyze polymorphisms. One advantage of using pyrosequencing for genotyping is the ability to identify not only single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but also tri-allelic variations, insertions and deletions (InDels). In contrast to most other genotyping assays the sequence surrounding the polymorphism provides an internal control making this method highly reliable.
We investigated the possible role of Mannose binding lectin 2 (MBL2) functional polymorphisms in the prevalence of hypertension and hypertensive end-organ damage in 300 hypertensive patients and 313 normotensive individuals from Southern Brazil. Hypertensive subjects with MBL2 AO/OO genotypes presented lower C-reactive protein levels than AA individuals and consequently lower inflammatory status.
The complement system may be crucial during dengue virus infection and progression to severe dengue. This study investigates the role of MBL2 genetic variants and levels of MBL in serum and complement proteins in Vietnamese dengue patients. MBL2 genotypes (- 550L/H, MBL2 codon 54), MBL2 diplotypes (XA/XO, YA/XO) and MBL2 haplotypes (LXPB, HXPA, XO) were associated with dengue in the study population. The levels of complement factors C2, C5, and C5a were higher in dengue and dengue with warning signs (DWS) patients compared to those in healthy controls, while factor D levels were decreased in dengue and DWS patients compared to the levels determined in healthy controls. C2 and C5a levels were associated with the levels of AST and ALT and with WBC counts. C9 levels were negatively correlated with ALT levels and WBC counts, and factor D levels were associated with AST and ALT levels and with platelet counts. In conclusions, MBL2 polymorphisms are associated with dengue in the Vietnamese study population. The levels of the complement proteins C2, C4b, C5, C5a, C9, factor D and factor I are modulated in dengue patients during the clinical course of dengue.
BACKGROUND: Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes enclosing the brain and spinal cord. It is a fatal disease with severe morbidity and mortality. Mannose binding lectin (MBL) encoded by MBL2 gene activates complement system through lectin pathway in innate immunity to defense against the infections. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate the promoter and exon 1 variants of MBL2 gene among Egyptian patients having meningitis to explore their role in disease susceptibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study, included 53 patients and 50 sex and age matched controls. MBL2 genotyping was done using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The frequency of one promoter (c.-290C > G) and four in exon 1 (c.161G > A, c.170G > A, c.154C > T and c.132C > T) as well as another one located in its 5'utranslated part (c.-66C > T) variants were estimated. The incidence of the four individual exonic variants was not significantly different between cases and healthy individuals (all P > 0.05). The promoter variant, c.-290C > G was found in all examined patients (84.9% of the patients in homozygote state and 15.1% of patients in heterozygous state) with a highly significant variance in the prevalence of this variant between cases and control group (p = 0.0001). Additionally, UTR variant (c.-66C > T) was also significantly higher in patients than controls (P = 0.033).In comparison with clinical outcome, it was found that c.170G > A variant named C allele was associated with favorable outcome in the studied patients (P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: The results obtained showed that the Promoter (c.-290C > G) and UTR (c.-66C > T) variants of MBL2 gene may be potential risk factors for disease susceptibility in Egyptian cases with meningitis. Our results also proposed that c.170G > A (C allele and CC genotype) could affect the severity and play a protective role in these patients. The other genetic variants of MBL2 gene, including c.132C > T, c.161G > A (A > B), and c.154C > T (A > D) that were investigated, did not show any association with susceptibility or severity of meningitis.
Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the ficolins (Ficolin-1, Ficolin-2 and Ficolin-3) are soluble collagen-like proteins that are involved in innate immune defence. They bind sugar structures or acetylated compounds present on microorganisms and on dying host cells and they initiate activation of the lectin complement pathway in varying degrees. Common variant alleles situated both in promoter and structural regions of the human MBL gene (MBL2) influence the stability and the serum concentration of the protein. Although not as thoroughly investigated as the MBL2 gene polymorphisms the ficolin genes (FCNs) also exhibit genetic variations affecting both the serum concentration, stability and binding capacity of the corresponding proteins. Epidemiological studies have suggested that the genetically determined variations in MBL serum concentrations influence the susceptibility to and the course of different types of diseases, while the importance of the ficolins in general and the genetic variation in the FCNs genes in particular is still largely unresolved. This overview will summarize the current molecular knowledge of the human MBL2, FCN1, FCN2 and FCN3 genes.
Recently several authors correlated MBL-2 gene polymorphisms with different pathologies and there is a growing interest for MBL-2 genotyping in a large number of individuals. We have developed a single-tube, rapid, economic, and fully automated melting temperature analysis screening method, based on ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System technology and SYBR Green I chemistry, for the detection of three polymorphisms (exon 1, codons 52, 54, 57) in the MBL-2 gene. We also developed an electronic sheet for the automatic calling of different genotypes, based on the analysis of the first derivative of ABI 7700 raw data.
OBJECTIVES: Sars-CoV-2 acute infection is clinically heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic cases to patients with a severe, systemic clinical course. Among the involved factors age and preexisting morbidities play a major role; genetic host susceptibility contributes to modulating the clinical expression and outcome of the disease. Mannose-binding lectin is an acute-phase protein that activates the lectin-complement pathway, promotes opsonophagocytosis and modulates inflammation, and is involved in several bacterial and viral infections in humans. Understanding its role in Sars-CoV-2 infection could help select a better therapy. METHODS: We studied MBL2 haplotypes in 419 patients with acute COVID-19 in comparison to the general population and related the haplotypes to clinical and laboratory markers of severity. RESULTS: We recorded an enhanced frequency of MBL2 null alleles in patients with severe acute COVID-19. The homozygous null genotypes were significantly more frequent in patients with advanced WHO score 4-7 (OR of about 4) and related to more severe inflammation, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with a defective MBL2 genotype (i.e., 0/0) are predisposed to a more severe acute Sars-CoV-2 infection; they may benefit from early replacement therapy with recombinant MBL. Furthermore, a subset of subjects with the A/A MBL genotype develop a relevant increase of serum MBL during the early phases of the disease and develop a more severe pulmonary disease; in these patients, the targeting of the complement may help. Therefore, COVID-19 patients should be tested at hospitalization with serum MBL analysis and MBL2 genotype, to define the optimal therapy.
Mannose-binding lectin has recently been identified as a modifier of severity in cystic fibrosis, although studies have produced differing results and the mechanism of action remains unclear. The current authors have studied large cohorts of adults (n=298) and children (n=260) to explore this apparent relationship further. Adults with two structural mutations, but not heterozygotes, had significantly reduced lung function and oxygen saturations, more frequent hospital admissions and raised systemic inflammatory markers. This was not related to increased rates of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and there was no increased susceptibility to Burkholderia cepacia. None of these findings was mirrored in the paediatric cohort. In conclusion, severe mannose-binding lectin deficiency appears to be detrimental to cystic fibrosis adults, although heterozygotes are not affected. It is suggested that this is not related to impaired complement-mediated bacterial killing, and a link with the host inflammatory response is hypothesised. If mannose-binding lectin replacement is developed as a new approach to treatment for this disease, the present study would suggest that the small group of severely deficient patients with two structural mutations may be the group to benefit.
Either immune selection or stochastic processes may have influenced the frequency of highly polymorphic genes such as mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2). This pattern recognition receptor of the innate immune system recognizes and binds to pathogenic microorganisms and apoptotic cells leading to lectin pathway complement killing or clearance. In almost all of a large number of studies in different ethnic groups worldwide there is 20-25% carriage of low MBL2 haplotypes, with 8-10% of each population having no MBL detectable in the blood. The source of this high variability of MBL2 remains cryptic. It arises from six main snps in the prompter and exon regions of the gene that assort into seven common haplotypes under linkage disequilibrium. While global studies of MBL2 show that it is not under immune selection pressure, these results are not the same when the same population genetic tools are used on large national studies. Other analyses point to the silenced MBL1 pseudogene and development of promoter polymorphisms in humans as evidence of selection pressure favouring low-producing haplotypes. While these analyses cannot be reconciled readily, there are two processes by which MBL heterozygosity could have been advantageous in an evolutionary sense; protection against adverse effects of various infectious diseases and lethal manifestations of atherosclerosis - a disease that now seems to have a more ancient history than assumed previously. Ultimately, consideration of the context for possible future therapeutic manipulation of MBL means that this can proceed independently of resolution of the evolutionary forces that have shaped MBL2 polymorphism.
BACKGROUND: The association between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and the risk of asthma has been evaluated in multiple studies; however, the results are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis to explore whether MBL2 gene polymorphisms were associated with the risk of asthma. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to find relevant articles published up to March 2016. Nine studies, including 2066 cases and 2183 controls, were included in the meta-analysis. The strength of association was evaluated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The results reveal that MBL2 gene polymorphisms (codon 54 A/B, -550 H/L or -221 X/Y) were not associated with the risk of asthma (codon 54 A/B: BB+AB vs AA: OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85-1.23; -550 H/L: LL+HL vs HH: OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03; -221 X/Y: XX+YX vs YY: OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.04). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity implied that the MBL2 codon 54 A/B polymorphism was not significantly associated with the risk of asthma in Asians (BB+AB vs AA: OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.70-1.29) or whites (BB+AB vs AA: OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.84-1.35). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that MBL2 gene polymorphisms (codon 54 A/B, -550 H/L or -221 X/Y) may be not associated with the risk of asthma.
PURPOSE: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is the main known cause of cervical cancer. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a recognition molecule that mediates phagocytosis and activates complement. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association of MBL-2 functional polymorphisms with HPV infection and cervical cancer (CC). RESULTS: The meta-analyses indicated an association between the MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to HPV infection in the recessive model (OO vs. AA + AO, p = 0.042, 95 % CI 1.02-3.15), and O/O vs. A/A mode (P = 0.023, 95 % CI 1.10-3.40) in Caucasian. Meanwhile, there was a significant association between MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms and cervical cancer risk in AO vs. AA model (p = 0.035, 95 % CI 1.03-2.26), and Allelic model (O vs. A, p = 0.022, 95 % CI 1.05-1.96) as compared to HR-HPV-infected patients with CC vs. healthy controls in Caucasian. In addition, no an association was observed between MBL2 -550 H/L and -221 X/Y polymorphisms and HPV infection among Caucasians, but we found an association between the MBL2 -550 H/L polymorphism and susceptibility to HR-HPV infection in recessive model (HH vs. LL + LH, p = 0.003, 95 % CI 1.18-2.23), HH vs. LL model (p = 0.021, 95 % CI 1.07-2.19), and allelic model(H vs. L, p = 0.042, 95 % CI 1.01-1.40) in Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we suggest that the MBL2 gene exon1 polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of high-risk HPV infection and cervical cancer development among Caucasians. Additionally, no significant association was found between the MBL2 -550 H/L or -221 X/Y polymorphisms and HPV infection in Caucasians, but there may be potential links in Asians.
The high prevalence of dental caries in children worldwide is a major oral health problem which requires early intervention. Dental caries is mainly caused by the action of acids produced by bacteria in addition to many other factors. Recent genetic studies have reported that a number of genes are associated with the susceptibility to dental caries. The majority of these genes are associated with inflammation, increased susceptibility to infection, and dentine matrix formation. Using the TaqMan assay and direct DNA sequencing, the prevalence of 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMP9, MBL2, MMP2, and TIMP2 genes was determined in 102 children with caries and in 100 age-matched caries-free controls. Out of the 6 SNPs tested in the 4 selected genes, only rs11003125 in the MBL2 gene was shown to be associated with a high prevalence of caries in our cohort. In addition, haplotype analysis of the 6 SNPs tested revealed that certain haplotypes, namely GT of rs11003125G and rs7501477T and GT of rs7096206G and rs7501477T, were found to be associated with a high prevalence of dental caries in our cohort, while haplotype AG of rs17576A and rs7501477G was found to have a protective effect against dental caries. In conclusion, the data indicate that rs11003125 in the MBL2 gene was shown to be associated with a high prevalence of caries in our cohort, and 2 haplotypes are also involved in the increased susceptibility to dental caries.
Genetic susceptibility is an essential pathogenetic mechanism in autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). MBL2 gene polymorphisms have been shown to play a vital role in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune disorders, but its contribution to AITD is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the linkage between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and AITD susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. One thousand seven hundred sixty seven subjects consisting of 965 AITD patients and 802 controls from a Chinese Han population were enrolled in the case-control study. Four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MBL2 gene were tested using high-throughput sequencing technology for sequence-based SNP genotyping. The allele and genotype distribution results showed that the minor alleles of rs198266, rs10824793, and rs4935046 were significantly lower in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) patients than in healthy controls. In further genetic model analysis, the dominant models of rs1982266, rs10824793, and rs4935046 for MBL2 in the AITD group exhibited a lower risk of morbidity. Finally, we discovered that haplotype AAGC was associated with Graves' disease (GD), while AGC was associated with HT. Our study provides strong evidence for a genetic correlation between MBL2 and AITD, and the polymorphism of the MBL2 gene may be a protective factor for AITD, especially for HT. These findings can advance our understanding of the etiology of AITD, as well as provide guidance for prevention and intervention toward AITD.
Human Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a protein encoded by MBL2 gene involved in the activation of the lectin-complement pathway. Several studies emphasized the role of MBL2 gene in several infectious diseases' susceptibility, including HIV-1 infection. We aim to investigate the impact of 10 MBL2 gene polymorphisms located in the promoter, 5'UTR and exon 1 regions on HIV-1 physiopathology. The polymorphisms genotyping of 400 individuals, which 200 were HIV-1 positive patients and 200 were controls, was performed by PCR-sequencing. Our results showed that rs503037 and rs1800451 polymorphisms are associated with a high risk of HIV-1 infection susceptibility while rs7096206 and rs11003123 showed a protective effect. A significant association between haplotype CGA and HIV-1 infection susceptibility was also found in the exon 1 region. Moreover, rs11003124, rs7084554, rs36014597 and rs11003123 polymorphisms revealed an association with treatment response outcome as measured by RNA viral load. This study highlights the importance of MBL2 polymorphisms in the modulation of HIV-1 infection susceptibility and the contribution to treatment response outcomes among Moroccan subjects.
For COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) cases, detecting host-based factors that predispose to infection is a very important research area. In this study, the aim is to investigate the MBL2 and NOS3 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 patients with lung involvement, whose first nasopharyngeal PCR results were negative. Seventy-nine patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between April-June 2020 who were admitted to a university hospital, and 100 healthy controls were included. In the first statistical analysis performed between PCR-positive, CT-negative and PCR-negative, CT-positive patients; the AB of MBL2 genotype was significantly higher in the first group (p = 0.049). The B allele was also significantly higher in the same subgroup (p = 0.001). The absence of the AB genotype was found to increase the risk of CT positivity by 6.9 times. The AB genotype of MBL2 was higher in healthy controls (p = 0.006). The absence of the AB genotype was found to increase the risk of CT positivity; also, it can be used for early detection and isolation of patients with typical lung involvement who had enough viral loads, but whose initial PCR results were negative.
