Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Mediates the Na(+)-independent uptake of organic anions such as pravastatin, taurocholate, methotrexate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17-beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, estrone sulfate, prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, leukotriene C3, leukotriene E4, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Involved in the clearance of bile acids and organic anions from the liver. Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60) family.
Membrane transporters are now recognized as important determinants of the transmembrane passage of drugs. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) form a family of influx transporters expressed in various tissues important for pharmacokinetics. Of the 11 human OATP transporters, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 are expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes and can facilitate the liver uptake of their substrate drugs. OATP1A2 is expressed on the luminal membrane of small intestinal enterocytes and at the blood-brain barrier, potentially mediating drug transport at these sites. Several clinically used drugs have been identified as substrates of OATP transporters (e.g. many statins are substrates of OATP1B1). Some drugs may inhibit OATP transporters (e.g. cyclosporine) causing pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Moreover, genetic variability in genes encoding OATP transporters can result in marked inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetics. For example, a single nucleotide polymorphism (c.521T > C, p.Val174Ala) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 decreases the ability of OATP1B1 to transport active simvastatin acid from portal circulation into the liver, resulting in markedly increased plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid and an enhanced risk of simvastatin-induced myopathy. SLCO1B1 polymorphism also affects the pharmacokinetics of many other, but not all (fluvastatin), statins and that of the antidiabetic drug repaglinide, the antihistamine fexofenadine and the endothelin A receptor antagonist atrasentan. This review compiles the current knowledge about the expression and function of human OATP transporters, their substrate and inhibitor specificities, as well as pharmacogenetics.
The organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are membrane proteins that mediate uptake of drugs into the liver for subsequent conjugation and biliary excretion, a key step in drug elimination from the human body. Polymorphic variants of these transporters can cause reduced drug clearance and adverse drug effects such as statin-induced rhabdomyolysis, and co-administration of OATP substrates can lead to damaging drug-drug interaction. Despite their clinical relevance in drug disposition and pharmacokinetics, the structure and mechanism of OATPs are unknown. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 bound to synthetic Fab fragments and in functionally distinct states. A single estrone-3-sulfate molecule is bound in a pocket located in the C-terminal half of OATP1B1. The shape and chemical nature of the pocket rationalize the preference for diverse organic anions and allow in silico docking of statins. The structure of OATP1B3 is determined in a drug-free state but reveals a bicarbonate molecule bound to the conserved signature motif and a histidine residue that is prevalent in OATPs exhibiting pH-dependent activity.
Introduction: Thyroid hormone transporters are essential for thyroid hormones to enter target cells. Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 8 is a key transporter and is expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), in neural cells and many other tissues. Patients with MCT8 deficiency have severe neurodevelopmental delays because of cerebral hypothyroidism and chronic sequelae of peripheral thyrotoxicosis. The T3 analog 3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) rescued neurodevelopmental features in animal models mimicking MCT8 deficiency and improved key metabolic features in patients with MCT8 deficiency. However, the identity of the transporter(s) that facilitate TRIAC transport are unknown. Here, we screened candidate transporters that are expressed at the human BBB and/or brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and known thyroid hormone transporters for TRIAC transport. Materials and Methods: Plasma membrane expression was determined by cell surface biotinylation assays. Intracellular accumulation of 1 nM TRIAC was assessed in COS-1 cells expressing candidate transporters in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)/0.1% glucose or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with or without 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Expression of Slc22a8 was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization in brain sections from wild-type and Mct8/Oatp1c1 knockout mice at postnatal days 12, 21, and 120. Results: In total, 59 plasma membrane transporters were selected for screening of TRIAC accumulation (n = 40 based on expression at the human BBB and/or brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and having small organic molecules as substrates; n = 19 known thyroid hormone transporters). Screening of the selected transporter panel showed that 18 transporters facilitated significant intracellular accumulation of TRIAC in DPBS/0.1% glucose or DMEM in the absence of BSA. In the presence of BSA, substantial transport was noted for SLCO1B1 and SLC22A8 (in DPBS/0.1% glucose and DMEM) and SLC10A1, SLC22A6, and SLC22A24 (in DMEM). The zebrafish and mouse orthologs of these transporters similarly facilitated intracellular accumulation of TRIAC. Highest Slc22a8 mRNA expression was detected in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells and choroid plexus epithelial cells at early postnatal time points, but was reduced at P120. Conclusions: Human SLC10A1, SLCO1B1, SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLC22A24 as well as their mouse and zebrafish orthologs are efficient TRIAC transporters. These findings contribute to the understanding of TRIAC treatment in patients with MCT8 deficiency and animal models thereof.
Pharmacogenomics is the examination of how genetic variation influences drug metabolism and response, in terms of both efficacy and safety. In cardiovascular disease, patient-specific diplotypes determine phenotypes, thereby influencing the efficacy and safety of drug treatments, including statins, antiarrhythmics, anticoagulants and antiplatelets. Notably, polymorphisms in key genes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, VKORC1 and SLCO1B1, significantly impact the outcomes of treatment with clopidogrel, warfarin and simvastatin. Furthermore, the CYP2C19 polymorphism influences the pharmacokinetics and safety of the novel hypertrophic cardiomyopathy inhibitor, mavacamten. In this review, we critically assess the clinical application of pharmacogenomics in cardiovascular disease and delineate present and future utilization of pharmacogenomics. This includes insights into identifying missing heritability, the integration of whole genome sequencing and the application of polygenic risk scores to enhance the precision of personalized drug therapy. Our discussion encompasses health economic analyses that underscore the cost benefits associated with pre-emptive genotyping for warfarin and clopidogrel treatments, albeit acknowledging the need for further research in this area. In summary, we contend that cardiovascular pharmacogenomic analyses are underpinned by a wealth of evidence, and implementation is already occurring for some of these gene-drug pairs, but as with any area of medicine, we need to continually gather more information to optimize the use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice.
The impact of copy-number variations (CNVs) on complex human traits remains understudied. We called CNVs in 331,522 UK Biobank participants and performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) between the copy number of CNV-proxy probes and 57 continuous traits, revealing 131 signals spanning 47 phenotypes. Our analysis recapitulated well-known associations (e.g., 1q21 and height), revealed the pleiotropy of recurrent CNVs (e.g., 26 and 16 traits for 16p11.2-BP4-BP5 and 22q11.21, respectively), and suggested gene functionalities (e.g., MARF1 in female reproduction). Forty-eight CNV signals (38%) overlapped with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-GWASs signals for the same trait. For instance, deletion of PDZK1, which encodes a urate transporter scaffold protein, decreased serum urate levels, while deletion of RHD, which encodes the Rhesus blood group D antigen, associated with hematological traits. Other signals overlapped Mendelian disorder regions, suggesting variable expressivity and broad impact of these loci, as illustrated by signals mapping to Rotor syndrome (SLCO1B1/3), renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (HNF1B), or Charcot-Marie-Tooth (PMP22) loci. Total CNV burden negatively impacted 35 traits, leading to increased adiposity, liver/kidney damage, and decreased intelligence and physical capacity. Thirty traits remained burden associated after correcting for CNV-GWAS signals, pointing to a polygenic CNV architecture. The burden negatively correlated with socio-economic indicators, parental lifespan, and age (survivorship proxy), suggesting a contribution to decreased longevity. Together, our results showcase how studying CNVs can expand biological insights, emphasizing the critical role of this mutational class in shaping human traits and arguing in favor of a continuum between Mendelian and complex diseases.
The Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar) is now providing star (*) allele nomenclature for the highly polymorphic human SLCO1B1 gene encoding the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) drug transporter. Genetic variation within the SLCO1B1 gene locus impacts drug transport, which can lead to altered pharmacokinetic profiles of several commonly prescribed drugs. Variable OATP1B1 function is of particular importance regarding hepatic uptake of statins and the risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms. To introduce this important drug transporter gene into the PharmVar database and serve as a unified reference of haplotype variation moving forward, an international group of gene experts has performed an extensive review of all published SLCO1B1 star alleles. Previously published star alleles were self-assigned by authors and only loosely followed the star nomenclature system that was first developed for cytochrome P450 genes. This nomenclature system has been standardized by PharmVar and is now applied to other important pharmacogenes such as SLCO1B1. In addition, data from the 1000 Genomes Project and investigator-submitted data were utilized to confirm existing haplotypes, fill knowledge gaps, and/or define novel star alleles. The PharmVar-developed SLCO1B1 nomenclature has been incorporated by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) 2022 guideline on statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms.
Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. Hyperbilirubinemia is an important clinical sign that needs to be investigated under a stepwise evaluation. Inherited non-hemolytic conjugated hyperbilirubinemic conditions include Dubin-Johnson syndrome (caused by mutations affecting ABCC2 gene) and Rotor syndrome (caused by the simultaneous presence of mutations in SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes). Although classically viewed as benign conditions requiring no treatment, they lately gained an increased interest since recent studies suggested that mutations in the responsible genes leading to hyperbilirubinemia, as well as minor genetic variants, may result in an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. This article provides a comprehensive review on the pathophysiology of Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndromes, presenting the current knowledge concerning the molecular details and basis of these conditions.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the potential impact of CYP2C8 and SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphisms on repaglinide pharmacokinetics. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases. Eligible studies reported data from pharmacokinetic evaluations of repaglinide in healthy adults according to different categories of CYP2C8 and SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphisms. RESULTS: Six studies including a total of 191 participants met the inclusion criteria. We noted that CYP2C8 *1/*3 carriers exhibited lower AUC(0-infinity) (SMD: -0.77; 95%CI: -1.23 to -0.30; P=0.001) and Cmax (SMD: -0.94; 95%CI: - 1.41 to -0.47; P<0.001) than CYP2C8 *1/*1 carriers. There were no significant differences in AUC(0-infinity), Cmax, t1/2 and mean change in blood glucose concentration between *1/*4 and *1/*1 carriers. Further, *3/*3 carriers had lower Cmax (SMD: -1.42; 95%CI: -2.66 to -0.17; P=0.026) than *1/*1 carriers. Additionally, *3/*3 carriers had lower Cmax than *1/*3 carriers (SMD: -1.20; 95%CI: -2.40 to -0.00; P=0.050). Finally, we noted that repaglinide pharmacokinetics did not differ by SLCO1B1 genotype. CONCLUSION: The current systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that the genotype of CYP2C8, but not SLCO1B1, may affect repaglinide pharmacokinetics. However, because of the comparatively insufficient number of published studies included, our conclusions require support from additional studies.
Reports on the association between the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) T521C polymorphism and methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity in patients with malignancies are inconsistent. This meta-analysis evaluated the association between the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism and methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. We performed a systematic review of previous reports from the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to evaluate the effect of the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism on the occurrence of methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. In total, data from five studies including 465 patients were analyzed. Patients had received a high-dose methotrexate regimen (1-5 g/m2). The SLCO1B1 variant allele (C allele) carriers had a 1.9-fold higher risk of hepatotoxicity than wild-type homozygote carriers (TT; OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.14-3.31). This meta-analysis demonstrated that C allele carriers of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than patients with the TT genotype. The SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism may be a useful predictor for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity in patients with malignancies.
BACKGROUND: Statins inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, decrease plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. They can also exert adverse effects, mostly affecting skeletal muscle, ranging from mild myalgia to rhabdomyolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a PubMed search until December 2014, this review summarizes studies on statin effects on muscle mitochondrial morphology and function in the context of myopathy. RESULTS: Possible mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy include lower cholesterol synthesis and production of prenylated proteins, reduced dolichols and increased atrogin-1 expression. Statin-treated patients frequently feature decreased muscle coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) contents, suggesting that statins might impair mitochondrial function. In cell cultures, statins diminish muscle oxygen consumption, promote mitochondrial permeability transient pore opening and generate apoptotic proteins. Animal models confirm the statin-induced decrease in muscle CoQ10, but reveal no changes in mitochondrial enzyme activities. Human studies yield contradictory results, with decreased CoQ10, elevated lipids, decreased enzyme activities in muscle and impaired maximal oxygen uptake in several but not all studies. Some patients are susceptible to statin-induced myopathy due to variations in genes encoding proteins involved in statin uptake and biotransformation such as the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) or cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5). Carriers for carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency and McArdle disease also present with higher prevalence of statin-induced myopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of statins, the pathogenesis of statin-induced myopathy remains unclear, requiring prospective randomized controlled trials with intensive phenotyping also for identifying strategies for its risk assessment, prevention and treatment.
Polymorphisms in drug transporters, like the adenosine triposphate-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) superfamilies, may contribute to the observed diversity in drug response in African patients. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary and analysis of the frequencies and distributions in African populations of ABC and SLC variants that affect drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Of polymorphisms evaluated in African populations, SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and SLC22A6 rs1158626 were found at markedly higher frequencies than in non-African populations. SLCO1B1 rs4149056 was associated with reduction in rifampin exposure, which has implications for dosing this important anti-tuberculosis therapy. SLC22A6 rs1158626 was associated with increased affinity for antiretroviral drugs. Genetic diversity in SLC and ABC transporters in African populations has implications for conventional therapies, notably in tuberculosis and HIV. More PK and PD data in African populations are needed to assess potential for a different response to drugs compared with other global populations.
We investigated genetic determinants of single-dose simvastatin pharmacokinetics in a prospective study of 170 subjects and a retrospective cohort of 59 healthy volunteers. In a microarray-based genomewide association study with the prospective data, the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (p.Val174Ala, rs4149056) single nucleotide variation showed the strongest, genomewide significant association with the area under the plasma simvastatin acid concentration-time curve (AUC; P = 6.0 x 10(-10) ). Meta-analysis with the retrospective cohort strengthened the association (P = 1.6 x 10(-17) ). In a stepwise linear regression candidate gene analysis among all 229 participants, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (P = 1.9 x 10(-13) ) and CYP3A4 c.664T>C (p.Ser222Pro, rs55785340, CYP3A4*2, P = 0.023) were associated with increased simvastatin acid AUC. Moreover, the SLCO1B1 c.463C>A (p.Pro155Thr, rs11045819, P = 7.2 x 10(-6) ) and c.1929A>C (p.Leu643Phe, rs34671512, P = 5.3 x 10(-4) ) variants associated with decreased simvastatin acid AUC. Based on these results and the literature, we classified the volunteers into genotype-predicted OATP1B1 and CYP3A4 phenotype groups. Compared with the normal OATP1B1 function group, simvastatin acid AUC was 273% larger in the poor (90% confidence interval (CI), 137%, 488%; P = 3.1 x 10(-6) ), 40% larger in the decreased (90% CI, 8%, 83%; P = 0.036), and 67% smaller in the highly increased function group (90% CI, 46%, 80%; P = 2.4 x 10(-4) ). Intermediate CYP3A4 metabolizers (i.e., heterozygous carriers of either CYP3A4*2 or CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367)), had 87% (90% CI, 39%, 152%, P = 6.4 x 10(-4) ) larger simvastatin acid AUC than normal metabolizers. These data suggest that in addition to no function SLCO1B1 variants, increased function SLCO1B1 variants and reduced function CYP3A4 variants may affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of simvastatin. Care is warranted if simvastatin is prescribed to patients carrying decreased function SLCO1B1 or CYP3A4 alleles.
Objective: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the associations between SLCO1B1, APOE and CYP2C9 and the lipid-lowering effects and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin. Methods: Studies were searched from inception to March 2023, including three SNPs related to fluvastatin, SLCO1B1, CYP2C9 and APOE. Weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs were analyzed to evaluate the associations between SNPs and outcomes. Results: SLCO1B1 521T>C was associated with lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein reduction. Patients carrying 521CC or total cholesterol had a significantly higher area under the curve than those carrying 521TT, but no significant difference existed. Conclusion: CYP2C9 and SLCO1B1 may be associated with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to use genetic variants to identify factors contributing to the muscular side effects of statins. BACKGROUND: Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are usually well tolerated medications, but muscle symptoms, ranging from mild myalgia to clinically important rhabdomyolysis are an important side effect of these drugs and a leading cause of noncompliance. Recent results suggest that genetic factors increase the risk of statin-related muscle complaints. We performed a systematic review of the medical literature to determine genetic factors associated with statin myopathy. METHODS: We identified English language articles relating statin myopathy and genetic diseases and gene variants via a PubMed search. Articles pertinent to the topic were reviewed in detail. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that some patients are susceptible to statin myopathy because of pre-existing subclinical inherited muscular disorders, or genetic variation in statin uptake proteins encoded by SLCO1B1 or the cytochrome P enzyme system. Variations in genes affecting pain perception and polymorphism in vascular receptors may also contribute to statin myopathy. None of the variants identified in this review suggested novel metabolic mechanisms leading to statin myopathy.
BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze the polymorphism of APOE and SLCO1B1 genotype and correlation with blood lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia in Hunan Province, China. METHODS: Concentration of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were retrospectively analyzed from 396 patients with dyslipidemia from 2016 to 2020. The APOE and SLCO1B1 genotypes were detected by PCR-fluorescent probe. SPSS21.0 software was used to analyze the gene frequency and their correlation. RESULTS: The frequency of E3/E3 genotype was the highest in the APOE gene, reaching 64.14%. The concentrations of LDL-C and TC in E4 phenotype group were the highest and were statistically different from those in E2 and E3 phenotype groups (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in E4 phenotype between the dyslipidemia group and the normolipidemia group (p < 0.05). The frequency of *1b/*1b genotype was the highest in the SLCO1B1 gene, reaching 41.41%. The concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the intermediate OA1P1B1 function group were higher than those in the normal OA1P1B1 function group and the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The genotypes of APOE and SLCO1B1 gene are correlated with concentration of TC and LDL-C, and their genotypes frequency distribution have regional differences.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) and the risk of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Reviews databases were searched through April 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included case-control or cohort studies investigating an association between NAT2, CYP2E1, GST or SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and the ATDILI risk in patients with tuberculosis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three authors screened articles, extracted data and assessed study quality. The strength of association was evaluated for each gene using the pooled OR with a 95% CI based on the fixed-effects or random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the reliability and robustness of the results. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies were included in this analysis (n=26 for CYP2E1, n=35 for NAT2, n=19 for GST, n=4 for SLCO1B1). The risk of ATDILI was significantly increased with the following genotypes: CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI c1/c1 (OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.83), NAT2 slow acetylator (OR=3.30, 95% CI 2.65 to 4.11) and GSTM1 null (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.52). No significant association with ATDILI was found for the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2E1 DraI, GSTT1, GSTM1/GSTT1, SLCO1B1 388A>G and SLCO1B1 521T>C (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ATDILI is more likely to occur in patients with NAT2 slow acetylator genotype, CYP2E1 RsaI/PstI c1/c1 genotype and GSTM1 null genotype. Close monitoring may be warranted for patients with these genotypes.
OBJECTIVE: Statins are the first-choice therapy for dyslipidemia, but their effectiveness can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms. This study was conducted to assess the association of variants of the solute carrier anion transporter family 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene, which encodes a transporter involving the hepatic clearance of the statins and their therapeutic efficacy. METHOD: A systematic review was performed on four electronic databases to identify relevant studies. The pooled mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) in percentage change of concentration of LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, and triglycerides was calculated. Heterogeneity between studies and publication bias, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were also carried out using R software. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies on 24 365 participants and four variants [rs4149056 (c.521T>C), rs2306283 (c.388A>G), rs11045819 (c.463C>A), rs4363657 (g.89595T>C)] were analyzed. A statistically significant association was found between the LDL-C-lowering effectiveness and the rs4149056 and rs11045819 in the heterozygote model; and the rs4149056, rs2306283, and rs11045819 in the homozygote model. In the subgroup analyses, non-Asian populations, simvastatin, and pravastatin showed significant associations between LDL-C-lowering efficacy and the rs4149056 or rs2306283. Significant associations between the rs2306283 and HDL-C-increasing effectiveness were found in the homozygote model. Regarding TC-reducing, significant associations were observed in the heterozygote and homozygote models of the rs11045819. There was no heterogeneity and publication bias among most studies. CONCLUSION: SLCO1B1 variants can be used as signals to predict the statins' effectiveness.
INTRODUCTION: Various pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants differ widely in different ethnicities. and clinical outcomes associated with these variants may also be substantially varied. Literature was searched in different databases, i.e. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and PharmGKB, from inception to 30 June 2022 for this review. AREAS COVERED: Certain PGx variants were distinctly varied in Asian populations compared to the other human populations, e.g. CYP2C19*2,*3,*17; CYP2C9*2,*3; CYP2D6*4,*5,*10,*41; UGT1A1*6,*28; HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*15:21, HLA-B*58:01, and HLA-A*31:01. However, certain other variants do not vary greatly between Asian and other ethnicities, e.g. CYP3A5*3; ABCB1, and SLCO1B1*5. As evident in this review, the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was much stronger in Asian patients taking clopidogrel and who inherited the CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, e.g. CYP2C19*2 and*3, when compared to the western/Caucasian patients. Additionally, the risk of carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) for the patients inheriting HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*15:21 alleles varied significantly between Asian and other ethnicities. In contrast, both Caucasian and Asian patients inheriting the SLCO1B1*5 variant possessed a similar magnitude of muscle toxicity, i.e. myopathy. EXPERT OPINION: Asian countries should take measures toward expanding PGx research, as well as initiatives for the purposes of obtaining clinical benefits from this newly evolving and economically viable treatment model.
Aims: To evaluate the association between SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH). Methods: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, Wan Fang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database from inception to 2022. Results: Nine case-control studies with 1129 cases and 2203 controls were included. Among four SNPs reported in two or more studies, the final results indicated that SNP rs4149014 was significantly associated with decreased ATDH risk (dominant model, odds ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55-0.97; p = 0.03; allele model, odds ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55-0.86; p = 0.001), and the trial sequential analysis also confirmed this significant association. Conclusion: SLCO1B1 gene SNP rs4149014 was significantly associated with lower risk of ATDH susceptibility.
Hyperbilirubinemia is the main mechanism that causes neonatal jaundice, and genetics is one of the risk factors of hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, this study aims to explore the correlation between two genes, UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1, and hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates. One hundred thirty seven neonates were recruited from Division of Clinical Chemistry, Ramathibodi Hospital. UGT1A1*28 and *6 were determined by pyrosequencing whereas, SLCO1B1 388A > G and 521 T > C genetic variants were determined by TaqMan(R) real-time polymerase chain reaction. Neonates carrying with homozygous (AA) and heterozygous (GA) variants in UGT1A1*6 were significantly related to hyperbilirubinemia development compared with wild type (GG; P < 0.001). To the combined of UGT1A1, total bilirubin levels in homozygous variant were higher significantly than heterozygous variant and wild type (P = 0.002, P = 0.003, respectively). Moreover, SLCO1B1 combination was significant differences between the hyperbilirubinemia and the control group (P = 0.041). SLCO1B1 521 T > C variant provide protection for Thai neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (P = 0.041). There are no significant differences in UGT1A1*28 and SLCO1B1 388A > G for the different severity of hyperbilirubinemia. The combined UGT1A1*28 and *6 polymorphism is a strong risk factor for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates. Therefore, we suggest neonates with this gene should be closely observed to avoid higher severities of bilirubin.
