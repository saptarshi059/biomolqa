BACKGROUND: The immune microenvironment assumes a significant role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the current biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of OA are not satisfactory. Our study aims to identify new OA immune-related biomarkers to direct the prevention and treatment of OA using multi-omics data. METHODS: The discovery dataset integrated the GSE89408 and GSE143514 datasets to identify biomarkers that were significantly associated with the OA immune microenvironment through multiple machine learning methods and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The identified signature genes were confirmed using two independent validation datasets. We also performed a two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) study to generate causal relationships between biomarkers and OA using OA genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data (cases n = 24,955, controls n = 378,169). Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) method was used as the main method of causal estimates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness and reliability of the IVW results. RESULTS: Three signature genes (FCER1G, HLA-DMB, and HHLA-DPA1) associated with the OA immune microenvironment were identified as having good diagnostic performances, which can be used as biomarkers. MR results showed increased levels of FCER1G (OR = 1.118, 95% CI 1.031-1.212, P = 0.041), HLA-DMB (OR = 1.057, 95% CI 1.045 -1.069, P = 1.11E-21) and HLA-DPA1 (OR = 1.030, 95% CI 1.005-1.056, P = 0.017) were causally and positively associated with the risk of developing OA. CONCLUSION: The present study identified the 3 potential immune-related biomarkers for OA, providing new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of OA. The MR study provides genetic support for the causal effects of the 3 biomarkers with OA and may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms leading to the development of OA.
BACKGROUND: Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma represent a distinct endotype with persistent airway inflammation and remodeling that is refractory to corticosteroid treatment. CD4(+) T(H)2 cells play a central role in orchestrating asthma pathogenesis, and biologic therapies targeting their cytokine pathways have had promising outcomes. However, not all patients respond well to such treatment, and their effects are not always durable nor reverse airway remodeling. This observation raises the possibility that other CD4(+) T cell subsets and their effector molecules may drive airway inflammation and remodeling. METHODS: We performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of >50,000 airway CD4(+) T cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 30 patients with mild and severe asthma. FINDINGS: We observed striking heterogeneity in the nature of CD4(+) T cells present in asthmatics' airways, with tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells making a dominant contribution. Notably, in severe asthmatics, a subset of CD4(+) T(RM) cells (CD103-expressing) was significantly increased, comprising nearly 65% of all CD4(+) T cells in the airways of male patients with severe asthma when compared to mild asthma (13%). This subset was enriched for transcripts linked to T cell receptor activation (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPA1) and cytotoxicity (GZMB, GZMA) and, following stimulation, expressed high levels of transcripts encoding for pro-inflammatory non-T(H)2 cytokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, TNF, LIGHT) that could fuel persistent airway inflammation and remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the need to look beyond the traditional T2 model of severe asthma to better understand the heterogeneity of this disease.

BACKGROUND: Rare genetic variants cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the contribution of common genetic variation to disease risk and natural history is poorly characterised. We tested for genome-wide association for pulmonary arterial hypertension in large international cohorts and assessed the contribution of associated regions to outcomes. METHODS: We did two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a meta-analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These GWAS used data from four international case-control studies across 11 744 individuals with European ancestry (including 2085 patients). One GWAS used genotypes from 5895 whole-genome sequences and the other GWAS used genotyping array data from an additional 5849 individuals. Cross-validation of loci reaching genome-wide significance was sought by meta-analysis. Conditional analysis corrected for the most significant variants at each locus was used to resolve signals for multiple associations. We functionally annotated associated variants and tested associations with duration of survival. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint in survival analyses. FINDINGS: A locus near SOX17 (rs10103692, odds ratio 1.80 [95% CI 1.55-2.08], p=5.13 x 10(-15)) and a second locus in HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 (collectively referred to as HLA-DPA1/DPB1 here; rs2856830, 1.56 [1.42-1.71], p=7.65 x 10(-20)) within the class II MHC region were associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SOX17 locus had two independent signals associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (rs13266183, 1.36 [1.25-1.48], p=1.69 x 10(-12); and rs10103692). Functional and epigenomic data indicate that the risk variants near SOX17 alter gene regulation via an enhancer active in endothelial cells. Pulmonary arterial hypertension risk variants determined haplotype-specific enhancer activity, and CRISPR-mediated inhibition of the enhancer reduced SOX17 expression. The HLA-DPA1/DPB1 rs2856830 genotype was strongly associated with survival. Median survival from diagnosis in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with the C/C homozygous genotype was double (13.50 years [95% CI 12.07 to >13.50]) that of those with the T/T genotype (6.97 years [6.02-8.05]), despite similar baseline disease severity. INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to report that common genetic variation at loci in an enhancer near SOX17 and in HLA-DPA1/DPB1 is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Impairment of SOX17 function might be more common in pulmonary arterial hypertension than suggested by rare mutations in SOX17. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping and survival, and to determine whether HLA typing or rs2856830 genotyping improves risk stratification in clinical practice or trials.

OBJECTIVE: NK cells play crucial roles in the immune defense mechanisms against viral infections and transformed cells. However, the developmental progression, transcriptomic landscape, and functional subtypes of liver NK cells are not well defined. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 80% of primary liver cancer worldwide, yet the biological characteristics of NK cells in the HCC environment are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine these cells' roles in tumorigenesis and prognosis. METHODS: We compared the single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of NK cells purified from blood (n = 1), healthy liver tissues (n = 3), HCC tumor tissues (n = 4), and peritumor liver tissues (n = 1) to identify NK cell subsets. Furthermore, we performed bioinformatics analysis by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to identify prognostic biomarkers simultaneously overexpressed in the blood and tumor tissues of patients with HCC. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed 5 NK cell subsets (L1-NK-CD56(bright), L2-NK-CD56(dim), L3-NK-HLA, L4-LrNK-FCGR3A, and L5-LrNK-XCL1) in the healthy liver tissues. However, the transitional L3 subset and the CXCR6(+)CD16(+) L4 subset with strong anti-tumor activity were absent in the HCC and peritumor liver tissues. Furthermore, 4 common prognosis-associated genes (RHOB, TALDO1, HLA-DPA1, and TKT) were significantly overexpressed in the paired tumor tissue and blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed 5 specific subsets of NK cells in healthy human liver tissues. However, only 3 of the 5 NK cell subsets were present in HCC and peritumor tissues. The cytotoxic NK cell subsets were absent in HCC tissues. Furthermore, we identified 4 potential non-invasive prognostic biomarkers in patients with HCC.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS). METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and compared with the common susceptibility genes. RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for SS. CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.
PURPOSE: Using a real-world database with matched genomic-transcriptomic molecular data, we sought to characterize the distinct molecular correlates underlying clinical differences between patients with young-onset pancreatic cancer (YOPC; younger than 50 years) and patients with average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC; 70 years and older). METHODS: We analyzed matched whole-transcriptome and DNA sequencing data from 2,430 patient samples (YOPC, n = 292; AOPC, n = 2,138) from the Caris Life Sciences database (Phoenix, AZ). Immune deconvolution was performed using the quanTIseq pipeline. Overall survival (OS) data were obtained from insurance claims (n = 4,928); Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for age- and molecularly defined cohorts. Significance was determined as FDR-corrected P values (Q) < .05. RESULTS: Patients with YOPC had higher proportions of mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability-high, BRCA2-mutant, and PALB2-mutant tumors compared with patients with AOPC, but fewer SMAD4-, RNF43-, CDKN2A-, and SF3B1-mutant tumors. Notably, patients with YOPC demonstrated significantly lower incidence of KRAS mutations compared with patients with AOPC (81.3% v 90.9%; Q = .004). In the KRAS wild-type subset (n = 227), YOPC tumors demonstrated fewer TP53 mutations and were more likely driven by NRG1 and MET fusions, whereas BRAF fusions were exclusively observed in patients with AOPC. Immune deconvolution revealed significant enrichment of natural killer cells, CD8(+) T cells, monocytes, and M2 macrophages in patients with YOPC relative to patients with AOPC, which corresponded with lower rates of HLA-DPA1 homozygosity. There was an association with improved OS in patients with YOPC compared with patients with AOPC with KRAS wild-type tumors (median, 16.2 [YOPC-KRAS(WT)] v 10.6 [AOPC-KRAS(WT)] months; P = .008) but not KRAS-mutant tumors (P = .084). CONCLUSION: In this large, real-world multiomic characterization of age-stratified molecular differences in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, YOPC is associated with a distinct molecular landscape that has prognostic and therapeutic implications.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have underlined the genetic susceptibility in the pathogenesis of palindromic rheumatism (PR), but the known PR loci only partially explain the disease's genetic background. We aimed to genetically identify PR by whole-exome sequencing (WES). METHODS: This multicenter prospective study was conducted in 10 Chinese specialized rheumatology centers between September 2015 and January 2020. WES was performed in 185 patients with PR and in 272 healthy controls. PR patients were divided into PR subgroups who were negative for anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA-) and positive for ACPA (ACPA+) according to ACPA titer (cutoff value 20 IU/liter). We conducted whole-exome association analysis for the WES data. We used HLA imputation to type HLA genes. In addition, we used the polygenic risk score to measure the genetic correlations between PR and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the genetic correlations between ACPA- PR and ACPA+ PR. RESULTS: Among 185 patients with PR enrolled in our study, 50 patients (27.02%) were ACPA+ and 135 PR patients (72.98%) were ACPA-. We identified 8 novel loci (in the ACPA- PR group: ZNF503, RPS6KL1, HOMER3, HLA-DRA; in the ACPA+ PR group: RPS6KL1, TNPO2, WASH2P, FANK1) and 3 HLA alleles (in the ACPA- PR group: HLA-DRB1*0803 and HLA-DQB1; in the ACPA+ PR group: HLA-DPA1*0401) that were associated with PR and that surpassed genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8) ). Furthermore, polygenic risk score analysis showed that PR and RA were not similar (R(2) < 0.025), whereas ACPA+ PR and ACPA- PR showed a moderate genetic correlation (0.38 < R(2) < 0.8). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the distinct genetic background between ACPA- and ACPA+ PR patients. Additionally, our findings strengthened that PR and RA were not genetically similar.

HLA-DPA1*02:102Q, a novel HLA class II allele detected by next-generation sequencing.
BACKGROUND: Studies in humans and mice using the expression of an X-linked gene or lineage tracing, respectively, have suggested that clones of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exist in human atherosclerotic lesions but are limited by either spatial resolution or translatability of the model. METHODS: Phenotypic clonality can be detected by X-chromosome inactivation patterns. We investigated whether clones of SMCs exist in unstable human atheroma using RNA in situ hybridization (BaseScope) to identify a naturally occurring 24-nucleotide deletion in the 3'UTR of the X-linked BGN (biglycan) gene, a proteoglycan highly expressed by SMCs. BGN-specific BaseScope probes were designed to target the wild-type or deletion mRNA. Three different coronary artery plaque types (erosion, rupture, and adaptive intimal thickening) were selected from heterozygous females for the deletion BGN. Hybridization of target RNA-specific probes was used to visualize the spatial distribution of mutants. A clonality index was calculated from the percentage of each probe in each region of interest. Spatial transcriptomics were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts within clonal and nonclonal regions. RESULTS: Less than one-half of regions of interest in the intimal plaque were considered clonal with the mean percent regions of interest with clonality higher in the intimal plaque than in the media. This was consistent for all plaque types. The relationship of the dominant clone in the intimal plaque and media showed significant concordance. In comparison with the nonclonal lesions, the regions with SMC clonality had lower expression of genes encoding cell growth suppressors such as CD74, SERF-2 (small EDRK-rich factor 2), CTSB (cathepsin B), and HLA-DPA1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1), among others. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach to examine clonality suggests atherosclerosis is primarily a disease of polyclonally and to a lesser extent clonally expanded SMCs and may have implications for the development of antiatherosclerotic therapies.
DPA1*01:03:01:57 and DPA1*02:01:01:29 differ by a single nucleotide from their closest references, DPA1*01:03:01:02 and DPA1*02:01:01:06.
OBJECTIVE: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterised by bile duct strictures and progressive liver disease, eventually requiring liver transplantation. Although the pathogenesis of PSC remains incompletely understood, strong associations with HLA-class II haplotypes have been described. As specific HLA-DP molecules can bind the activating NK-cell receptor NKp44, we investigated the role of HLA-DP/NKp44-interactions in PSC. DESIGN: Liver tissue, intrahepatic and peripheral blood lymphocytes of individuals with PSC and control individuals were characterised using flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses. HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 imputation and association analyses were performed in 3408 individuals with PSC and 34 213 controls. NK cell activation on NKp44/HLA-DP interactions was assessed in vitro using plate-bound HLA-DP molecules and HLA-DPB wildtype versus knock-out human cholangiocyte organoids. RESULTS: NKp44+NK cells were enriched in livers, and intrahepatic bile ducts of individuals with PSC showed higher expression of HLA-DP. HLA-DP haplotype analysis revealed a highly elevated PSC risk for HLA-DPA1*02:01~B1*01:01 (OR 1.99, p=6.7x10(-50)). Primary NKp44+NK cells exhibited significantly higher degranulation in response to plate-bound HLA-DPA1*02:01-DPB1*01:01 compared with control HLA-DP molecules, which were inhibited by anti-NKp44-blocking. Human cholangiocyte organoids expressing HLA-DPA1*02:01-DPB1*01:01 after IFN-gamma-exposure demonstrated significantly increased binding to NKp44-Fc constructs compared with unstimulated controls. Importantly, HLA-DPA1*02:01-DPB1*01:01-expressing organoids increased degranulation of NKp44+NK cells compared with HLA-DPB1-KO organoids. CONCLUSION: Our studies identify a novel PSC risk haplotype HLA-DP A1*02:01~DPB1*01:01 and provide clinical and functional data implicating NKp44+NK cells that recognise HLA-DPA1*02:01-DPB1*01:01 expressed on cholangiocytes in PSC pathogenesis.
BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP is an HLA class II molecule. Overexpression of HLA class II molecules in placental trophoblast cells may induce pregnancy loss. However, the association between HLA-DP and pregnancy loss remains unclear. HLA-DPA1 is an HLA-DP peptide chain. The objective of this study was to assess the association between HLA-DPA1 genetic polymorphism and anembryonic pregnancy, a type of early pregnancy loss, in the Chinese population. METHODS: A case-control study was designed to compare the frequencies of HLA-DPA1 gene polymorphisms in an anembryonic pregnancy group and a control group. Sixty-eight cases and 122 controls were recruited. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the correlation between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and anembryonic pregnancy susceptibility. MassARRAY high-throughput DNA analysis was used to analyze 19 HLA-DPA1 SNPs. To explore how HLA-DPA1 polymorphism could affect anembryonic pregnancy, HLA-DPA1 serum levels were analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: Homozygous typing of rs1431403 (CC and TT) significantly increased the risk of anembryonic pregnancy in the case group (OR(CC)  = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.50-6.53; OR(TT)  = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.31-6.66; OR(CC+TT)  = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.62-5.78). In samples with high HLA-DPA1 levels (>/=1,500 pg/ml), the homozygous rs1431403 genotypes (n(CC)  = 21, 43.8%; n(TT)  = 20, 57.1%) were observed more frequently than were heterozygous genotypes. CONCLUSION: HLA-DPA1 rs1431403 may be a risk factor for anembryonic pregnancy in the Chinese population. Homozygous rs1431403 genotypes (CC and TT) may increase the risk of anembryonic pregnancy by aberrantly increasing the HLA-DPA1 levels.
Four novel HLA Class II alleles, HLA-DPA1*01:03:01:68, -DPA1*01:03:01:71, -DQA1*02:01:01:06, and -DQB1*06:03:01:19, characterized in Spanish individuals.
HLA-DPA1*01:27 differs from DPA1*01:03:01:01 by a single non-synonymous nucleotide change in codon 15 (ACG > ATG).
HLA-DPA1*01:86 differs from DPA1*01:03:01:05 by a single nucleotide change in codon 94 (AAG>GAG).
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is influenced by both viral and host factors. In genome-wide association studies, the human leucocyte antigen HLA-DPA1 and related polymorphism rs3077 were found to be associated with susceptibility to and spontaneous clearance of HBV infection. Here, we evaluated the association between HLA-DPA1 mRNA expression and the risk of HBV infection. HLA-DPA1 and rs3077 polymorphisms were investigated in 169 patients with chronic HBV and 217 healthy controls (HCs) from Sichuan Han blood donors using sequence-based typing and meta-analysis for HLA-DPA1 alleles. HLA-DPA1 mRNA levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that HLA-DPA1 and rs3077 were associated with HBV infection in the Sichuan population. Rs3077T and DPA1*01:03 played protective roles in HBV infection, and rs3077C and DPA1*02:02 increased susceptibility to HBV infection. We found that the HLA-DPA1 mRNA expression was decreased in the CHB group; in particular, the 3077CT, 3077TT, DPA1*01:03 and DPA1*02:01 alleles showed a significant decrease. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that expression of HLA-DPA1 alleles and rs3077 affected the risk of HBV infection. Genotypes with lower HLA-DPA1 expression had a greater susceptibility to HBV infection. Thus, further independent studies are needed to strengthen the associations of these polymorphisms with susceptibility to and clearance of HBV infection in Chinese populations.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections may clear spontaneously or become chronic and run through different phases. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3077, rs9277535 and rs9277534 within the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DP gene have been found to be associated with HBV susceptibility and persistence in Asians. However, evidence for the influence of these variants in Caucasians has been limited so far. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of these polymorphisms on the outcome of HBV infections in a large Caucasian population. METHODS: In this case-control study, we retrospectively analysed 1111 Caucasian individuals, including 618 with chronic HBV infections (CHB), 239 with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance (SC) and 254 healthy controls (HC). The rs3077, rs9277535 and rs9277534 SNPs were genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction from blood samples and melting curve analysis. RESULTS: A significant difference in the allele distributions was observed only for the rs3077 SNP between the HC and the CHB group as well as between the SC and CHB groups. The rs3077-C allele was associated with a lower probability for spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in comparison with the rs3077-T allele (OR 0.704, 95% CI 0.509-0.974; P = 0.033). No association of the three SNPs with the stages of chronic HBV infection was found. CONCLUSION: This is the first study demonstrating an association of the rs3077-T allele with spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in Caucasians. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of HLA-DP variants in disease pathogenesis and their potential role for individualized disease management.
Type 1 narcolepsy, a disorder caused by a lack of hypocretin (orexin), is so strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II HLA-DQA1( *)01:02-DQB1( *)06:02 (DQ0602) that very few non-DQ0602 cases have been reported. A known triggering factor for narcolepsy is pandemic 2009 influenza H1N1, suggesting autoimmunity triggered by upper-airway infections. Additional effects of other HLA-DQ alleles have been reported consistently across multiple ethnic groups. Using over 3,000 case and 10,000 control individuals of European and Chinese background, we examined the effects of other HLA loci. After careful matching of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ in case and control individuals, we found strong protective effects of HLA-DPA1( *)01:03-DPB1( *)04:02 (DP0402; odds ratio [OR] = 0.51 [0.38-0.67], p = 1.01 x 10(-6)) and HLA-DPA1( *)01:03-DPB1( *)04:01 (DP0401; OR = 0.61 [0.47-0.80], p = 2.07 x 10(-4)) and predisposing effects of HLA-DPB1( *)05:01 in Asians (OR = 1.76 [1.34-2.31], p = 4.71 x 10(-05)). Similar effects were found by conditional analysis controlling for HLA-DR and HLA-DQ with DP0402 (OR = 0.45 [0.38-0.55] p = 8.99 x 10(-17)) and DP0501 (OR = 1.38 [1.18-1.61], p = 7.11 x 10(-5)). HLA-class-II-independent associations with HLA-A( *)11:01 (OR = 1.32 [1.13-1.54], p = 4.92 x 10(-4)), HLA-B( *)35:03 (OR = 1.96 [1.41-2.70], p = 5.14 x 10(-5)), and HLA-B( *)51:01 (OR = 1.49 [1.25-1.78], p = 1.09 x 10(-5)) were also seen across ethnic groups in the HLA class I region. These effects might reflect modulation of autoimmunity or indirect effects of HLA class I and HLA-DP alleles on response to viral infections such as that of influenza.
