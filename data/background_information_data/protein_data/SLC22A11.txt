High serum urate levels are the major risk factor for gout. URAT1, the primary transporter for urate absorption in the kidneys, is well known as an anti-hyperuricemia drug target. However, the clinical application of URAT1-targeted drugs is limited because of their low specificity and severe side effects. The lack of structural information impedes elucidation of the transport mechanism and the development of new drugs. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human URAT1(R477S), its complex with urate, and its closely related homolog OAT4. URAT1(R477S) and OAT4 exhibit major facilitator superfamily (MFS) folds with outward- and inward-open conformations, respectively. Structural comparison reveals a 30 degrees  rotation between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, supporting an alternating access mechanism. A conserved arginine (OAT4-Arg473/URAT1-Arg477) is found to be essential for chloride-mediated inhibition. The URAT1(R477S)-urate complex reveals the specificity of urate recognition. Taken together, our study promotes our understanding of the transport mechanism and substrate selection of URAT1.
Genetic variation in the SLC2A9 gene is a new genetic risk factor for low fractional excretion of uric acid, hyperuricemia, and gout. Its gene product, GLUT9, was previously known as a type II glucose/fructose transporter but is now known to function as a high-capacity uric acid transporter that is expressed in kidney, liver, and several other tissues. Follow-up meta-analyses, including one with data from 28,141 individuals, implicated a total of nine additional loci influencing serum urate concentrations, including six other membrane transporters (SLC17A1, SLC17A3, SLC22A11, SLC22A12, SLC16A9, and ABCG2). Variants in these genes together account for about 5% of the variance in serum urate, two-thirds of which is due to SLC2A9. Using these variants in 'Mendelian randomization' analyses provides a powerful means of dissecting the role of urate in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, where cause-and-effect influences are difficult to discern due to potential confounding. The results highlight the complex interplay of membrane transporters involved in urate metabolism. They also show how variants of weak effect identified by genome-wide association studies can still be important in identifying novel pathways, including a 'complexity' of new and potentially druggable targets for modifying urate transport.
To develop a superior diagnostic approach for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAC), the present study prospectively included 338 PAAC patients, 294 normal healthy volunteers (NHV), 122 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 100 patients with non-PAAC malignancies. In the identification phase, HuProt Human Proteome Microarray, comprising 21 065 proteins, was used to identify serum tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAbs) candidates differentiating PAAC (n = 30) from NHV (n = 30). A PAAC-focused array containing 165 differentially expressed TAAbs identified was subsequently adopted in the validation phase (n = 712) for specificity and sensitivities. The multivariate TAAbs signature for differentiation PAAC from controls (NHV + CP) identified five candidates, namely the IgG-type TAAbs against CLDN17, KCNN3, SLAMF7, SLC22A11 and OR51F2. Multivariate logistic performance model of y = (22.893 x CA19-9 + 0.68 x CLDN17 - 4.012) showed a significant better diagnostic accuracy than that of CA19-9 and CLDN17 in differentiating PAAC from controls (NHV + CP) (AUC = 0.97, 0.92 and 0.82, respectively, P-value < .0001). We further tested the autoantigen level of CLDN17 by ELISA in 82 sera samples from PAAC (n = 42), CP (n = 24) and NHV (n = 16). Similarly, the model showed superior diagnostic performance than that of CA19-9 and CLDN17 (AUC = 0.93, 0.83 and 0.81, respectively, P-value < .0001) in differentiating PAAC from controls. In conclusion, our study is the first to characterize the circulating TAAbs signatures in PAAC. The results showed that CLDN17 combined with CA19-9 provided potentially clinical value and may serve as noninvasive novel biomarkers for PAAC diagnosis.
The excretion and reabsorption of uric acid both to and from urine are tightly regulated by uric acid transporters. Metabolic syndrome conditions, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and insulin resistance, are believed to regulate the expression of uric acid transporters and decrease the excretion of uric acid. However, the mechanisms driving cholesterol impacts on uric acid transporters have been unknown. Here, we show that cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) upregulates the uric acid reabsorption transporter URAT1 encoded by SLC22A12 via estrogen receptors (ER). Transcriptional motif analysis showed that the SLC22A12 gene promoter has more estrogen response elements (EREs) than other uric acid reabsorption transporters such as SLC22A11 and SLC22A13, and 27HC-activated SLC22A12 gene promoter via ER through EREs. Furthermore, 27HC increased SLC22A12 gene expression in human kidney organoids. Our results suggest that in hypercholesterolemic conditions, elevated levels of 27HC derived from cholesterol induce URAT1/SLC22A12 expression to increase uric acid reabsorption, and thereby, could increase serum uric acid levels.
Genome-wide association studies that scan the genome for common genetic variants associated with phenotype have greatly advanced medical knowledge. Hyperuricemia is no exception, with 28 loci identified. However, genetic control of pathways determining gout in the presence of hyperuricemia is still poorly understood. Two important pathways determining hyperuricemia have been confirmed (renal and gut excretion of uric acid with glycolysis now firmly implicated). Major urate loci are SLC2A9 and ABCG2. Recent studies show that SLC2A9 is involved in renal and gut excretion of uric acid and is implicated in antioxidant defense. Although etiological variants at SLC2A9 are yet to be identified, it is clear that considerable genetic complexity exists at the SLC2A9 locus, with multiple statistically independent genetic variants and local epistatic interactions. The positions of implicated genetic variants within or near chromatin regions involved in transcriptional control suggest that this mechanism (rather than structural changes in SLC2A9) is important in regulating the activity of SLC2A9. ABCG2 is involved primarily in extra-renal uric acid under-excretion with the etiological variant influencing expression. At the other 26 loci, probable causal genes can be identified at three (PDZK1, SLC22A11, and INHBB) with strong candidates at a further 10 loci. Confirmation of the causal gene will require a combination of re-sequencing, trans-ancestral mapping, and correlation of genetic association data with expression data. As expected, the urate loci associate with gout, although inconsistent effect sizes for gout require investigation. Finally, there has been no genome-wide association study using clinically ascertained cases to investigate the causes of gout in the presence of hyperuricemia. In such a study, use of asymptomatic hyperurcemic controls would be expected to increase the ability to detect genetic associations with gout.
The organic anion transporter (OAT) family encoded by SLC22A mediates the absorption, distribution, and excretion of a diverse array of environmental toxins, and clinically important drugs, including anti-HIV therapeutics, anti-tumor drugs, antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, and anti-inflammatories, and therefore is critical for the survival of mammalian species. Several OATs have been identified: OAT1 (SLC22A6), OAT2 (SLC22A7), OAT3 (SLC22A8), OAT4 (SLC22A11), OAT5 (SLC22A19) OAT6 (SLC22A20) and URAT1 (SLC22A12). The expressions of these OATs have been detected in key organs such as kidney, liver, brain and placenta. OAT dysfunction in these organs may contribute to the renal, hepatic, neurological and fetal toxicity and diseases. In this review, we summarize, according to the work done by our laboratory as well as by others, the most updated molecular studies on these OAT members, especially on the aspect of their structure-function relationships. The functional roles of N-glycosylation, transmembrane domains and individual amino acids, cell surface assembly, as well as associating proteins will be discussed. In addition, we will show the recent analyses of coding region polymorphisms of OATs, which give us information on the genetic variants of OATs and their potential effects on OAT functions.
Membrane transporters play an essential role in the pharmacokinetics of drugs as they mediate exchanges between biological compartments. Tacrolimus is characterized by wide interpatient variability in terms of its pharmacokinetics that may in part be due to genetic factors. The pharmacogenetics of drug transporters is therefore a promising area to explore in the clinical pharmacology of tacrolimus. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently available data regarding the pharmacogenetics of membrane transporters that may be involved in the interindividual variability of the response to tacrolimus. Several genetic variants in genes coding for influx or efflux membrane transporters (e.g. ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC8, SLC30A8, SLCO1B1/3, SLC28A1, SLC22A11, and SLC28A3) have been associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics variability or the occurrence of toxicity; however, there is still a degree of controversy as to the impact of these variants in vivo and further investigations are needed to confirm these results in larger cohorts and to validate the relevance of such genetic biomarkers for personalization of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplantations. The relationship between transporter polymorphisms and the intracellular concentration of tacrolimus should also be further investigated. Finally, the main challenge could be elucidation of the interplay of biological mechanisms underlying genetic variations that alter the drug concentration or its clinical effect.
Genetic variations in urate transporters play a significant role in determining human urate levels and have been implicated in developing hyperuricemia or gout. Polymorphism in the key urate transporters, such as ABCG2, URAT1, or GLUT9 was well-documented in the literature. Therefore in this study, our objective was to determine the frequency and effect of rare nonsynonymous allelic variants of SLC22A11, SLC22A13, and SLC17A1 on urate transport. In a cohort of 150 Czech patients with primary hyperuricemia and gout, we examined all coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of SLC22A11, SLC22A13, and SLC17A1 using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. For comparison, we used a control group consisting of 115 normouricemic subjects. To examine the effects of the rare allelic nonsynonymous variants on the expression, intracellular processing, and urate transporter protein function, we performed a functional characterization using the HEK293A cell line, immunoblotting, fluorescent microscopy, and site directed mutagenesis for preparing variants in vitro. Variants p.V202M (rs201209258), p.R343L (rs75933978), and p.P519L (rs144573306) were identified in the SLC22A11 gene (OAT4 transporter); variants p.R16H (rs72542450), and p.R102H (rs113229654) in the SLC22A13 gene (OAT10 transporter); and the p.W75C variant in the SLC17A1 gene (NPT1 transporter). All variants minimally affected protein levels and cytoplasmic/plasma membrane localization. The functional in vitro assay revealed that contrary to the native proteins, variants p.P519L in OAT4 (p </= 0.05), p.R16H in OAT10 (p </= 0.05), and p.W75C in the NPT1 transporter (p </= 0.01) significantly limited urate transport activity. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of (1) the risk of urate transporter-related hyperuricemia/gout and (2) uric acid handling in the kidneys.
Gout is one of the most common inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricaemia, which is affected by both genetic factors and environmental factors. Early researches show that a few of rare monogenic mutations, such as PRPS1 and HPRT1 mutations, lead to abnormal purine anabolism and then cause hyperuricaemia and gout. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of susceptibility loci and/or candidate genes associated with hyperuricemia and gout. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9, SLC22A11, and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia, while their overexpression may increase the reabsorption of uric acid. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in ABCG2, SLC17A1, and SLC17A3 cause urate underexcretion of renal and intestinal. These variations leading to blood uric acid excretion disorder (excess reabsorption and underexcretion) are the main genetic factors affecting hyperuicemia and gout. Moreover, to some degree, inhibins-activins growth factor system, transcription factors, cytoskeleton and gene-environment interaction can also affect the level of blood uric acid. In addition, two risk genes, RFX3 and KCNQ1, which might impair immune response and lead to functional deficiency of beta cell were recently discovered to influence hyperuiceamia and gout in Han Chinese. This paper systematically reviews genetic studies on hyperuricaemia and gout to improve our understanding of pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia and gout.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Uric acid homeostasis in the body is mediated by a number of SLC and ABC transporters in the kidney and intestine, including several multispecific 'drug' transporters (e.g., OAT1, OAT3, and ABCG2). Optimization of uric acid levels can be viewed as a 'systems biology' problem. Here, we consider uric acid transporters from a systems physiology perspective using the framework of the 'Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis.' This hypothesis explains how SLC and ABC 'drug' and other transporters mediate interorgan and interorganismal communication (e.g., gut microbiome and host) via small molecules (e.g., metabolites, antioxidants signaling molecules) through transporters expressed in tissues lining body fluid compartments (e.g., blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid). RECENT FINDINGS: The list of uric acid transporters includes: SLC2A9, ABCG2, URAT1 (SLC22A12), OAT1 (SLC22A6), OAT3 (SLC22A8), OAT4 (SLC22A11), OAT10 (SLC22A13), NPT1 (SLC17A1), NPT4 (SLC17A3), MRP2 (ABCC2), MRP4 (ABCC4). Normally, SLC2A9, - along with URAT1, OAT1 and OAT3, - appear to be the main transporters regulating renal urate handling, while ABCG2 appears to regulate intestinal transport. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), intestinal ABCG2 becomes much more important, suggesting remote organ communication between the injured kidney and the intestine. SUMMARY: The remote sensing and signaling hypothesis provides a useful systems-level framework for understanding the complex interplay of uric acid transporters expressed in different tissues involved in optimizing uric acid levels under normal and diseased (e.g., CKD, gut microflora dysbiosis) conditions.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health concern affecting millions worldwide. One of the critical challenges in CKD is the accumulation of uremic toxins such as p-cresol sulfate (pCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS), which contribute to systemic damage and CKD progression. Understanding the transport mechanisms of these prominent toxins is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, we investigated whether pCS and IS are routed to the plasma membrane or to the cytosol by two key transporters, SLC22A11 and OAT1. To distinguish between cytosolic transport and plasma membrane insertion, we used a hyperosmolarity assay in which the accumulation of substrates into HEK-293 cells in isotonic and hypertonic buffers was measured in parallel using LC-MS/MS. Judging from the efficiency of transport (TE), pCS is a relevant substrate of SLC22A11 at 7.8 +/- 1.4 microL min(-1) mg protein(-1) but not as good as estrone-3-sulfate; OAT1 translocates pCS less efficiently. The TE of SLC22A11 for IS was similar to pCS. For OAT1, however, IS is an excellent substrate. With OAT1 and p-aminohippuric acid, our study revealed an influence of transporter abundance on the outcomes of the hyperosmolarity assay; very high transport activity confounded results. SLC22A11 was found to insert both pCS and IS into the plasma membrane, whereas OAT1 conveys these toxins to the cytosol. These disparate transport mechanisms bear profound ramifications for toxicity. Membrane insertion might promote membrane damage and microvesicle release. Our results underscore the imperative for detailed structural inquiries into the translocation of small molecules.
OBJECTIVES: To perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of gout cases versus asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (AH) controls, and gout cases versus normouricaemia controls, and to generate a polygenic risk score (PRS) to determine gout-case versus AH-control status. METHODS: Gout cases and AH controls (serum urate (SU) >/=6.0 mg/dL) from the UK Biobank were divided into discovery (4934 cases, 56 948 controls) and replication (2115 cases, 24 406 controls) cohorts. GWAS was conducted and PRS generated using summary statistics in discovery cohort as the base dataset and the replication cohort as the target dataset. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated. GWAS were performed to identify variants associated with gout compared with normouricaemic controls using SU <6.0 mg/dL and <7.0 mg/dL thresholds, respectively. RESULTS: Thirteen independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCG2, SLC2A9, SLC22A11, GCKR, MEPE, PPM1K-DT, LOC105377323 and ADH1B reached genome-wide significance and replicated as predictors of AH to gout transition. Twelve of 13 associations were novel for this transition, and rs1229984 (ADH1B) was identified as GWAS locus for gout for the first time. The best PRS model was generated from association data of 17 SNPs; and had predictive ability of 58.5% that increased to 69.2% on including demographic factors. Two novel SNPs rs760077(MTX1) and rs3800307(PRSS16) achieved GWAS significance for association with gout compared with normouricaemic controls using both SU thresholds. CONCLUSION: The association of urate transporters with gout supports the central role of hyperuricaemia in its pathogenesis. Larger GWAS are required to identify if variants in inflammatory pathways contribute to progression from AH to gout.
Several SLC22 transporters in the human kidney and other tissues are thought to regulate endogenous small antioxidant molecules such as uric acid, ergothioneine, carnitine, and carnitine derivatives. These transporters include those from the organic anion transporter (OAT), OCTN/OCTN-related, and organic cation transporter (OCT) subgroups. In mammals, it has been difficult to show a clear in vivo role for these transporters during oxidative stress. Ubiquitous knockdowns of related Drosophila SLC22s-including transporters homologous to those previously identified by us in mammals such as the "Fly-Like Putative Transporters" FLIPT1 (SLC22A15) and FLIPT2 (SLC22A16)-have shown modest protection against oxidative stress. However, these fly transporters tend to be broadly expressed, and it is unclear if there is an organ in which their expression is critical. Using two tissue-selective knockdown strategies, we were able to demonstrate much greater and longer protection from oxidative stress compared to previous whole fly knockdowns as well as both parent and WT strains (CG6126: p < 0.001, CG4630: p < 0.01, CG16727: p < 0.0001 and CG6006: p < 0.01). Expression in the Malpighian tubule and likely other tissues as well (e.g., gut, fat body, nervous system) appear critical for managing oxidative stress. These four Drosophila SLC22 genes are similar to human SLC22 transporters (CG6126: SLC22A16, CG16727: SLC22A7, CG4630: SLC22A3, and CG6006: SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC22A6, SLC22A7, SLC22A8, SLC22A11, SLC22A12 (URAT1), SLC22A13, SLC22A14)-many of which are highly expressed in the kidney. Consistent with the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory, this indicates an important in vivo role in the oxidative stress response for multiple SLC22 transporters within the fly renal system, perhaps through interaction with SLC22 counterparts in non-renal tissues. We also note that many of the human relatives are well-known drug transporters. Our work not only indicates the importance of SLC22 transporters in the fly renal system but also sets the stage for in vivo studies by examining their role in mammalian oxidative stress and organ crosstalk.
&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; The medicinal herb &lt;i&gt;Plumbago indica&lt;/i&gt; (PI) and its major constituent plumbagin have reported pharmacological properties but there is a lack of information about their herb-drug interactions. The effects of methanolic (PI-MeOH) and ethanolic (PI-EtOH) crude extracts of PI and plumbagin on the expression of cytochrome P450s (&lt;i&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CYP2E1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CYP3A4&lt;/i&gt;) and transporters (&lt;i&gt;ABCC1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ABCG2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SLC22A11&lt;/i&gt;) were investigated in BeWo and HepG2 cells. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; BeWo or HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5-5 muM plumbagin or 25-500 mug mL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of PI-MeOH or PI-EtOH for 24 hrs. Total RNA was extracted and mRNA expression of CYPs and transporters were determined using RT-qPCR. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; PI and plumbagin affected mRNA expression differently in the two tested cell types. In BeWo cells, all concentrations of PI-MeOH induced &lt;i&gt;CYP2E1&lt;/i&gt;, 100 and 500 mug Ml&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; PI-MeOH and PI-EtOH up-regulated &lt;i&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CYP3A4 &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;ABCG2 &lt;/i&gt;and 500 mug mL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; PI-EtOH induced &lt;i&gt;ABCG2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Plumbagin suppressed &lt;i&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/i&gt; and induced &lt;i&gt;SLC22A11 &lt;/i&gt;expression at the highest concentration, 5 muM. In HepG2 cells, 5 muM plumbagin and 500 mug Ml&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; PI-EtOH suppressed &lt;i&gt;CYP3A4 &lt;/i&gt;expression and 500 mug mL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; PI-MeOH and PI-EtOH up-regulated &lt;i&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CYP2E1 &lt;/i&gt;expression. &lt;i&gt;ABCC1&lt;/i&gt; expression was induced by all treatments while &lt;i&gt;ABCG2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SLC22A11 &lt;/i&gt;were induced only by 500 mug mL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; PI-MeOH and PI-EtOH. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The use of PI or plumbagin supplements in large quantities or for long periods should be carefully considered due to the risk of herbal drug interactions via modulated expression of CYPs and transporters.
BACKGROUND: Anti-resorptive bisphosphonates (BP) are used for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases. Clinical studies indicated a benefit in survival and tumor relapse in subpopulations of breast cancer patients receiving zoledronic acid, thus stimulating the debate about its anti-tumor activity. Amino-bisphosphonates in nM concentrations inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase leading to accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and the ATP/pyrophosphate adduct ApppI, which induces apoptosis in osteoclasts. For anti-tumor effects muM concentrations are needed and a sensitizer for bisphosphonate effects would be beneficial in clinical anti-tumor applications. We hypothesized that enhancing intracellular pyrophosphate accumulation via inhibition of probenecid-sensitive channels and transporters would sensitize tumor cells for bisphosphonates anti-tumor efficacy. METHOD: MDA-MB-231, T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with BP (zoledronic acid, risedronate, ibandronate, alendronate) and the pyrophosphate channel inhibitors probenecid and novobiocin. We determined cell viability and caspase 3/7 activity (apoptosis), accumulation of IPP and ApppI, expression of ANKH, PANX1, ABCC1, SLC22A11, and the zoledronic acid target gene and tumor-suppressor KLF2. RESULTS: Treatment of MDA-MB-231 with BP induced caspase 3/7 activity, with zoledronic acid being the most effective. In MCF-7 and T47D either BP markedly suppressed cell viability with only minor effects on apoptosis. Co-treatment with probenecid enhanced BP effects on cell viability, IPP/ApppI accumulation as measurable in MCF-7 and T47D cells, caspase 3/7 activity and target gene expression. Novobiocin co-treatment of MDA-MB-231 yielded identical results on viability and apoptosis compared to probenecid, rendering SLC22A family members as candidate modulators of BP effects, whereas no such evidence was found for ANKH, ABCC1 and PANX1. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate effects of various bisphosphonates on caspase 3/7 activity, cell viability and expression of tumor suppressor genes in breast cancer cells. Blocking probenecid and novobiocin-sensitive channels and transporters enhances BP anti-tumor effects and renders SLC22A family members as good candidates as BP modulators. Further studies will have to unravel if treatment with such BP-sensitizers translates into preclinical and clinical efficacy.
The genetic determinants of the allopurinol dose-concentration relationship have not been extensively studied. We aimed to clarify what factors, including genetic variation in urate transporters, influence oxypurinol pharmacokinetics (PKs). A population PK model for oxypurinol was developed with NONMEM (version 7.3). The influence of urate transporter genetic variants for ABCG2 (rs2231142 and rs10011796), SLC2A9/GLUT9 (rs11942223), SLC17A1/NPT1 (rs1183201), SLC22A12/URAT1 (rs3825018), SLC22A11/OAT4 (rs17300741), and ABCC4/MRP4 (rs4148500), as well as other participant factors on oxypurinol PKs was assessed. Data from 325 people with gout were available. The presence of the T allele for ABCG2 (rs2231142) and SLC17A1/NPT1 (rs1183201) was associated with a 24% and 22% increase in oxypurinol clearance, respectively, in univariate analysis. This effect was not significant in the multivariate analysis. In the final model, oxypurinol PKs were predicted by creatinine clearance, diuretic use, ethnicity, and body weight. We have found that genetic variability in the transporters examined does not appear to influence oxypurinol PKs.
BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be used as predictors of patients' therapeutic outcome variability. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the influence of SNPs in genes encoding for MTX membrane transport proteins in order to predict clinical response to MTX. METHODS: Clinicopathological data from 233 RA patients treated with MTX were collected, clinical response defined, and patients genotyped for 23 SNPs. Genotype and haplotype analyses were performed using multivariate methods and a genetic risk index (GRI) for non-response was created. RESULTS: Increased risk for non-response was associated to SLC22A11 rs11231809 T carriers; ABCC1 rs246240 G carriers; ABCC1 rs3784864 G carriers; CGG haplotype for ABCC1 rs35592, rs2074087 and rs3784864; and CGG haplotype for ABCC1 rs35592, rs246240 and rs3784864. GRI demonstrated that patients with Index 3 were 16-fold more likely to be non-responders than those with Index 1. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that SLC22A11 and ABCC1 may be important to identify those patients who will not benefit from MTX treatment, highlighting the relevance in translating these results to clinical practice. However, further validation by independent studies is needed to develop the field of personalized medicine to predict clinical response to MTX treatment.
Obesity, a risk factor for multiple diseases (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cancers) originates through complex interactions between genes and prevailing environment (food habit and lifestyle) that varies across populations. Indians exhibit a unique obesity phenotype with high abdominal adiposity for a given body weight compared to matched white populations suggesting presence of population-specific genetic and environmental factors influencing obesity. However, Indian population-specific genetic contributors for obesity have not been explored yet. Therefore, to identify potential genetic contributors, we performed a two-staged genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body mass index (BMI), a common measure to evaluate obesity in 5973 Indian adults and the lead findings were further replicated in 1286 Indian adolescents. Our study revealed novel association of variants-rs6913677 in BAI3 gene (p = 1.08 x 10(-8)) and rs2078267 in SLC22A11 gene (p = 4.62 x 10(-8)) at GWAS significance, and of rs8100011 in ZNF45 gene (p = 1.04 x 10(-7)) with near GWAS significance. As genetic loci may dictate the phenotype through modulation of epigenetic processes, we overlapped genetic data of identified signals with their DNA methylation patterns in 236 Indian individuals and performed methylation quantitative trait loci (meth-QTL) analysis. Further, functional roles of discovered variants and underlying genes were speculated using publicly available gene regulatory databases (ENCODE, JASPAR, GeneHancer, GTEx). The identified variants in BAI3 and SLC22A11 genes were found to dictate methylation patterns at unique CpGs harboring critical cis-regulatory elements. Further, BAI3, SLC22A11 and ZNF45 variants were located in repressive chromatin, active enhancer, and active chromatin regions, respectively, in human subcutaneous adipose tissue in ENCODE database. Additionally, these genomic regions represented potential binding sites for key transcription factors implicated in obesity and/or metabolic disorders. Interestingly, GTEx portal identify rs8100011 as a robust cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 1.6 x 10(-7)), and ZNF45 gene expression in skeletal muscle of Indian subjects showed an inverse correlation with BMI indicating its possible role in obesity. In conclusion, our study discovered 3 novel population-specific functional genetic variants (rs6913677, rs2078267, rs8100011) in 2 novel (SLC22A11 and ZNF45) and 1 earlier reported gene (BAI3) for BMI in Indians. Our study decodes key genomic loci underlying obesity phenotype in Indians that may serve as prospective drug targets in future.
Many drugs are largely hydrophobic molecules; a transporter might conceivably insert these into the plasma membrane. At least 18 transporters from diverse families have been reported to transport the model compound estrone sulfate alias estrone-3-sulfate (E3S). Out of these, we recently examined SLC22A11 (OAT4). We concluded from a comparison of E3S and uric acid transport that SLC22A11 does not translocate E3S into the cytosol, but into the plasma membrane. Here we present a hyperosmolarity alias hypertonicity assay to differentiate transport mechanisms. Human transporters were expressed heterologously in 293 cells. Solute uptake into intact cells was measured by LC-MS. Addition of mannitol or sucrose led to rapid cell shrinkage, but cell viability after 60 min in hyperosmolar buffer was not impaired. A decrease in substrate accumulation with increasing osmolarity as observed here for several substrates and the transporters SLC22A11, ETT (SLC22A4), OCT2 (SLC22A2), OAT3 (SLC22A8), and MATE1 (SLC47A1) suggests regular substrate translocation into the cytosol. An increase as observed for E3S transport by SLC22A11, OAT3, MATE1, SLC22A9, and SLC10A6 implies insertion into the membrane. In marked contrast to the other E3S transporters, the bile acid transporter SLC10A1 (NTCP, Na(+) taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide) showed a decrease in the accumulation of E3S in hyperosmolar buffer; the same was observed with taurocholic acid. Indeed, our data from several functional assays strongly suggest that the transport mechanism is identical for both substrates. Apparently, a unique transport mechanism has been established for SLC10A1 by evolution that ensures the transport of amphipathic, detergent-like molecules into the cytosol.
