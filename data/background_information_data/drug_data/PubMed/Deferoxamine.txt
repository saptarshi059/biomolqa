Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death, which is different from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and other forms of cell death. The process of ferroptotic cell death is defined by the accumulation of lethal lipid species derived from the peroxidation of lipids, which can be prevented by iron chelators (e.g., deferiprone, deferoxamine) and small lipophilic antioxidants (e.g., ferrostatin, liproxstatin). This review summarizes current knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis and its association with several pathways, including iron, lipid, and cysteine metabolism. We have further discussed the contribution of ferroptosis to the pathogenesis of several diseases such as cancer, ischemia/reperfusion, and various neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), and evaluated the therapeutic applications of ferroptosis inhibitors in clinics.
Iron-chelating therapy with deferoxamine in patients with thalassemia major has dramatically altered the prognosis of this previously fatal disease. The successes achieved with deferoxamine, as well as the limitations of this treatment, have stimulated the design of alternative strategies of iron-chelating therapy, including orally active iron chelators. The development of the most promising of these, deferiprone, has progressed rapidly over the last 5 years; data from several trials have provided direct and supportive evidence for its short-term efficacy. At the same time, the toxicity of this agent mandates a careful evaluation of the balance between risk and benefit of deferiprone in patients with thalassemia, in most of whom long-term deferoxamine is safe and efficacious therapy.
The fact that corticosteroids, phenothiazines and myotics induce cataract is well known. Moreover some informations about lens opacities have been reported less frequently after the use of cytostatics, deferoxamine, phenytoine, isotretinoine, oral contraceptives, allopurinol, synthetics antimalarial agents, diazepam, tetracyclines and sulfamides. Occasionally some others drugs have been suspected from experimental observations to produce cataract. Amongst all these drugs, corticosteroids are the most often incriminated.
Accidental ingestion of iron-containing preparations is a common, serious pediatric problem. Despite the frequency of this type of ingestion, the treatment remains under dispute. Controversies surrounding the use of sodium bicarbonate and phosphate solutions for complexation, oral deferoxamine lavage, and the deferoxamine provocation test are discussed. Therapeutic recommendations are made based on a review of the literature.
Deferoxamine (DFO) represents a widely used iron chelator for the treatment of iron overload. Here we describe the use of mitochondrially targeted deferoxamine (mitoDFO) as a novel approach to preferentially target cancer cells. The agent showed marked cytostatic, cytotoxic, and migrastatic properties in vitro, and it significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The underlying molecular mechanisms included (i) impairment of iron-sulfur [Fe-S] cluster/heme biogenesis, leading to destabilization and loss of activity of [Fe-S] cluster/heme containing enzymes, (ii) inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leading to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, resulting in dysfunctional mitochondria with markedly reduced supercomplexes, and (iii) fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and induction of mitophagy. Mitochondrial targeting of deferoxamine represents a way to deprive cancer cells of biologically active iron, which is incompatible with their proliferation and invasion, without disrupting systemic iron metabolism. Our findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial iron metabolism for cancer cells and demonstrate repurposing deferoxamine into an effective anticancer drug via mitochondrial targeting. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that targeting the iron chelator deferoxamine to mitochondria impairs mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis of [Fe-S] clusters/heme in cancer cells, which suppresses proliferation and migration and induces cell death.
