Duloxetine, a potent reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine, is effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain, stress urinary incontinence, generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia. Duloxetine achieves a maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of approximately 47 ng/mL (40 mg twice-daily dosing) to 110 ng/mL (80 mg twice-daily dosing) approximately 6 hours after dosing. The elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 10-12 hours and the volume of distribution is approximately 1640 L. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine with a focus on concomitant medications and their clinical implications. Patient demographic characteristics found to influence the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine include sex, smoking status, age, ethnicity, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype, hepatic function and renal function. Of these, only impaired hepatic function or severely impaired renal function warrant specific warnings or dose recommendations. Pharmacokinetic results from drug interaction studies show that activated charcoal decreases duloxetine exposure, and that CYP1A2 inhibition increases duloxetine exposure to a clinically significant degree. Specifically, following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and C(max) of duloxetine significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In addition, smoking is associated with a 30% decrease in duloxetine concentration. The exposure of duloxetine with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is increased to a lesser extent than that observed with CYP1A2 inhibition and does not require a dose adjustment. In addition, duloxetine increases the exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, but not CYP1A2. Pharmacodynamic study results indicate that duloxetine may enhance the effects of benzodiazepines, but not alcohol or warfarin. An increase in gastric pH produced by histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists or antacids did not impact the absorption of duloxetine. While duloxetine is generally well tolerated, it is important to be knowledgeable about the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between duloxetine and drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 or drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes.
INTRODUCTION: Duloxetine has previously been reported to be promising in the setting of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, on the use of duloxetine in prevention and treatment of CIPN. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from database inception up until April 2022. Articles were included in this review if they reported on duloxetine use in the setting of CIPN, in a multiarm comparative human trial. A random effects DerSimonian-Laird model was used to calculate summary risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% CIs, comparing duloxetine to placebo. This review was registered on. RESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials that included 645 patients were identified. Five reported on duloxetine for treatment of CIPN, and two for prevention of CIPN. Two studies had some concern for bias. Duloxetine was statistically similar to placebo in its efficacy, both in the treatment (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01) and prevention (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19) of CIPN. Safety profile was similar, in the treatment (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.89) and prevention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.38) setting. CONCLUSION: There is currently limited evidence supporting duloxetine's use for CIPN. There is a need for more comprehensive and higher-quality trials assessing duloxetine in the setting of CIPN, before further clinical practice recommendations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO (CRD42022327487).
IMPORTANCE: There are no known effective treatments for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of duloxetine, 60 mg daily, on average pain severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial at 8 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded cooperative research networks that enrolled 231 patients who were 25 years or older being treated at community and academic settings between April 2008 and March 2011. Study follow-up was completed July 2012. Stratified by chemotherapeutic drug and comorbid pain risk, patients were randomized to receive either duloxetine followed by placebo or placebo followed by duloxetine. Eligibility required that patients have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, representing average chemotherapy-induced pain, after paclitaxel, other taxane, or oxaliplatin treatment. INTERVENTIONS: The initial treatment consisted of taking 1 capsule daily of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo for the first week and 2 capsules of either 30 mg of duloxetine or placebo daily for 4 additional weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary hypothesis was that duloxetine would be more effective than placebo in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain. Pain severity was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form "average pain" item with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing as bad as can be imagined. RESULTS: Individuals receiving duloxetine as their initial 5-week treatment reported a mean decrease in average pain of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.72-1.40) vs 0.34 (95% CI, 0.01-0.66) among those who received placebo (P = .003; effect size, 0.513). The observed mean difference in the average pain score between duloxetine and placebo was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.26-1.20). Fifty-nine percent of those initially receiving duloxetine vs 38% of those initially receiving placebo reported decreased pain of any amount. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, the use of duloxetine compared with placebo for 5 weeks resulted in a greater reduction in pain.

INTRODUCTION: The optimal dose of duloxetine in the management of fibromyalgia remains still controversial. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate efficacy and safety of duloxetine was conducted. The outcomes of interests were to assess changes in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The rate of of adverse events and those leading to therapy discontinuation were also investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study followed the 2020 PRISMA guidelines. The literature search started in December 2022 accessing PubMed, Google scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. All the RCTs investigating the efficacy and safety of daily administration of duloxetine for fibromyalgia were accessed. Studies reporting quantitative data under the outcomes of interest, and including a minimum of 10 patients who completed a minimum of 4 weeks follow-up, were included. Studies on combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological managements for fibromyalgia were not considered. RESULTS: Data from 3432 patients (11 RCTs) were included. The mean age of the patients was 46.4 +/- 10.7 years old, and the mean BMI 25.3 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2). 90% (3089 of 3432 patients) were women. The 60 mg/daily cohort reported the higher FIQ, followed by the 30, 30-60, 120 mg/daily, and placebo groups, while the 60-120 mg /daily group performed the worst results. Concerning the CGI severity scale, placebo resulted in the lowest improvement, and no differences were found in the other groups. Concerning the BPI interference and severity pain scores, the 30-60 mg/daily group reported the worst result, along with the placebo group. The rate of adverse events leading to study discontinuation were lower in the 60-120 group, followed by the 30-60 and 30 mag/daily groups. Duloxetine was superior in all the comparisons to placebo, irrespective of the doses, in all endpoints analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Duloxetine could help in improving symptoms of fibromyalgia. The dose of duloxetine should be customised according to individual patients. Irrespective of the doses, duloxetine was more effective than placebo in the management of fibromyalgia. The dose of duloxetine must be customised according to individual patients. Level of evidence I Meta-analysis of double-blind RCTs.
