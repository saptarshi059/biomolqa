Loop diuretics are among the most widely used drugs worldwide and are commonly employed in the management of complications associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), namely volume overload and electrolyte management. The use of loop diuretics in critically ill patients with AKI is paramount to preventing or treating pulmonary edema. The naturetic response to a loop diuretic is based on its unique renal pharmacology. Our review article summarizes the pharmacology of furosemide in the intact nephron and discusses how this response might be altered by the presence of AKI. We discuss the increasing body of literature on the latest clinical utility of furosemide namely, it's challenge test, known as the furosemide stress test which has highlighted a new and novel role for furosemide over the past number of years. This test assists with the identification of AKI subjects at higher risk of AKI progression and the need for renal replacement therapy. The stress test can also predict cessation of continuous renal replacement therapy in patients with established AKI. On the basis of the evidence presented in this review, we propose future potential studies of furosemide in AKI.
Furosemide (frusemide) is a potent loop diuretic used in the treatment of oedematous states associated with cardiac, renal and hepatic failure, and for the treatment of hypertension. Therapy is frequently complicated by apparently erratic systemic availability from the oral route and from unpredictable responses to a given dosage. The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but furosemide is believed to act at the luminal surface of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle by inhibiting the active reabsorption of chloride. The response to a given dosage is modulated by the fluid and electrolyte balance of the individual. Acute and delayed tolerance has been demonstrated both in animals and in man, and is postulated to be due to the intervention of homeostatic mechanisms influencing fluid and electrolyte balances. Furosemide is delivered to its site of action by active secretion via the nonspecific organic acid pump. Comparisons between the observed diuresis/saluresis and plasma furosemide concentrations, urinary excretion rates and renal clearance found either negative or no correlations with plasma drug concentration but significant correlations with urine measurements. Response is related to the concentration of the drug in urine rather than in plasma. The most common adverse reactions attributable to furosemide therapy are essentially extensions of the therapeutic effects (i.e. fluid and electrolyte disturbances). The pharmacokinetic behaviour of furosemide is marked by a large degree of variability, derived from differences within and between both subjects and study protocols. Part of this variability can be attributed to differences in organ function, which is important in view of the types of patients treated with furosemide. On the other hand, a large proportion remains as inter- and intrasubject variation. The bioavailability of furosemide from oral dosage forms is highly variable. The poor bioavailability has been hypothesized to be due to the poor solubility of the compound, site-specific absorption, presystemic metabolism and/or other unknown mechanisms. Furosemide is highly bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively to albumin. Although the drug is insoluble in water and favours partitioning into fatty tissue, the high degree of plasma protein binding restricts the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state to values within a multiple of 2 to 5 times the plasma volume. Furosemide has two documented metabolites--furosemide glucuronide and saluamine (CSA). The first is an accepted metabolic product, whereas the status of CSA as a metabolite is highly controversial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
BACKGROUND: It has been a matter of much debate whether the co-administration of furosemide and albumin can achieve better diuresis and natriuresis than furosemide treatment alone. There is inconsistency in published trials regarding the effect of this combination therapy. We, therefore, conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of furosemide and albumin co-administration and the factors potentially influencing the diuretic effect of such co-administration. METHODS: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched the PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases. Prospective studies with adult populations which comparing the effect of furosemide and albumin co-administration with furosemide alone were included. The outcomes including diuretic effect and natriuresis effect measured by hourly urine output and hourly urine sodium excretion from both groups were extracted. Random effect model was applied for conducting meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity of treatment effects. RESULTS: By including 13 studies with 422 participants, the meta-analysis revealed that furosemide with albumin co-administration increased urine output by 31.45 ml/hour and increased urine excretion by 1.76 mEq/hour in comparison to furosemide treatment alone. The diuretic effect of albumin and furosemide co-administration was better in participants with low baseline serum albumin levels (< 2.5 g/dL) and high prescribed albumin infusion doses (> 30 g), and the effect was more significant within 12 hours after administration. Diuretic effect of co-administration was better in those with baseline Cr > 1.2 mg/dL and natriuresis effect of co-administration was better in those with baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. CONCLUSION: Co-administration of furosemide with albumin might enhance diuresis and natriuresis effects than furosemide treatment alone but with high heterogeneity in treatment response. According to the present meta-analysis, combination therapy might provide advantages compared to the furosemide therapy alone in patients with baseline albumin levels lower than 2.5 g/dL or in patients receiving higher albumin infusion doses or in patients with impaired renal function. Owing to high heterogeneity and limited enrolled participants, further parallel randomized controlled trials are warranted to examine our outcome.

Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is frequently used in different stages of acute kidney injury, but its clinical roles remain uncertain. This review summarises the pharmacology of furosemide, its potential uses and side effects, and the evidence of its efficacy. Furosemide is actively secreted by the proximal tubules into the urine before reaching its site of action at the ascending limb of loop of Henle. It is the urinary concentrations of furosemide that determine its diuretic effect. The severity of acute kidney injury has a significant effect on the diuretic response to furosemide; a good 'urinary response' may be considered as a 'proxy' for having some residual renal function. The current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. In patients with acute lung injury without haemodynamic instability, furosemide may be useful in achieving fluid balance to facilitate mechanical ventilation according to the lung-protective ventilation strategy.
A new delivery mechanism provides subcutaneous infusion of furosemide to treat fluid overload in adults with heart failure.
