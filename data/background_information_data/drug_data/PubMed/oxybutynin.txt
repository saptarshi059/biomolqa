Primary hyperhidrosis commonly affects the axillae, palms, soles, scalp, face, and groin. Patients may have multiple areas involved making localized therapy challenging. Systemic therapy may be necessary and can be used as monotherapy or combined with other hyperhidrosis treatments for optimal outcomes. Systemic therapy can also be used to treat secondary hyperhidrosis and compensatory hyperhidrosis.
A 5-year-old girl with previously unrecognized hyperopia of approximately +3.00 D developed esotropia while being treated with oxybutynin for enuresis. The esotropia disappeared with cessation of oxybutynin and correction of her hyperopia. When the hyperopic correction was removed, she had a small esophoria. The esotropia was presumably triggered by the anticholinergic effect of oxybutynin, which reduced the ability to accommodate. The increased accommodative effort for vision generated an esotropia as a result of the accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio.
Sepracor is developing (S)-oxybutynin, a single-isomer version of Alza's Ditropan (racemic oxybutynin), a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, as a potential treatment for urinary incontinence.
*Oxybutynin inhibits contraction of the detrusor muscle in the overactive bladder by binding to muscarinic M(3) receptors and blocking acetylcholinergic activation. *The transdermal oxybutynin system, applied twice weekly, delivers continuous oxybutynin over a 96-hour patch wear period. The transdermal route of administration avoids the extensive first-pass metabolism of oxybutynin to its active metabolite, N-desethyloxybutynin. *In two well designed trials in patients with overactive bladder, transdermal oxybutynin 3.9 mg/day decreased the number of incontinence episodes and increased average voided volume to a significantly greater extent than placebo. Urinary frequency was improved to a significantly greater extent with transdermal oxybutynin than with placebo in one trial but not the other. *There was no significant difference between transdermal oxybutynin and extended-release oral tolterodine for any of these endpoints. *Health-related quality-of-life improvements with transdermal oxybutynin were shown in patients with overactive bladder in the open-label MATRIX trial, as demonstrated by significant improvements in all domains of the King's Health Questionnaire. *Transdermal oxybutynin is generally well tolerated in patients with overactive bladder. The majority of patients who discontinued transdermal oxybutynin treatment in two pivotal trials did so because of application-site reactions. However, none discontinued treatment because of dry mouth.
Rationale: There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recent investigations indicate that drugs with noradrenergic and antimuscarinic effects improve genioglossus muscle activity and upper airway patency during sleep. Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of the combination of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine) and an antimuscarinic (oxybutynin) on OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]; primary outcome) and genioglossus responsiveness (secondary outcome) in people with OSA. Methods: A total of 20 people completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial comparing 1 night of 80 mg atomoxetine plus 5 mg oxybutynin (ato-oxy) to placebo administered before sleep. The AHI and genioglossus muscle responsiveness to negative esophageal pressure swings were measured via in-laboratory polysomnography. In a subgroup of nine patients, the AHI was also measured when the drugs were administered separately. Measurements and Main Results: The participants' median (interquartile range) age was 53 (46-58) years and body mass index was 34.8 (30.0-40.2) kg/m(2). ato-oxy lowered AHI by 63% (34-86%), from 28.5 (10.9-51.6) events/h to 7.5 (2.4-18.6) events/h (P < 0.001). Of the 15/20 patients with OSA on placebo (AHI > 10 events/hr), AHI was lowered by 74% (62-88%) (P < 0.001) and all 15 patients exhibited a >/=50% reduction. Genioglossus responsiveness increased approximately threefold, from 2.2 (1.1-4.7)%/cm H(2)O on placebo to 6.3 (3.0 to 18.3)%/cm H(2)O on ato-oxy (P < 0.001). Neither atomoxetine nor oxybutynin reduced the AHI when administered separately. Conclusions: A combination of noradrenergic and antimuscarinic agents administered orally before bedtime on 1 night greatly reduced OSA severity. These findings open new possibilities for the pharmacologic treatment of OSA. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02908529).
