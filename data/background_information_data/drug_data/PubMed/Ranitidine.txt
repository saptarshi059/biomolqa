Ranitidine is an H2-receptor antagonist that was released recently for use in the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and systemic mastocytosis with gastric hypersecretion. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical utility of ranitidine are presented. The drug is similar in therapeutic effect to its predecessor, cimetidine, yet has certain advantages over cimetidine in clinical applications.
Acute dystonia is a dramatic form of extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotic medications. Although extrapyramidal reactions have been noted in related drugs, there are no existing reports associated with ranitidine. This report describes a case of an acute dystonic reaction secondary to a commonly prescribed, currently approved over-the-counter drug, ranitidine.
Adverse reactions involving the central nervous system have been rarely reported with ranitidine, a H2-receptor antagonist. A 72 year old female is described that developed visual hallucinations shortly after initiation of ranitidine therapy. Rechallenge with the drug resulted in both visual and auditory hallucinations following a single dose.
We report the case of a 72-year-old male patient who developed a florid photosensitive eruption while on ranitidine therapy. Ultraviolet A sensitivity was detected by irradiation monochromator testing, suggesting drug-induced photosensitivity. Ranitidine was concluded to be the cause of his photosensitivity since the eruption resolved and the phototest abnormalities returned to normal following cessation of therapy. Similar cases have been reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines but not published.
Black tongue is a rare, benign, self-limiting disorder caused by certain conditions and some medications. We report the first case of a child diagnosed with black tongue associated with ranitidine use. We report our case to emphasize the rare side effect of this frequently used drug. Health care professionals should be aware of the likelihood of ranitidine-induced black tongue in clinical practice.
