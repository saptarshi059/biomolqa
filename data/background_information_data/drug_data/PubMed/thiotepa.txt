Neoplastic meningitis (NM) is a common problem in neuro-oncology occurring in approximately 5% of all patients with cancer, and is the third most common site of CNS metastases. NM is a disease affecting the entire neuraxis, and therefore clinical manifestations are pleomorphic affecting the spine, cranial nerves, and cerebral hemispheres. Because of craniospinal disease involvement, staging and treatment need to encompass all CSF compartments. Treatment of NM utilizes involved-field radiotherapy of bulky or symptomatic disease sites and intra-CSF drug therapy. The inclusion of concomitant systemic therapy may benefit patients with NM and may obviate the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy. At present, intra-CSF drug therapy is confined to three chemotherapeutic agents (ie, methotrexate, cytarabine, and thiotepa) administered by a variety of schedules either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Although treatment of NM is palliative with an expected median patient survival of 2 to 6 months, it often affords stabilization and protection from further neurologic deterioration in patients with NM.
In this issue of Blood, Omuro et al report the results of a phase 2 study for patients with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) using induction immunochemotherapy (rituximab, high-dose methotrexate [MTX], vincristine, procarbazine) followed by a novel consolidation high-dose chemotherapy (thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide) and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC-ASCT).
Periorbital depigmentation developed in a black man approximately six months after the application of an ophthalmic solution containing thiotepa. The drug was used postoperatively to prevent revascularization after removal of a pterygium. By light and electron microscopy, melanocytes were apparently absent in the depigmented area. The list of medications and chemicals that can cause cutaneous depigmentation is growing. An appropriate history may be of considerable value in the evaluation of vitiligo-like conditions.
Since the first reported case of using adjuvant topical immunotherapy utilizing bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was published by Herr and associates, several institutions have utilized numerous agents for topical infusion therapies (BCG, Mitomycin, Epirubicin, Thiotepa or combination therapy of BCG/INF) as adjuncts in the treatment of upper tract papillary transitional cell carcinoma. A comprehensive review of the current data in the treatment of upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (Ta/T1 disease) with adjuvant BCG therapy was completed. Currently, the efficacy of adjuvant BCG therapy was not demonstrated.
Superficial bladder cancer can be treated surgically, but patients are at high risk for recurrence. Tumors are categorized as low, intermediate, and high-risk based on grade, stage, and pattern of recurrence. Low-risk tumors are best treated with a single instillation of chemotherapy (thiotepa, doxorubicin, or mitomycin) (Lamm, 2002). Though effective, the toxicity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy (BCG) restricts its use to treat higher-grade tumors. Intermediate risk tumors can be treated with chemotherapy as well, but will often require immunotherapy. High-risk tumors are best treated with intravesical BCG using a 3-week maintenance schedule. Side effects of BCG immunotherapy can be decreased by logarithmic reductions in dose. Patients who fail BCG may be rescued with BCG plus interferon alfa or radical cystectomy.
