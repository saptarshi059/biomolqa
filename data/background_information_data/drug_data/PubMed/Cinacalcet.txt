BACKGROUND: Calcimimetics are widely used in hemodialysis patients and influence serum calcium levels. Although the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines argued that low calcium levels induced by calcimimetics may be harmless, large observational studies investigating the association between hypocalcemia and mortality are scarce. We investigated the association between serum calcium levels and cardiovascular mortality in calcimimetics users using the nationwide Japanese registry for dialysis patients. METHODS: In this 9-year prospective cohort study, the baseline data were collected at the end of 2009. We enrolled patients on maintenance hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration. We employed three models (baseline, time-dependent and time-averaged) to conduct Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. RESULTS: Cinacalcet was prescribed to 12.7% (N = 22 853) at baseline. The median observation period was 98 (interquartile range 40-108) months and 108 (interquartile range 59-108) months in the whole cohort (N = 180 136) and in cinacalcet users, respectively. Three-quarters of survivors at the end of 2019 had continued calcimimetic therapy for 10 years, corresponding to a mean annual dropout rate of 2.9%. Hypocalcemia was not associated with cardiovascular mortality in the baseline or time-averaged model. In the time-dependent model, however, the lowest calcium decile (corrected calcium <8.4 mg/dL) was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular mortality than the reference (corrected calcium 8.7-8.9 mg/dL) in both cinacalcet users and all patients [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.32 (1.00, 1.75) and 1.15 (1.05, 1.26), respectively]. Hypocalcemia was especially associated with sudden death and death due to hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Higher rate of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events was observed in hypocalcemic patients regardless of cinacalcet usage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that transient hypocalcemia was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death independent of cinacalcet usage. We should pay attention to hypocalcemia transiently induced by cinacalcet.
BACKGROUND: Disorders of mineral metabolism, including secondary hyperparathyroidism, are thought to contribute to extraskeletal (including vascular) calcification among patients with chronic kidney disease. It has been hypothesized that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet might reduce the risk of death or nonfatal cardiovascular events in such patients. METHODS: In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 3883 patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (median level of intact parathyroid hormone, 693 pg per milliliter [10th to 90th percentile, 363 to 1694]) who were undergoing hemodialysis to receive either cinacalcet or placebo. All patients were eligible to receive conventional therapy, including phosphate binders, vitamin D sterols, or both. The patients were followed for up to 64 months. The primary composite end point was the time until death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or a peripheral vascular event. The primary analysis was performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The median duration of study-drug exposure was 21.2 months in the cinacalcet group, versus 17.5 months in the placebo group. The primary composite end point was reached in 938 of 1948 patients (48.2%) in the cinacalcet group and 952 of 1935 patients (49.2%) in the placebo group (relative hazard in the cinacalcet group vs. the placebo group, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.11). Hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more frequent in patients receiving cinacalcet. CONCLUSIONS: In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not significantly reduce the risk of death or major cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who were undergoing dialysis.

Lithium is the gold standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Studies have shown an association between lithium and hyperparathyroidism. However, there is limited data regarding the management of lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism. We present a clinical conundrum which physicians frequently encounter-an excellent lithium responder refractory to other treatments who developed lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism. Medical treatment with cinacalcet was successful in management of hyperparathyroidism without discontinuing lithium maintenance therapy.
Calcimimetics are ligands that activate the calcium receptor. Some are small molecules and of these, the most extensively studied are phenylalkylamines like cinacalcet. This compound is a positive allosteric modulator that selectively targets the parathyroid calcium receptor to inhibit the secretion of parathyroid hormone. Cinacalcet is the first calcimimetic compound to attain regulatory approval for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism resulting from end-stage renal disease. The discovery of calcimimetics and the receptor they act on are considered with the intent of extracting lessons relevant to medical research and the discovery of new drugs.
RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Parathyroidectomy and calcimimetics have been used to reduce fracture risk in patients with kidney failure and advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), but direct comparisons of these treatment approaches have not been implemented. This pilot study compared their effects on bone mineral density (BMD) in this patient population. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective pilot open-label randomized trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 65 patients receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis with advanced SHPT recruited from 2 university-affiliated hospitals in Hong Kong. INTERVENTIONS: Total parathyroidectomy with forearm autografting versus oral cinacalcet treatment for 12 months. OUTCOME: Prespecified secondary end points including changes in BMD z and T scores of femoral neck, lumbar spine, and distal radius 12 months after treatment initiation and also categorized as osteopenia or osteoporosis according to the World Health Organization. RESULTS: Both total parathyroidectomy and cinacalcet significantly improved BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck over 12 months, but the total parathyroidectomy group had a greater increase than the cinacalcet-treated group (P<0.001). The proportion of study participants classified as having osteopenia/osteoporosis by femoral neck T-score fell from 78.2% to 51.7% in the total parathyroidectomy group (P<0.001) and from 65.7% to 52.0% in cinacalcet-treated group after 12 months (P=0.7). The proportion of participants with a T-score at the lumbar spine classified as osteopenia/osteoporosis fell from 53.1% to 31.0% in the total parathyroidectomy group (P=0.01) and from 59.4% to 53.8% with cinacalcet (P=0.3). No significant change was observed in BMD T or z score of the distal radius over 12 months with either intervention. LIMITATIONS: Bone histology was not assessed, and the study duration was 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of peritoneal dialysis patients with advanced SHPT had low bone densities and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Total parathyroidectomy increased the BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck and reduced osteopenia/osteoporosis more than oral cinacalcet. FUNDING: Grants from academic (The University of Hong Kong Research) and not-for-profit (Hong Kong Society of Nephrology) entities. REGISTRATION: Registered at Clinicaltrials.gov with study number NCT01447368. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: It is not known whether oral cinacalcet and surgical parathyroidectomy differ in their effects on bone parameters in patients with advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) receiving peritoneal dialysis. This pilot randomized trial evaluated the effect of medical versus surgical therapy on bone mineral densities (BMD) as prespecified secondary study end points. The findings showed that a large proportion of peritoneal dialysis patients with advanced SHPT had low bone densities and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Parathyroidectomy increased the BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck more than cinacalcet over 12 months. Parathyroidectomy reduced the proportion of patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis at the lumbar spine and femoral neck more than cinacalcet after 12 months. Neither intervention led to an increase in the BMD of the distal radius over 12 months.
