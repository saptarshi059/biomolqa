On occasion of a carotid angiography in man, regional cerebral bloodflow (rCBF) was measured before and after the injection of thiopental 5 mg/kg I.V. A significant decrease of rCBF was found after thiopental, in a previous study, due to a decrease of the brainmetabolism. To study the influence of piracetam and of etiracetam on this decrease of rCBF, 22 patients received intravenously the evening before the investigation 4 g piracetam or 4 g etiracetam or placebo, as well in the morning before the investigation and 30 minutes before the injection of thiopental. Besides the rCBF also other parameters were measured: arterial pressures, cardiac output, heart rate, as well as blood gases, glucose, lactate and pyruvate in the arterial blood and the cerebral venous blood, and blood gases in the mixed venous blood. There was no influence on the decrease of rCBF neither in the piracetam or etiracetam group, compared to the placebogroup. A few scarce minor changes were seen in the other measured parameters.
In this contribution different solid-state forms of the racemic compound (RS)-2-(2-oxo-pyrrolidin-1yl)-butyramide are studied from a structural and thermal point of view. Three different solid-state phases were identified, including two polymorphs and one hydrate phase. Comparison is made with the structure of the (S)-enantiomer, for which only one solid-state phase is known. The basic structural motif found in both polymorphs of the racemic compound is similar, but the basic motif observed for the hydrate differs. These synthons could in principle be used in future polymorph prediction studies to screen for possible alternative forms of the enantiopure compound. Based on the structure of the hydrate, further efforts should therefore be made in order to identify a hydrate structure of the enantiopure compound. Studying the different phases of a racemic compound can therefore help to guide polymorphic screening of an enantiopure compound.
