Mefloquine is a quinoline-based compound widely used as an antimalarial drug, particularly in chemoprophylaxis. Although decades of research have identified various aspects of mefloquine's anti-Plasmodium properties, toxic effects offset its robust use in humans. Mefloquine exerts harmful effects in several types of human cells by targeting many of the cellular lipids, proteins, and complexes, thereby blocking a number of downstream signaling cascades. In general, mefloquine modulates several cellular phenomena, such as alteration of membrane potential, induction of oxidative stress, imbalance of ion homeostasis, disruption of metabolism, failure of organelle function, etc., leading to cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death. This review aims to summarize the information on functional and mechanistic findings related to the cytotoxic effects of mefloquine.
According to WHO, 2019 witnessed 229 million cases of malaria globally, of which Africa accounted for 94% of cases. Early diagnosis and treatment are the basis of malaria management, and the need for good chemoprophylaxis especially for people travelling to endemic areas is vital. There are a number of drug options available for the prophylaxis of malaria, mefloquine being one of the drugs used. Mefloquine has been around from the 1970s, and was developed in the United States keeping in mind the soldiers that were being deployed to areas where chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium were discovered. Mefloquine was preferred for its once a week dosage. Within a decade of its introduction, reports of the side effects associated with its long-term use surfaced. Mefloquine is now reported to cause a myriad of neuropsychiatric side effects including anxiety, sleep disturbance, depression, dizziness and frank psychosis, especially in patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Many countries like the United States and the United Kingdom have updated their drug boxes to include the warning of these potential neuropsychiatric effects. This paper reviews the side effects of mefloquine and why there is a need to revisit its use in Indian drug policy.
Mefloquine hydrochloride, a new 4-quinolinemethanol, was administered as a single oral dose to 47 volunteers infected with malaria. Treatment resulted in rapid clearence of fever and parasitemia. No recrudescence of parasites was observed after treatment of chloroquine-sensitive infections of Plasmodium falciparum. More significantly, in nonimmune persons with chloroquine-resistant infections, 1 gram of mefloquine cured 10 of 12 patients and 1.5 grams cured all 8 patients who received this dose of the drug. The marked activity of a single dose of mefloquine against chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum suggests that this agent may be more useful than currently available drugs are for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria.
Mefloquine, a potent blood schizontocide, is effective against drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. This property, along with its unique pharmacokinetic profile, makes mefloquine a widely prescribed antimalarial drug. However, several epidemiological studies have raised concerns on the safety of mefloquine as prophylaxis for malaria. Well-documented side-effects of mefloquine include abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety, and depressed mood, as well as nausea and dizziness (the last two most frequent effects). The mechanisms that underlie the neurological/psychiatric complications of mefloquine are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the neurotoxic mechanisms of action of mefloquine to better understand its potential toxicity in the central nervous system, highlighting the mechanisms that lead to its psychiatric disorders. Experimental studies on the neurotoxic effects of mefloquine discussed herein include brain transporters of mefloquine, alteration in neurotransmitters, disruption on calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis and neuroinflammation, generation of oxidative stress response in neurons (involving glutathione, increased F2-isoprostanes, accumulation of cytosolic lipid globules), and alteration of voltage-dependent channels, as well as gap junction intercellular communications. Although several hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanisms that mediate mefloquine-induced brain damage, they are not fully understood, necessitating additional studies in the future.
A woman is described who developed fear of flying because she took mefloquine as malaria prophylaxis prior to the flight. Mefloquine, because of its potential neurotoxicity, should not be used for persons with fear of flying.
