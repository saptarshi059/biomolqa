Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a primarily functional form of acute kidney injury (AKI) that develops in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The pathophysiologic cascade that leads to HRS begins with pooling of blood in the splanchnic system, resulting in a decrease in effective circulating arterial volume. The definitive treatment of HRS is liver transplantation. When this is not possible, HRS is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictor agents and intravenous albumin. Although the combination of midodrine and octreotide is used in the United States, the recently approved terlipressin, an analog of vasopressin, is likely to become the first-line standard of care.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the management of orthostatic hypotension with emphasis on neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. RECENT FINDINGS: Establishing whether the cause of orthostatic hypotension is a pathologic lesion in sympathetic neurons (ie, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) or secondary to other medical causes (ie, non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) can be achieved by measuring blood pressure and heart rate at the bedside. Whereas fludrocortisone has been extensively used as first-line treatment in the past, it is associated with adverse events including renal and cardiac failure and increased risk of all-cause hospitalization. Distinguishing whether neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is caused by central or peripheral dysfunction has therapeutic implications. Patients with peripheral sympathetic denervation respond better to norepinephrine agonists/precursors such as droxidopa, whereas patients with central autonomic dysfunction respond better to norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. SUMMARY: Management of orthostatic hypotension is aimed at improving quality of life and reducing symptoms rather than at normalizing blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic measures are the key to success. Pharmacologic options include volume expansion with fludrocortisone and sympathetic enhancement with midodrine, droxidopa, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Neurogenic supine hypertension complicates management of orthostatic hypotension and is primarily ameliorated by avoiding the supine position and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated.
Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a sustained fall in blood pressure on standing that can cause symptoms of organ hypoperfusion. OH is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and leads to a significant number of hospital admissions. OH can be caused by volume depletion, blood loss, cardiac pump failure, large varicose veins, medications, or defective activation of sympathetic nerves and reduced norepinephrine release upon standing. Neurogenic OH is a frequent and disabling problem in patients with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure, and it is commonly associated with supine hypertension. Several therapeutic options are available.
Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling disorder caused by impairment of the normal autonomic compensatory mechanisms that maintain upright blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic treatment is always the first step in the management of this condition, but a considerable number of patients will require pharmacologic therapies. Denervation hypersensitivity and impairment of baroreflex buffering makes these patients sensitive to small doses of pressor agents. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology can help in selecting between treatment options. In general, patients with low "sympathetic reserve", i.e., those with peripheral noradrenergic degeneration (pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease) and low plasma norepinephrine, tend to respond better to "norepinephrine replacers" (midodrine and droxidopa). On the other hand, patients with relatively preserved "sympathetic reserve", i.e., those with impaired central autonomic pathways but spared peripheral noradrenergic fibers (multiple system atrophy) and normal or slightly reduced plasma norepinephrine, tend to respond better to "norepinephrine enhancers" (pyridostigmine, atomoxetine, and yohimbine). There is, however, a spectrum of responses within these extremes, and treatment should be individualized. Other nonspecific treatments include fludrocortisone and octreotide. The presence of associated clinical conditions, such as supine hypertension, heart failure, postprandial hypotension, PD, MSA, and diabetes need to be considered in the pharmacologic management of these patients.
Among the complications of cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is characterized by having the worst survival rate. HRS is a disorder that involves the deterioration of kidney function caused primarily by a systemic circulatory dysfunction, but in recent years, systemic inflammation and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy have been discovered to also play an important role. The diagnosis of HRS requires to meet the new International Club of Ascites-Acute Kidney Injury (ICA-AKI) and Hepatorenal Syndrome-Acute Kidney Injury (HRS-AKI) criteria after ruling out other causes of kidney injury. At the time of diagnosis, it is important to start the medical treatment as soon as possible where three types of vasoconstrictors have been recognized: vasopressin analogs (ornipressin and terlipressin), alpha-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and midodrine) and somatostatin analogues (octreotide); all should be combined with albumin infusion. Among them, terlipressin and albumin are the first lines of treatment in most cases, although terlipressin should be monitor closely due to its adverse events. The best treatment of choice is a liver transplant, because it is the only definitive treatment for this disease.
