Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that lacks therapies to prevent progressive neurodegeneration. Impaired energy metabolism and reduced ATP levels are common features of PD. Previous studies revealed that terazosin (TZ) enhances the activity of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), thereby stimulating glycolysis and increasing cellular ATP levels. Therefore, we asked whether enhancement of PGK1 activity would change the course of PD. In toxin-induced and genetic PD models in mice, rats, flies, and induced pluripotent stem cells, TZ increased brain ATP levels and slowed or prevented neuron loss. The drug increased dopamine levels and partially restored motor function. Because TZ is prescribed clinically, we also interrogated 2 distinct human databases. We found slower disease progression, decreased PD-related complications, and a reduced frequency of PD diagnoses in individuals taking TZ and related drugs. These findings suggest that enhancing PGK1 activity and increasing glycolysis may slow neurodegeneration in PD.
Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) are efficacious in treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), also termed symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), causing bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). There is little difference among the various alpha-blockers in terms of efficacy in treating LUTS. However, conventional quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin, originally developed for hypertension, have inherent cardiovascular extension effects, which influence the well being and safety of patients with LUTS by impairing physiological blood pressure (BP) control, even when their effect on unchallenged BP may be quite low. Preclinically, tamsulosin, a sulphonamide-substituted phenethylamine, has a relative selectivity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptors of the lower urinary tract. Clinically, this is associated with fewer cardiovascular extension effects with tamsulosin (modified release capsule) 0.4 mg once daily. This allows the use of convenient regimens of 0.4 mg tamsulosin administered once daily after breakfast from initiation of treatment without the need for 'step-up' increases of dose to avoid 'first-dose' hypotension. Extensive investigation, including multiple orthostatic stress testing (which otherwise is unusual in the characterization of alpha-blockers because of their inherent safety), confirms that tamsulosin 0.4 mg definitely carries a lower risk of impaired BP control.
PURPOSE: To describe the otorhinolaryngological adverse effects of the main drugs used in urological practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the scientific literature was performed using a combination of specific descriptors (side effect, adverse effect, scopolamine, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, oxybutynin, tolterodine, spironolactone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, doxazosin, alfuzosin, terazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin, desmopressin) contained in publications until April 2020. Manuscripts written in English, Portuguese, and Spanish were manually selected from the title and abstract. The main drugs used in Urology were divided into five groups to describe their possible adverse effects: alpha-blockers, anticholinergics, diuretics, hormones, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. RESULTS: The main drugs used in Urology may cause several otorhinolaryngological adverse effects. Dizziness was most common, but dry mouth, rhinitis, nasal congestion, epistaxis, hearing loss, tinnitus, and rhinorrhea were also reported and varies among drug classes. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the drugs used in urological practice have otorhinolaryngological adverse effects. Dizziness was most common, but dry mouth, rhinitis, nasal congestion, epistaxis, hearing loss, tinnitus, and rhinorrhea were also reported. Therefore, doctors must be aware of these adverse effects to improve adherence to the treatment and to minimize damage to the health of patients.
Certain alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonists induce significant apoptosis and impair tumor vascularity without affecting cellular proliferation, effects specific to the quinazoline structure. These anticancer effects have been attributed to both induction of classical apoptosis and reversal of anoikis resistance via disruption of integrin-mediated cell survival pathways. Recent drug optimization efforts have generated several novel compounds with quinazoline-derived chemical structure that exert potent anti-tumor activity via anoikis. Results from pre-clinical and clinical studies implicate a potential value of quinazoline-based analogues in prostate cancer prevention and therapy. A retrospective study of a large patient cohort at our center, revealed that treatment with alpha1-andrenoreceptor antagonists significantly reduced the risk of developing prostate cancer, indicating a potential chemopreventative mechanism for these FDA-approved agents. In the present review we discuss the current understanding of the signaling mechanisms reversing anoikis resistance by the quinazoline-based compounds in prostate tumors, towards enabling identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common disorders of aging men. As the world population is aging these two diseases are becoming a significant public health problem worldwide. Approximately 30% of men treated for BPH have coexisting hypertension. The alpha-Adrenergic Blockers: Prazosin, Terazosin and Doxazosin are established agents in the therapy of hypertension, and are also effective drugs in the treatment of BPH. It is reasonable to use alpha-Adrenergic Blockers as the treatment of choice for men with hypertension and BPH.
