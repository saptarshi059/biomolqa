INTRODUCTION: Paracetamol is one of the most used medicines worldwide and is the most common important poisoning in high-income countries. In overdose, paracetamol causes dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine is an effective antidote, however despite its use hepatotoxicity and many deaths still occur. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes paracetamol overdose and toxicity (including mechanisms, risk factors, risk assessment, and treatment). In addition, we summarize the epidemiology of paracetamol overdose worldwide. A literature search on PubMed for poisoning epidemiology and mortality from 1 January 2017 to 26 October 2022 was performed to estimate rates of paracetamol overdose, liver injury, and deaths worldwide. EXPERT OPINION: Paracetamol is widely available and yet is substantially more toxic than other analgesics available without prescription. Where data were available, we estimate that paracetamol is involved in 6% of poisonings, 56% of severe acute liver injury and acute liver failure, and 7% of drug-induced liver injury. These estimates are limited by lack of available data from many countries, particularly in Asia, South America, and Africa. Harm reduction from paracetamol is possible through better identification of high-risk overdoses, and better treatment regimens. Large overdoses and those involving modified-release paracetamol are high-risk and can be targeted through legislative change.
1 The rate of absorption of oral paracetamol depends on the rate of gastric emptying and is usually rapid and complete. The mean systemic availability is about 75%. 2 Paracetamol is extensively metabolized and the plasma half-life is 1.5-2.5 hours. About 55% and 30% of a therapeutic dose is excreted in the urine as glucuronide and sulphate conjugates, respectively, whereas mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates (representing conversion to a potentially toxic intermediate metabolite) each account for some 4% of the dose. Paracetamol metabolism is age- and dose-dependent. 3 With hepatotoxic doses, paracetamol metabolism is impaired and the half-life prolonged. Sulphate conjugation is saturated and the proportion excreted as mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates is increased. 4 The renal clearance of paracetamol depends on urine flow rate by not pH. The renal clearances of the glucuronide and sulphate conjugates often exceed the glomerular filtration rate and are independent of urine flow and pH. 5 Phenacetin absorption depends on formulation. It is extensively metabolized to paracetamol and minor metabolites are probably responsible for toxicity.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally considered to be a weak inhibitor of the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). However, the in vivo effects of paracetamol are similar to those of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Paracetamol also decreases PG concentrations in vivo, but, unlike the selective COX-2 inhibitors, paracetamol does not suppress the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. It does, however, decrease swelling after oral surgery in humans and suppresses inflammation in rats and mice. Paracetamol is a weak inhibitor of PG synthesis of COX-1 and COX-2 in broken cell systems, but, by contrast, therapeutic concentrations of paracetamol inhibit PG synthesis in intact cells in vitro when the levels of the substrate arachidonic acid are low (less than about 5 mumol/L). When the levels of arachidonic acid are low, PGs are synthesized largely by COX-2 in cells that contain both COX-1 and COX-2. Thus, the apparent selectivity of paracetamol may be due to inhibition of COX-2-dependent pathways that are proceeding at low rates. This hypothesis is consistent with the similar pharmacological effects of paracetamol and the selective COX-2 inhibitors. COX-3, a splice variant of COX-1, has been suggested to be the site of action of paracetamol, but genomic and kinetic analysis indicates that this selective interaction is unlikely to be clinically relevant. There is considerable evidence that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is central and is due to activation of descending serotonergic pathways, but its primary site of action may still be inhibition of PG synthesis. The action of paracetamol at a molecular level is unclear but could be related to the production of reactive metabolites by the peroxidase function of COX-2, which could deplete glutathione, a cofactor of enzymes such as PGE synthase.
Paracetamol is safe and effective at the therapeutic dose. It is beneficial as an analgesic and is an effective antipyretic. Paracetamol is cheap and easy to buy over the counter, which makes it a common choice in intentional overdose.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was marketed in the 1950s as a nonprescription analgesic/antipyretic without any preclinical toxicity studies. It became used increasingly for self-poisoning, particularly in the UK and was belatedly found to cause acute liver damage, which could be fatal. Management of poisoned patients was difficult as maximum abnormalities of liver function were delayed for 3 days or more after an overdose. There was no treatment and the mechanism of hepatotoxicity was not known. The paracetamol half-life was prolonged with liver damage occurring when it exceeded 4 h and the Rumack-Matthew nomogram was an important advance that allowed stratification of patients into separate zones of risk. It is used to guide prognosis and treatment and its predictive value could be increased by combining it with the paracetamol half-life. The problems of a sheep farmer in Australia in the early 1970s led to the discovery of the mechanism of paracetamol hepatotoxicity, and the first effective treatment of overdosage with intravenous (IV) cysteamine. This had unpleasant side effects and administration was difficult. N-acetylcysteine soon became the treatment of choice for paracetamol overdose and given early it was very effective when administered either IV or orally. N-acetylcysteine could cause anaphylactoid reactions, particularly early during IV administration when the concentrations were highest. Simpler and shorter regimes with slower initial rates of infusion have now been introduced with a reduced incidence of these adverse effects. In addition, there has been a move to use larger doses of N-acetylcysteine given over longer periods for patients who are more severely poisoned and those with risk factors. There has been much interest recently in the search for novel biomarkers such as microRNAs, procalcitonin and cyclophilin that promise to have greater specificity and sensitivity than transaminases. Paracetamol-protein adducts predict hepatotoxicity and are specific biomarkers of toxic paracetamol metabolite exposure. Another approach would be measurement of the plasma levels of cysteine and inorganic sulfate. It is 50 years since the first effective treatment for paracetamol poisoning and, apart from liver transplantation, there is still no effective treatment for patients who present late.
