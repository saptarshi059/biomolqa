Hypertension is the leading cause of death worldwide, affecting 1.4 billion people. Treatment options include the widely used calcium channel blockers, among which amlodipine, a dihydropyridine, has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other drugs within this class. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the evidence supporting the use of amlodipine over the past 30 years and highlights its cardiovascular benefits in current hypertension management. Amlodipine has low renal clearance (7 mL/min/mg) and long half-life (35-50 h) and duration of action, which allows it to sustain its anti-hypertensive effect for more than 24 h following a single dose. Additionally, blood pressure (BP) control is maintained even when a dose has been missed, providing continuous protection in case of incidental noncompliance. It has proven to reduce BP variability and successfully lower BP. Amlodipine also controls BP in patients with a systolic/diastolic BP of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease without worsening glycemic or kidney function. Additionally, amlodipine is a wise choice for older adults due to its ability to control BP and protect against stroke and myocardial infarction. Side effects of amlodipine include edema, palpitations, dizziness, and flushing, which are more common with the higher dose of 10 mg. Amlodipine is cost effective and predicted to be cost saving when compared with usual care.
Amlodipine, a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has a mode of action and pharmacodynamic profile which are comparable to those of conventional compounds in this series, such as nifedipine. Its physicochemical behavior, however, appears to be somewhat different. A pKa value of 8.7 means that amlodipine is predominantly present in the ionized form at a physiologic pH. It possesses, therefore, a strong affinity for cell membranes. These phenomena apparently contribute to amlodipine's unique pharmacokinetic profile, which is characterized by almost complete absorption, late-peak plasma concentrations, high bioavailability, and slow hepatic biodegradation. This profile translates into potential clinical benefits by virtue of a slow onset of action and long duration of effect. The slow onset of action may explain why there seems to be very little reflex tachycardia and a lower incidence of vasodilator side effects when comparing amlodipine with conventional dihydropyridines. The slow elimination of amlodipine explains the long duration of action, which allows a convenient once-daily dosage schedule.
BACKGROUND: There is a lack of sufficient evidence regarding efficacy and safety of amlodipine on treating hypertension during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To compare antihypertensive efficacy, pregnancy outcome and safety of amlodipine with nifedipine on hypertension during pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and China Biology Medicine disc of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to April l5, 2021 was conducted on RCTs comparing amlodipine to nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. To estimate relative effects from all available evidence, a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs were included. Amlodipine was found the efficacy is slightly superior to nifedipine on treating hypertension during pregnancy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10) with a decreased risk for maternal side effects (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.61). Subgroup analysis found amlodipine can get a better control on SBP (RR - 11.68, 95% CI - 17.98 to - 5.37) and DBP (RR - 7.44, 95% CI - 13.81 to - 1.06) compared with intermediate-/long-acting nifedipine. In addition, there was no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine on pregnancy outcomes including caesarean section, premature labour, placental abruption, FGR, fetal distress, neonatal asphyxia. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis, amlodipine can be effectively and safely used for hypertension during pregnancy.
Gingival overgrowth is a common feature of periodontal diseases. Rarely it occurs as an unwanted side effect of drugs such as anticonvulsants mainly phenytoin, immunosuppressants like cyclosporine and calcium channel blockers particularly nifedipine. Among calcium channel blockers, nifedipine causes gingival overgrowth in 10% of patients whereas amlodipine-induced gingival overgrowth is very limited. Here we report four cases in hypertensives on amlodipine.
The US Food and Drug Administration recently granted an approved indication for the first fixed-dose combination antihypertensive (amlodipine) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (celecoxib) for treatment of comorbid hypertension and osteoarthritis. This review summarizes available data on this combination product, to be marketed as Consensi (Kitov Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Tel Aviv, Israel), and discusses its potential place in therapy.
