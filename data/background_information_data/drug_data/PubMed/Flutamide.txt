The use of combined androgen blockade therapy in prostate cancer management remains controversial. This article reviews the effect of the different non-steroid androgens in blocking androgen-independent activation of the androgen receptor in the androgen-depleted environment, and the potential benefit of bicalutamide in comparison to the first generation of anti-androgens (flutamide and nilutamide). An estimate of the benefit of combined therapy with bicalutamide suggests there is a high probability that bicalutamide 50 mg as combined therapy provides a survival advantage over castration alone. This treatment must be balanced against the potential for an increase in side-effects and a consequent adverse effect on the patient's quality of life.
In this paper, we designed and extended modification basing on the flutamide structure. A series of flutamide-conjugates were obtained with methyl bromoacetate and ethylenediamine. Through the synthesis of two conjugates with 3,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzoate derivatives, these flutamide conjugates were tested for anticancer activity. Among the compounds tested, the flutamide-conjugates showed good inhibition activity against cancer cell lines U-251, PC-3 and K-562. The conjugates showed a better inhibitory effect than free flutamide and did not show activity against normal COS-7 monkey kidney fibroblast cells. It was also observed that the flutamide conjugates had an inhibitory effect against human colorectal adenocarcinoma HCT-15.
Two cases of clinically manifest liver failure in patients with metastatic prostatic cancer treated with the non-steroidal antiandrogen flutamide combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue are described. One patient developed severe hepatic insufficiency with jaundice, ascites and hepatic coma. The condition reversed after discontinuation of flutamide. The other patient only became jaundiced with a biochemical cholestatic pattern. Previous reports of hepatic adverse reactions only include elevated transaminase levels without clinical manifestations. The morphological lesions in the liver biopsy and the clinical condition may be due to a reversible interaction with metabolic processes in the hepatocytes.
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in men worldwide. This review article contains a summary of analyzes performed by chromatographic methods used for the determination of abiraterone acetate, bicalutamide, cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, flutamide, goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride drugs used in prostate cancer applications in biological and pharmacological samples. In this review, sample preparation procedures, chromatographic procedures, and detectors used for analytical determinations of these drugs are discussed.
Ten hirsute women were treated with flutamide (250 mg/day) for 6 months to evaluate its effect. Hair growth as assessed by the Ferriman and Gallwey hair score was significantly reduced in all patients (P less than 0.01). The only significant change in endocrine levels was an increase in serum androstenedione (P less than 0.01). Acne and seborrhea improved markedly. No side effects were noted during the treatment. Our data suggest that the antiandrogenic properties of flutamide render it a suitable single agent in the treatment of hirsutism.
