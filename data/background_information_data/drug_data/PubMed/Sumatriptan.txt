Frequency and torment caused by migraines direct patients toward a variety of remedies. Few studies to date have proposed ginger derivates for migraine relief. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ginger in the ablation of common migraine attack in comparison to sumatriptan therapy. In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 100 patients who had acute migraine without aura were randomly allocated to receive either ginger powder or sumatriptan. Time of headache onset, its severity, time interval from headache beginning to taking drug and patient self-estimation about response for five subsequent migraine attacks were recorded by patients. Patients(,) satisfaction from treatment efficacy and their willingness to continue it was also evaluated after 1 month following intervention. Two hours after using either drug, mean headaches severity decreased significantly. Efficacy of ginger powder and sumatriptan was similar. Clinical adverse effects of ginger powder were less than sumatriptan. Patients' satisfaction and willingness to continue did not differ. The effectiveness of ginger powder in the treatment of common migraine attacks is statistically comparable to sumatriptan. Ginger also poses a better side effect profile than sumatriptan.
Headache care specialists agree that the introduction of sumatriptan constitutes a major advance in headache therapy, but they differ about whether other triptans offer clinically significant advantages over sumatriptan. This article examines this issue by considering the similarities and differences among triptans.
Scientific literature describes that sumatriptan is metabolized by oxidative deamination of its dimethylaminoethyl residue by monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) and not by cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated demethylation, as is usual for such structural elements. Using recombinant human enzymes and HPLC-MS analysis, we found that CYP enzymes may also be involved in the metabolism of sumatriptan. The CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 isoforms converted this drug into N-desmethyl sumatriptan, which was further demethylated to N,N-didesmethyl sumatriptan by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Otherwise, sumatriptan and its two desmethyl metabolites were metabolized by recombinant MAO A but not by MAO B to the corresponding acetaldehyde, with sumatriptan being only a poor substrate for MAO A compared to the N-demethylated and the N,N-didemethylated derivatives.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this report was to describe a case with paracentral acute middle maculopathy after oral intake of sumatriptan. METHODS: Case presentation. RESULTS: One patient showed typical findings on fundoscopic examination and optical coherence tomography consistent with paracentral acute middle maculopathy following oral intake of sumatriptan. CONCLUSION: Sumatriptan may be a trigger for paracentral acute middle maculopathy.
Sumatriptan is a novel serotonin 1 (5-hydroxytryptamine 1; 5-HT1)-like agonist which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute migraine. Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies reflect the way that sumatriptan will be used in routine practice, but relatively few studies have been published. Bioavailability is high (96%) following subcutaneous injection, but low (14%) following oral administration because of first-pass metabolism. Absorption is rapid after subcutaneous injection, with peak concentration reached in 10 minutes. After oral administration, multiple peak concentrations are observed, but a concentration that is 75% of the final peak concentration is usually reached within 45 minutes. Less than 20% of the drug is protein bound. The volume of distribution is greater than total body water at 170L. Total plasma clearance is rapid, with an elimination half-life of around 2 hours. There is one major metabolite (an indole acetic acid analogue) which is excreted in the urine as the free acid and its ester glucuronide conjugate. The pharmacokinetic profile of sumatriptan is not significantly affected by an acute migraine attack (absorption phase), old age or gender. Pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with hepatic and renal disease have not been published; however, care should be taken when sumatriptan is administered to patients with liver disease until such information is available. No significant interaction was found between sumatriptan and propranolol, flunarizine, pizotifen or alcohol (ethanol).
