The article summarizes new advances in cardiology published in 2022, which have an impact to everyday practice of not only internists and cardiologists. The administration of polypill to patients after myocardial infarction (SECURE study), early pharmacotherapy of hypertension in pregnant women with blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg (CHAP study), or the administration of dapagliflozin to patients with heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction (DELIVER study) have been shown to be effective. Patients with heart failure do not have to limit their sodium intake (SODIUM-HF study), on the contrary, they benefit from up-titration of guideline-recommended drugs to the maximum tolerated doses as quickly as possible (STRONG-HF study). For antihypertensives, it does not matter whether they are taken in the morning or in the evening (TIME study), nor has there been found any difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events with hydrochlorothiazide and chlortalidone (DCP study). In patients with increased cardiovascular risk, highly sensitive troponin should be measured before non-cardiac surgery as well as 24 and 48 hours after surgery to detect perioperative myocardial infarction. Different blood pressure and oxygenation targets in patients after resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not affect the outcomes of their treatment.
Most patients with arterial hypertension (AH) require a combination treatment to achieve the goal blood pressure. According to Russian and international clinical guidelines on the treatment of AH patients, various antihypertensive drugs may be combined; however, not all combinations have similar profiles of safety and clinical efficacy. In this respect, special attention is given to combinations of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and thiazide (hydrochlorothiazide) or thiazide-like (chlortalidone, indapamide) diuretics. Diuretics also differ in their mechanisms of action, presence of pleiotropic effects and organ-protective properties, effects on the prognosis, and in the evidence base. This review discusses the place of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics in the treatment of patients with AH and provides an evaluation of major differences in pharmacological and clinical effects of drugs of the diuretic class.
The diuretics acetazolamide, bemetizide, bendroflumethiazide, benzthiazide, benzylhydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, butizide, chlorazanile, chlorothiazide, chlortalidone, clopamide, cyclopenthiazide, cyclothiazide, diazoxide, etozoline, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, hydroflumethiazide, indapamide, mefruside, metolazone, piretanide, polythiazide, trichlormethiazide, and xipamide were screened in vitro for phototoxic effects by means of a photohemolysis test. In all, 19 out of the 25 test substances revealed phototoxic hemolytic properties after irradiation with either solar stimulating irradiation, UVA and/or visible light. Addition of the antioxidants ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherole or superoxide dismutase significantly inhibited the phototoxic hemolysis, as well as did investigations carried out in a nitrogen rich atmosphere, findings which indicate the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the phototoxic process.
The photodegradation process of the phototoxic diuretic drug chlorthalidone was studied. The products of its photolysis under UV-B were isolated and identified. Chlorthalidone was found to be active when examined by photohemolysis on human erythrocytes, but not in the presence of the isolated photoproducts. Inhibition of the photohemolysis process induced by chlorthalidone on addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) or ascorbic acid suggests the involvement of radicals species. The inhibition with 1,4-diazabycyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABCO), sodium azide (NaN3) sowie 2,5-dimethylfuran proof the participation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in this process.
Data are submitted concerning effects of atenol-H on indices for 24-hr monitoring of arterial pressure. As many as 34 patients were examined presenting with stage II hypertensive disease, in whom a 24-hr monitoring of AP was carried out in addition to a conventional measurement of AP as recommended by Korotkov before and after treatment with atenol-H, 1 tabletta per day (atenolol 100 mg, chlortolidon 25 mg). The course of treatment was on the average (26.8 +/- 1 to 4) days. As a result of treatment, values for 24-hr, day, and night AP have gotten decreased. No serious complications have been revealed to warrant withdrawal of the drug.
