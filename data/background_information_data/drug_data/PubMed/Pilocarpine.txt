Although pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets are currently indicated for the treatment of xerostomia, their adverse effects are frequently reported. The development of a new, low-dose pilocarpine solution for topical oral-cavity use is needed. This article discusses a few clinical trials to formulate a topical low-dose solution of pilocarpine hydrochloride for the treatment of xerostomia and presents two low dose, stable formulations of pilocarpine topical spray that can improve the patient's quality of life with minimal adverse effects.
The latest global health threat is the ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, which was named COVID-19 and multiple ever-evolving neurological complications have since been reported. We present the case of a patient with a bilateral tonic pupil in the postinfectious context of COVID 19. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory tests were normal, a 0.125% pilocarpine test confirmed the diagnosis.
Anisocoria, or a difference in pupil size, is a common condition. Its aetiology ranges from benign to life-threatening conditions. The clinical evaluation of anisocoria is discussed, emphasising the pharmacological aids (e.g., cocaine 10% eye drops, hydroxyamphetamine eye drops, pilocarpine 0.1% eye drops, pilocarpine 1% eye drops, apraclonidine) used in differentiating the different causes of anisocoria (e.g., physiological anisocoria, Horner syndrome, Adie pupil, pharmacological anisocoria, third nerve palsy).
A patient with monocular polyopia underwent extensive neurologic investigation over a two-year period. Ocular examination disclosed a corneal degenerative change as the cause, and symptomatic relief was obtained with pilocarpine hydrochloride drops.
Vuity (pilocarpine HCL ophthalmic 1.25%) was approved for the treatment of presbyopia in October 2021. Previous case series have reported the presence of vitreofoveal traction and retinal detachment following pilocarpine administration, but this was not reported in the recent randomized control trials assessing the efficacy of Vuity. The authors report a case of a woman of 65 years who developed vitreomacular traction immediately following the first administration of Vuity, review the literature, and present considerations regarding screening and management of patients starting Vuity.
