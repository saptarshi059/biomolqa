BACKGROUND: The effects of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke but who have no evidence of complete occlusion of large or medium-sized vessels have not been extensively studied. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in China, we enrolled patients with ischemic stroke without occlusion of large or medium-sized vessels and with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 5 or more and at least one moderately to severely weak limb. Eligible patients had any of four clinical presentations: ineligible for thrombolysis or thrombectomy and within 24 hours after the patient was last known to be well; progression of stroke symptoms 24 to 96 hours after onset; early neurologic deterioration after thrombolysis; or thrombolysis with no improvement at 4 to 24 hours. Patients were assigned to receive intravenous tirofiban (plus oral placebo) or oral aspirin (100 mg per day, plus intravenous placebo) for 2 days; all patients then received oral aspirin until day 90. The primary efficacy end point was an excellent outcome, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. Secondary end points included functional independence at 90 days and a quality-of-life score. The primary safety end points were death and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 606 patients were assigned to the tirofiban group and 571 to the aspirin group. Most patients had small infarctions that were presumed to be atherosclerotic. The percentage of patients with a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 29.1% with tirofiban and 22.2% with aspirin (adjusted risk ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.53, P = 0.02). Results for secondary end points were generally not consistent with the results of the primary analysis. Mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 1.0% in the tirofiban group and 0% in the aspirin group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving heterogeneous groups of patients with stroke of recent onset or progression of stroke symptoms and nonoccluded large and medium-sized cerebral vessels, intravenous tirofiban was associated with a greater likelihood of an excellent outcome than low-dose aspirin. Incidences of intracranial hemorrhages were low but slightly higher with tirofiban.

IMPORTANCE: Evidence supports using antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, neurological deterioration remains common under the currently recommended antiplatelet regimen, leading to poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intravenous tirofiban administered within 24 hours of stroke onset prevents early neurological deterioration in patients with acute noncardioembolic stroke compared with oral aspirin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment was conducted at 10 comprehensive stroke centers in China between September 2020 and March 2023. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 80 years with acute noncardioembolic stroke within 24 hours of onset and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 4 to 20. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive intravenous tirofiban or oral aspirin for 72 hours using a central, web-based, computer-generated randomization schedule; all patients then received oral aspirin. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary efficacy outcome was early neurological deterioration (increase in NIHSS score >/=4 points) within 72 hours after randomization. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 72 hours after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 425 patients were included in the intravenous tirofiban (n = 213) or oral aspirin (n = 212) groups. Median (IQR) age was 64.0 years (56.0-71.0); 124 patients (29.2%) were female, and 301 (70.8%) were male. Early neurological deterioration occurred in 9 patients (4.2%) in the tirofiban group and 28 patients (13.2%) in the aspirin group (adjusted relative risk, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.65; P = .002). No patients in the tirofiban group experienced intracerebral hemorrhage. At 90-day follow-up, 3 patients (1.3%) in the tirofiban group and 3 (1.5%) in the aspirin group died (adjusted RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.27-8.54; P = .63), and the median (IQR) modified Rankin scale scores were 1.0 (0-1.25) and 1.0 (0-2), respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.90-1.83; P = .17). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with noncardioembolic stroke who were seen within 24 hours of symptom onset, tirofiban decreased the risk of early neurological deterioration but did not increase the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or systematic bleeding.

IMPORTANCE: Tirofiban is a highly selective nonpeptide antagonist of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, which reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation. It remains uncertain whether intravenous tirofiban is effective to improve functional outcomes for patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular thrombectomy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and adverse events of intravenous tirofiban before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was implemented at 55 hospitals in China, enrolling 948 patients with stroke and proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known well. Recruitment took place between October 10, 2018, and October 31, 2021, with final follow-up on January 15, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received intravenous tirofiban (n = 463) or placebo (n = 485) prior to endovascular thrombectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was disability level at 90 days as measured by overall distribution of the modified Rankin Scale scores from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). The primary safety outcome was the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours. RESULTS: Among 948 patients randomized (mean age, 67 years; 391 [41.2%] women), 948 (100%) completed the trial. The median (IQR) 90-day modified Rankin Scale score in the tirofiban group vs placebo group was 3 (1-4) vs 3 (1-4). The adjusted common odds ratio for a lower level of disability with tirofiban vs placebo was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36). Incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 9.7% in the tirofiban group vs 6.4% in the placebo group (difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -0.2% to 6.8%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular thrombectomy, treatment with intravenous tirofiban, compared with placebo, before endovascular therapy resulted in no significant difference in disability severity at 90 days. The findings do not support use of intravenous tirofiban before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.

Tirofiban is a small non-peptide ligand-mimetic Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor which can reversibly bind to the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) recognition site of GP IIb/IIIa to prevent platelet aggregation. It reduces the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Although generally considered safe, tirofiban has been reported to be associated with thrombocytopenia in several case reports and clinical trials. The pathogenesis for this adverse reaction is not entirely understood, is thought to be due to immune-mediated reaction. This side effect caused by tirofiban is especially concerning given how frequently it is used in the practice of contemporary cardiovascular care. The present review provides an overview of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, management, and risk factors associated with tirofiban-induced thrombocytopenia.
Background and Purpose- This study aimed to explore safety of tirofiban in endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Methods- Two hundred eighteen ischemic stroke patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy were prospectively recruited, with 94 treated with intra-arterial tirofiban and 124 were not. The 2 groups were compared in terms of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and fatal ICH rate by the chi(2) test and logistic regression. Results- Patients treated with tirofiban compared with those without tirofiban had significantly higher rate of symptomatic ICH (14.6% versus 5.7%; P=0.027) and fatal ICH (8.8% versus 1.6%; P=0.014). Tirofiban-treated patients had increased odds of symptomatic ICH by 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.1-7.5), and odds of fatal ICH increased by 5.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2-28.4). Conclusions- Tirofiban treatment increases risk of major ICH after endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke in this nonrandomized study.
