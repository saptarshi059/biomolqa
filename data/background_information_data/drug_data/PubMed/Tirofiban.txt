Pregnancy-associated acute myocardial infarction is a rare condition usually occurring during the third trimester of pregnancy, and associated with three-to-four-fold higher mortality compared with rates among non-pregnant women of the same age. As in non-pregnant women, in cases of ST elevation myocardial infarction, the most effective treatment is primary percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. Unfortunately, management of these patients could be challenging because little is known about the optimal medical strategy; the potential teratogenic effects of the third generation thienopyridines are not fully established too. In fact current guidelines do not provide enough recommendations about tailoring dual antiplatelet therapy prescription according to ischemic profile of the pregnant patients. Moreover, the bleeding risk class of cesarean delivery/hysterectomy is not stated in current consensus documents. We report the second pregnancy-associated acute myocardial infarction case successfully treated with ticagrelor before and after primary percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stent implantation on left coronary artery, but also the first report on use of bridging antiplatelet therapy with tirofiban during temporary withdrawal of ticagrelor because of a C-section.
BACKGROUND: The effects of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke but who have no evidence of complete occlusion of large or medium-sized vessels have not been extensively studied. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in China, we enrolled patients with ischemic stroke without occlusion of large or medium-sized vessels and with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 5 or more and at least one moderately to severely weak limb. Eligible patients had any of four clinical presentations: ineligible for thrombolysis or thrombectomy and within 24 hours after the patient was last known to be well; progression of stroke symptoms 24 to 96 hours after onset; early neurologic deterioration after thrombolysis; or thrombolysis with no improvement at 4 to 24 hours. Patients were assigned to receive intravenous tirofiban (plus oral placebo) or oral aspirin (100 mg per day, plus intravenous placebo) for 2 days; all patients then received oral aspirin until day 90. The primary efficacy end point was an excellent outcome, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. Secondary end points included functional independence at 90 days and a quality-of-life score. The primary safety end points were death and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 606 patients were assigned to the tirofiban group and 571 to the aspirin group. Most patients had small infarctions that were presumed to be atherosclerotic. The percentage of patients with a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 29.1% with tirofiban and 22.2% with aspirin (adjusted risk ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.53, P = 0.02). Results for secondary end points were generally not consistent with the results of the primary analysis. Mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 1.0% in the tirofiban group and 0% in the aspirin group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving heterogeneous groups of patients with stroke of recent onset or progression of stroke symptoms and nonoccluded large and medium-sized cerebral vessels, intravenous tirofiban was associated with a greater likelihood of an excellent outcome than low-dose aspirin. Incidences of intracranial hemorrhages were low but slightly higher with tirofiban.

BACKGROUND: Approximately half of patients who achieve successful reperfusion do not achieve functional independence. The present study sought to investigate the clinical outcomes and safety of intraarterial or intravenous tirofiban as adjunct therapy in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion who had achieved successful recanalization with endovascular treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the national, prospective BASILAR (Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion Study) registry, 458 patients who met inclusion criteria were divided into 3 groups based on tirofiban administration (no tirofiban, n=262; intravenous tirofiban, n=101; intraarterial+intravenous tirofiban, n=95). Their clinical outcomes were compared with 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were obtained by logistic regression models and propensity score matching. Safety outcomes included any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), symptomatic ICH, and mortality. Among 458 included patients, 184 (40.2%) achieved a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-3). There were no differences between the intravenous tirofiban group and the no tirofiban group in terms of safety and clinical outcomes (all P>0.05). Compared with the no tirofiban group, the intraarterial+intravenous tirofiban group had higher odds of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 3 (aOR, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.30-4.64], P=0.006) and lower 3-month mortality (aOR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.19-0.71], P=0.002) without an increase in any ICH (aOR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.09-1.01], P=0.07) or symptomatic ICH (aOR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.03-0.90], P=0.05). Similar results of intraarterial+intravenous tirofiban on improving clinical outcomes were detected in novel cohorts constructed by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial+intravenous rather than intravenous tirofiban improved clinical outcomes without increasing the frequency of symptomatic ICH among patients with basilar artery occlusion after successful endovascular treatment. Further studies are needed to delineate the roles of intraarterial+intravenous tirofiban in patients with basilar artery occlusion receiving endovascular treatment.
BACKGROUND: About 30 % of stroke patients have experienced unsuccessful reperfusion following endovascular therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy instruments may contribute to this by stimulating platelet aggregation. Tirofiban is a selective and rapidly activated antagonist of the platelets nonpeptide glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors that can reversibly suppress platelet aggregation. But, data from the medical literature are conflicting regarding its safety and efficacy for stroke patients. Hence, this study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in stroke patients. METHODS: Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library) were searched till December 2022. The Cochrane tool was used for risk of bias assessment, and the RevMan 5.4 was utilized for data analysis. RESULTS: Seven RCTs with 2088 stroke patients were included. Tirofiban significantly increased the number of patients with mRS 0 score after 90 days than control; RR= 1.39, 95 %CI [1.15, 1.69]; p = 0.0006. Additionally, it reduced the NIHSS score after seven days; MD= -0.60, 95 %CI [-1.14, -0.06]; p = 0.03. However, tirofiban increased the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH); RR= 1.22, 95 %CI [1.03, 1.44]; p = 0.02. Other assessed outcomes showed insignificant results. CONCLUSIONS: Tirofiban was associated with a higher mRS 0 score after three months and a lower NIHSS score after seven days. However, it is associated with higher ICH. Multicentric trials are required to provide more convincing proof of its utility.
BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists such as tirofiban are beneficial for patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, it is still uncertain about the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: In this prospective non-randomized study, 255 AIS patients were recruited from 4 comprehensive stroke centers in China between January, 2017 and May, 2018. Among them,169 patients were treated with aspirin plus clopidogrel and 86 patients were treated with tirofiban. The primary functional outcome was the distribution of the 90 days' modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The safety outcomes included the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) at discharge and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS: In the propensity score matched cohort, tirofiban alone was noninferior to the dual antiplatelet with regard to the primary outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 2.04; P = 0.93). Mortality at 90 days was 10% in the dual antiplatelet group and 8% in the tirofiban group (adjusted odds ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.08 to 7.40, p = 0.81). There was no difference of the ICH rate between two groups (adjusted odds ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.48, p = 0.18). In the inverse probability of treatment weighting-propensity score-adjusted cohort, similar differences were found for functional and safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that tirofiban use appears to be safe as monotherapy in AIS treatment compared with common dual antiplatelet therapy, however, no improvement in functional outcomes was found.

Anti-GPIIb/IIIa associated thrombocytopenia has been reported in most large trials, but very little data is available regarding tirofiban. We report three cases of thrombocytopenia, most likely attributed to tirofiban (two moderate and one severe). For each patient, laboratory investigation has allowed us to exclude another cause of thrombocytopenia, particularly heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Platelet count recovery could be earlier with tirofiban than with abciximab. Some suggestions are proposed for practical management of these patients with persistent thrombotic risk, who are sometimes candidates for cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of preoperative versus intraoperative tirofiban in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA). METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study based on the RESCUE-RE (Registration Study for Critical Care of Acute Ischemic Stroke After Recanalization) trial enrolling patients with anterior circulation LVO classified as LAA within 24 h of onset. Patients were divided into three groups: preoperative tirofiban (PT), intraoperative tirofiban (IT), and no tirofiban (NT). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline characteristics. The efficacy outcomes included 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score = 0-2) and early partial recanalization (EPR; defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score = 1-2a). The safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). RESULTS: A total of 104 matched triplets were obtained through PSM. Compared with NT, PT increased 90-day functional independence (60.8% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.008) and EPR (42.7% vs. 18.3%, p < 0.001) rate, with a tendency to increase the asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (aICH) proportion (28.8% vs. 18.3%, p = 0.072). Compared with IT, PT had a higher 90-day functional independence (60.8% vs. 45.2%, p = 0.025) and EPR (42.7% vs. 20.2%, p = 0.001) rate, with no significant difference in sICH (14.4% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.122) and aICH (28.8% vs. 21.2%, p = 0.200). Compared with NT, IT had a lower 90-day mortality rate (9.6% vs. 24.0%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Tirofiban shows good adjuvant therapy potential in acute ischemic stroke-LVO due to LAA patients. PT is associated with higher rates of EPR and better therapeutic efficacy. In addition, EPR may be a potential way to improve prognosis.
IMPORTANCE: Evidence supports using antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, neurological deterioration remains common under the currently recommended antiplatelet regimen, leading to poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intravenous tirofiban administered within 24 hours of stroke onset prevents early neurological deterioration in patients with acute noncardioembolic stroke compared with oral aspirin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment was conducted at 10 comprehensive stroke centers in China between September 2020 and March 2023. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 80 years with acute noncardioembolic stroke within 24 hours of onset and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 4 to 20. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive intravenous tirofiban or oral aspirin for 72 hours using a central, web-based, computer-generated randomization schedule; all patients then received oral aspirin. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary efficacy outcome was early neurological deterioration (increase in NIHSS score >/=4 points) within 72 hours after randomization. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 72 hours after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 425 patients were included in the intravenous tirofiban (n = 213) or oral aspirin (n = 212) groups. Median (IQR) age was 64.0 years (56.0-71.0); 124 patients (29.2%) were female, and 301 (70.8%) were male. Early neurological deterioration occurred in 9 patients (4.2%) in the tirofiban group and 28 patients (13.2%) in the aspirin group (adjusted relative risk, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.65; P = .002). No patients in the tirofiban group experienced intracerebral hemorrhage. At 90-day follow-up, 3 patients (1.3%) in the tirofiban group and 3 (1.5%) in the aspirin group died (adjusted RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.27-8.54; P = .63), and the median (IQR) modified Rankin scale scores were 1.0 (0-1.25) and 1.0 (0-2), respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.90-1.83; P = .17). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with noncardioembolic stroke who were seen within 24 hours of symptom onset, tirofiban decreased the risk of early neurological deterioration but did not increase the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or systematic bleeding.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in pregnancy is rare and has a high mortality rate of 37-50%. The most important risk factors are advanced maternal age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Although thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery by-pass grafting can be performed, primary PTCA and antiplatelet agents have recently improved prognosis. We here present a case of AMI in a 43 year old woman in the 20th week of pregnancy treated successfully with aspirin, clopidogrel and intracoronary stenting without any complications.
Tirofiban is a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Thrombocytopenia is a well-known complication of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. Life-threatening complications such as alveolar and gastrointestinal system hemorrhages may occur in the course of thrombocytopenia. Platelet count should be monitored closely, including during the first few hours of the infusion. Adverse events may be prevented by prompt discontinuation of the therapy. Herein we present two cases of profound and sudden thrombocytopenia associated with tirofiban use in the treatment of ACS together with a review of the literature.
BACKGROUND Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a clinical entity with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances and variety of its management, there is still no criterion standard treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of tirofiban use on the early and 6-month prognosis of patients with knee and below-knee arterial thrombosis who were treated with percutaneous thrombosuction (PT) within 24 h. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data of consecutive ALI patients who were diagnosed with popliteal and infra-popliteal arterial thrombosis and underwent PT procedure within 24 h between January 2010 and September 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were separated into 2 groups according to tirofiban usage. RESULTS A total of 105 patients (mean age 67+/-16; 53% men) were included in the study. Atrial fibrillation (n 64, 61%) and hypertension (n 60, 57%) were the most frequent comorbidities in patients with thromboembolic events. A significantly higher rate of distal embolization (6% vs. 16%; p=0.01) and slow-flow (17% vs. 30%; p<0.01) developed in patients who were not treated with tirofiban after the PT procedure. Although major and minor bleeding were more frequent in the tirofiban group, only the rate minor bleeding was statistically significant (29% vs. 9%, p=0.001). Reverse embolic event ratio was similar in both groups. Although there was a higher rate of amputation in patients not treated with tirofiban, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS Adding tirofiban to PT reduces angiographic thromboembolic complications. Usage of tirofiban in patients prone to thromboembolic events may be useful for improving success of the PT procedure, with a reasonable bleeding ratio.
BACKGROUND: In-stent thrombosis after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) worsen outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to tandem lesions (TL). Although an optimal antiplatelet therapy is needed, the best approach to avoid in-stent thrombosis is yet to be elucidated. HYPOTHESIS: Low-dose intravenous tirofiban is superior to intravenous aspirin in avoiding in-stent thrombosis in patients undergoing MT plus carotid stenting in the setting of AIS due to TL. METHODS: The ATILA-trial is a multicenter, prospective, phase IV, randomized, controlled (aspirin group as control), assessor-blinded clinical trial. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria (AIS due to TL, ASPECTS ⩾ 6, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale ⩽2 and onset <24 h) will be randomized (1:1) at MT onset to experimental (intravenous tirofiban) or control group (intravenous aspirin). Intravenous aspirin will be administered at a 500 mg single dose and tirofiban at a 500 microg bolus followed by a 200 microg/h infusion during first 22 h. All patients will be followed up to 3 months. Sample size estimated is 240 patients. OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy outcome is the proportion of patients with carotid in-stent thrombosis within the first 24 h after MT. The primary safety outcome is the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes include functional independence defined as modified Rankin Scale 0-2, proportion of patients undergoing rescue therapy due to in-stent aggregation during MT and carotid reocclusion at 30 days. DISCUSSION: ATILA-trial will be the first clinical trial regarding the best antiplatelet therapy to avoid in-stent thrombosis after MT in patients with TL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT0522596.
BACKGROUND: Tirofiban is an antiplatelet treatment approved for acute coronary syndrome, but it has not been rigorously evaluated for efficacy and safety in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies conducted from January 1, 2015, to July 31, 2021, that evaluated tirofiban administration for patients with AIS treated with EVT in comparison with control. Risk ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for favorable functional outcomes (FFOs), mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), each 90 days after AIS. Bayesian hierarchical modeling was performed to obtain posterior RR and its 95% highest posterior density (HPD) for validation. RESULTS: Compared with controls, tirofiban users exhibited increased FFOs (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30), decreased mortality (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92), and no difference in SICH (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.23). Tirofiban users in the postbolus infusion subgroup exhibited increased FFOs (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.35), decreased mortality (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.88), and no increase in SICH (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.72-1.29). The bolus-only subgroup showed no differences in FFO, mortality, or SICH between the tirofiban and control groups. Consistent results were obtained for posterior density of FFO (posterior RR, 1.20; 95% HPD, 1.06-1.34), mortality (posterior RR, 0.77; 95% HPD, 0.63-0.92), and SICH (posterior RR, 0.98; 95% HPD, 0.71-1.26). CONCLUSION: For patients with AIS treated with EVT, tirofiban improved FFOs, decreased mortality, and did not increase SICH compared with controls; postbolus infusion for administering tirofiban was more favored than the bolus-only regimen.
OBJECTIVE: In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to compare the efficacy and safety of tirofiban administered in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with or without mechanical thrombectomy (MT). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published between 2001 and 2021 that provided outcomes of AIS patients who underwent IVT alone or IVT bridging with or without tirofiban. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days. The secondary outcomes included the rates of (1) an excellent outcome defined as a mRS score of 0 or 1 at 90 days, (2) any type of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), (3) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), (4) mortality, and (5) successful recanalization. RESULTS: We included 722 patients with IVT bridging therapy in 3 trials; there were 171 patients in the tirofiban group and 551 patients in the nontirofiban group. We included 846 patients with IVT alone in 7 studies; there were 471 patients in the tirofiban group and 375 patients in the nontirofiban group. The patients treated with tirofiban had a reduced risk of mortality compared to the patients treated without tirofiban during IVT bridging (OR, 0.46; 95 % CI, 0.24-0.89; p = 0.02), but no significant differences were found in safety outcomes on sICH, ICH, recanalization or efficacy outcomes on modified Rankin scale 0-2 (p > 0.05). Pooled results showed that tirofiban combined with IVT alone did not increase the risks of sICH, ICH or mortality but was significantly associated with excellent (OR, 2.68; 95 % CI, 1.58-4.55; P = 0.0003) and favorable (OR, 2.36; 95 % CI, 1.58-3.52; p < 0.0001) functional outcomes at 90 days. CONCLUSION: In AIS patients who underwent IVT or bridging therapy, early administration of tirofiban may be effective and safe, but further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy.
BACKGROUND: The use of tirofiban as an adjunct to endovascular therapy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke has been controversial. We aimed to assess the differences in safety and efficacy of EVT adjuvant to tirofiban in patients with anterior circulation stroke (ACS) and posterior circulation stroke (PCS). METHODS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials that compared treatment with tirofiban combined with EVT and EVT alone were included in our meta-analysis. The safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 3-month mortality. The efficacy outcomes were good functional outcome, excellent functional outcome, and successful recanalization (mTICI >/= 2b). We performed subgroup analyses of anterior and posterior circulation strokes. RESULTS: We included 15 studies with 4608 patients. For safety outcomes, tirofiban significantly reduced 3-month mortality in the ACS subgroup (odd ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65-0.98, P = .03) without increasing the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.88-1.44, P = .35). In the PCS subgroup, tirofiban significantly reduced 3-month mortality (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.50-0.80, P = .0001) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37-0.95, P = .03). For efficacy outcomes, in the ACS subgroup, tirofiban significantly improved good functional outcome (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.45, P = .008) but did not improve recanalization (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.93-1.47, P = .17) and excellent functional outcome (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.97-1.46, P = .10). In the PCS subgroup, tirofiban significantly improved recanalization rate (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.43-2.65, P < .0001) and did not improve good functional outcome (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.81-1.30, P = .81) and excellent functional outcome (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.58-1.20, P = .34). CONCLUSION: In acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing EVT, tirofiban improves good functional outcomes in ACS patients and increases recanalization rates in PCS patients on the 1 hand, reduces mortality, and does not increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage on the other. Tirofiban is safe and effective in both anterior circulation stroke and posterior circulation stroke patients undergoing EVT. More large multicentre randomized controlled studies are needed in the future.
Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) have been part of the adjuvant treatment of acute coronary syndrome for years. However, real-life data regarding the efficacy and safety of GPIs under the current indications are lacking in the setting of potent platelet inhibition. The objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of abciximab versus tirofiban in patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and pretreated with ticagrelor, and to identify independent predictor factors of efficacy, bleeding and platelet drop. Three hundred sixty-two patients were divided by GPI administered. Clinical, laboratory, angiographic and outcome characteristics were compared. The primary objective was a composite efficacy endpoint (death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke) at 30 days. The secondary objectives were its individual components, safety (bleeding) and the impact on platelet count during hospital stay. The composite efficacy endpoint was similar in the abciximab and tirofiban groups (6.1% vs 7.3%; p = .632). There were also no differences in cardiovascular death (2.5% vs 2.4%; p = .958), nonfatal myocardial infarction (3% vs 4.3%; p = .521) and nonfatal stroke (0.5% vs 1.8%; p = .332). Tirofiban administration was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding (11.6% vs 22%; p = .008) with no differences in BARC >/= 3b bleeding (3.6 vs 2.5%; p = .760). In STEMI patients undergoing PPCI with ticagrelor, abciximab and tirofiban had similar rates in the composite efficacy endpoint at 30 days. The 30-day bleeding rate was significantly higher in the tirofiban group. Tirofiban administration was an independent predictor of both bleeding and platelet count drop.
BACKGROUND: Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were the strongest available antiplatelet therapy and have been shown to reduce cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, evidences are still lacking on the superiority of eptifibatide over tirofiban or vice versa in patients with acute coronary syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of eptifibatide and tirofiban used among patients with acute coronary syndrome by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Pubmed, Ovid/Medline, Ovid/Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, CBM and CNKI to identify randomized controlled trials comparing eptifibatide with tirofiban for acute coronary syndrome until November 2015. The methodological quality was assessed with the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. RESULTS: 1256 patients from 9 randomized controlled trials were finally included. Compared with tirofiban, eptifibatide could reduce more risk of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction minor bleeding (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.38, 0.98). However, no significant differences were observed for major adverse cardiac events (RR 0.41, 95%CI 0.15 to 1.12), major bleeding, thrombocytopenia in the two treatment groups. The relative treatment benefits were similar in subgroups of patients according to types of acute coronary syndrome, or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. CONCLUSION: Available evidence suggests that the safety of eptifibatide is slightly superior to tirofiban in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but no significant difference was observed on efficacy. Future studies should focus on the randomized controlled trials with larger sample, multi-center, long-term follow-up, high quality to compare the two drugs.
BACKGROUND: Standard administration of newer oral P2Y(12) inhibitors, including prasugrel or ticagrelor, provides suboptimal early inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We aimed to investigate the effects of cangrelor, tirofiban, and prasugrel, administered as chewed or integral loading dose, on IPA in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: The FABOLUS-FASTER trial (Facilitation Through Aggrastat or Cangrelor Bolus and Infusion Over Prasugrel: A Multicenter Randomized Open-Label Trial in Patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Referred for Primary Percutaneous Intervention) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized study. A total of 122 P2Y(12)-naive patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to cangrelor (n=40), tirofiban (n=40) (both administered as bolus and 2-hour infusion followed by 60 mg of prasugrel), or 60-mg loading dose of prasugrel (n=42). The latter group underwent an immediate 1:1 subrandomization to chewed (n=21) or integral (n=21) tablets administration. The trial was powered to test 3 hypotheses (noninferiority of cangrelor compared with tirofiban using a noninferiority margin of 9%, superiority of both tirofiban and cangrelor compared with chewed prasugrel, and superiority of chewed prasugrel as compared with integral prasugrel, each with alpha=0.016 for the primary end point, which was 30-minute IPA at light transmittance aggregometry in response to 20 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate. RESULTS: At 30 minutes, cangrelor did not satisfy noninferiority compared with tirofiban, which yielded superior IPA over cangrelor (95.0+/-8.9 versus 34.1+/-22.5; P<0.001). Cangrelor or tirofiban were both superior to chewed prasugrel (IPA, 10.5+/-11.0; P<0.001 for both comparisons), which did not provide higher IPA over integral prasugrel (6.3+/-11.4; P=0.47), despite yielding higher prasugrel active metabolite concentration (ng/mL; 62.3+/-82.6 versus 17.1+/-43.5; P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Cangrelor provided inferior IPA compared with tirofiban; both treatments yielded greater IPA compared with chewed prasugrel, which led to higher active metabolite concentration but not greater IPA compared with integral prasugrel.

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the safety and efficacy of tirofiban for patients with large vessel occlusion stroke after intravenous thrombolysis. METHODS: This study data was from SUSTAIN, DEVT, and RESCUE BT trials. According to whether the use of tirofiban who underwent endovascular treatment and preceding intravenous thrombolysis was divided into the tirofiban group and the no-tirofiban group. The safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, any intracranial hemorrhage within 48 h, and 3-month mortality. The efficacy outcome was defined as a score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin Scale scores at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 372 patients with intravenous thrombolysis were included in these SUSTAIN, DEVT, and RESCUE BT trials. Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that tirofiban with intravenous thrombolysis was not associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (aOR, 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.49-1.57; P=0.65), any intracranial hemorrhage within 48 h (aOR, 1.00; 95 % CI, 0.60-1.66; P=1.00), 3-month mortality (aOR, 1.10; 95 % CI, 0.56-2.19; P=0.78) and 3-month modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2 (aOR, 0.72; 95 % CI, 0.42-1.25; P=0.25) in patients with acute large vessel occlusion. In the subgroup analysis, we found that tirofiban was not recommended for females (aOR, 0.34; 95 % CI, 0.12-0.93), baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score</=9 (aOR, 0.37; 95 % CI, 0.18-0.76), and cardiogenic embolism (aOR, 0.36; 95 % CI, 0.14-0.97). CONCLUSION: Tirofiban combined with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute large vessel occlusion may be safe. Further studies need to confirm the effectiveness of tirofiban after intravenous thrombolysis in different stroke etiology.
To review the literature for randomized control trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies investigating the safety and efficacy of tirofiban and eptifibatide in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched for available papers published up to September 2021. The efficacy was evaluated based on the 3-month favorable outcome [modified Rankin scale (mRS) = 0-1], functional outcome (mRS = 0-2), and the last available National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score measured in each study. Twelve studies (two RCTs and 10 prospective cohorts) and 2926 patients were included. Treatment with tirofiban or eptifibatide had no effects on the favorable outcome (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.89-1.35, P = 0.411), functional outcome (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.98-1.28, P = 0.010), and last available NIHSS (WMD = - 2.32, 95% CI - 5.14 to 0.50, P = 0.106), but might increase mortality (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-0.99, P = 0.121). The sensitivity analyses showed that the meta-analyses were robust. There was no significant publication bias. Tirofiban did not increase the risk of ICH (P = 0. 423) and sICH (P = 0. 990) but increased the risk of fatal ICH (RR = 3.59, 95% CI 1.62-7.96, P = 0.002). Thrombolysis/thrombectomy did not influence any of the outcomes. Adding tirofiban or eptifibatide to thrombolysis/thrombectomy was not significantly associated with a favorable outcome (mRS = 0-1) nor functional outcome (mRS = 0-2) in patients with AIS at 3 months, but might be associated with mortality, possibly due to fatal ICH. The NIHSS was also not significantly different between the intervention and control groups after treatments.
