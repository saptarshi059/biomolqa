Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a multifactorial nosological entity that increases neonatal mortality as a result of heart failure. Pulmonary vasodilators are the cornerstone of treatment, of which sildenafil is the most commonly used drug. Therefore, the results of a recently updated Cochrane systematic review are summarized, in which the efficacy and safety of sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates was evaluated.
AIMS: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major care problem worldwide. Tadalafil and sildenafil are the two most common phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat ED. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to directly compare tadalafil with sildenafil for the treatment of ED. METHODS: We designed a strategy for searching the PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases; the reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated. A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized or non-randomized controlled trials that compared tadalafil with sildenafil for the treatment of ED and to assess the quality of the studies. Two investigators independently and blindly screened the studies for inclusion. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0. RESULTS: A total of 16 trials that compared tadalafil with sildenafil for the treatment of ED were included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, tadalafil and sildenafil appeared to have similar efficacies and overall adverse event rates. However, compared with sildenafil, tadalafil significantly improved psychological outcomes. Furthermore, the patients and their partners preferred tadalafil over sildenafil, and no significant difference was found in the adherence and persistence rates between tadalafil and sildenafil. Additionally, the myalgia and back pain rates were higher and the flushing rate was lower with tadalafil than with sildenafil. CONCLUSION: Tadalafil shares a similar efficacy and safety with sildenafil and significantly improves patients' sexual confidence. Furthermore, patients and their partners prefer tadalafil to sildenafil. Hence, tadalafil may be a better choice for ED treatment.
BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease needing effective therapeutics urgently. Sildenafil, one of the approved phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, has been implicated as having potential effect in AD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of sildenafil on AD. METHODS: We performed real-world patient data analysis using the MarketScan(R) Medicare Supplemental and the Clinformatics(R) databases. We conducted propensity score-stratified analyses after adjusting confounding factors (i.e., sex, age, race, and comorbidities). We used both familial and sporadic AD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived neurons to evaluate the sildenafil's mechanism-of-action. RESULTS: We showed that sildenafil usage is associated with reduced likelihood of AD across four new drug compactor cohorts, including bumetanide, furosemide, spironolactone, and nifedipine. For instance, sildenafil usage is associated with a 54% reduced incidence of AD in MarketScan(R) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.46, 95% CI 0.32- 0.66) and a 30% reduced prevalence of AD in Clinformatics(R) (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.49- 1.00) compared to spironolactone. We found that sildenafil treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation (pTau181 and pTau205) in a dose-dependent manner in both familial and sporadic AD patient iPSC-derived neurons. RNA-sequencing data analysis of sildenafil-treated AD patient iPSC-derived neurons reveals that sildenafil specifically target AD related genes and pathobiological pathways, mechanistically supporting the beneficial effect of sildenafil in AD. CONCLUSIONS: These real-world patient data validation and mechanistic observations from patient iPSC-derived neurons further suggested that sildenafil is a potential repurposable drug for AD. Yet, randomized clinical trials are warranted to validate the causal treatment effects of sildenafil in AD.
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem with a multifactorial aetiology. The treatment of ED has been revolutionised by the introduction of intracavernosal injections some two decades ago. However, the recent development of the orally-administered drug sildenafil (Viagra) has had a major impact on the treatment of ED. We discuss the trials with sildenafil with special reference to cardiovascular risk factors associated with ED.
Some of the highest rates of erectile dysfunction are seen in patients with renal failure, especially those on dialysis. The treatment of erectile dysfunction has been revolutionized in the last decade by the introduction of sildenafil. The literature on sildenafil in dialysis patients is here reviewed. Sildenafil seems to be both safe and effective in the treatment of sexual dysfunction in the dialysis population.
