Rosacea is a chronic cutaneous disorder affecting primarily the face, characterized by erythema, transient or persistent, telangiectasia, and inflammatory lesions including papulo-pustules and swelling. The essential component of the disease is the persistent erythema of facial skin. Episodes of flushing (acute-subacute intermittent vasodilation) are common. Swelling and erythema of the nose along with dilatation of the pilosebaceous poral orifices, known as rhinophyma, can be noted in chronic cases. Rosacea affects up to 10% of the world population and is especially noted in fair-skinned individuals aged 35-50. Women are affected more often than men. Several treatment modalities including topical medications, systemic drugs, lasers, and light-based therapies have been used for the management of rosacea with variable results. Topical medications such as azelaic acid, metronidazole, and sulfacetamide/sulfur, oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines, and oral retinoids alone or, most commonly, in combination form the mainstay of treatment. Light therapies such as intense pulsed light and pulsed dye laser are best used for the erythemato-telangiectatic type. Topical brimonidine, oxymetazoline, ivermectin, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, low-dose modified-release tetracyclines and botulinum toxin are the new additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. This article provides a comprehensive review of the various therapies used for rosacea.
Remdesivir, marketed under the brand name Veklury, is an antiviral drug with a broad spectrum of activity. There were various countries where the use of Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 was authorized during the pandemic. Remdesivir was first designed to treat hepatitis C, but it was later tested for Ebola virus sickness and Marburg virus infections. Remdesivir is a prodrug designed to facilitate the intracellular transport of GS-441524 monophosphate and its subsequent biotransformation into GS-441524 triphosphate, a ribonucleotide analogue inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. The objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive review of Remdesivir (GS-5734), including its nomenclature, physiochemical properties, preparation methods, identification procedures, numerous qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques, ADME profiles, and pharmacological effects. In addition, the chapter provides a variety of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques for separating brimonidine from other drugs in combination formulations.
The diagnosis and classification of rosacea has been modified to reflect presenting features. On exclusion of differentials, the diagnosis of rosacea is based on the presence of either (1) phymatous changes, or (2) centrofacial persistent erythema. In their absence, diagnosis can be established by presence of any two of: flushing/transient erythema, papules and pustules, telangiectases, or ocular manifestations. Management of rosacea depends on presenting feature(s), their severity, and impact. General management includes gentle skin care, sun protection, and trigger avoidance. Evidence-based treatment recommendations include topical brimonidine and oxymetazoline for persistent erythema; topical azelaic acid, ivermectin, metronidazole, minocycline and oral doxycycline, tetracycline and isotretinoin for papules and pustules; vascular lasers and light devices for telangiectases; and omega-3 fatty acids and cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. While surgical or laser therapy can be considered for clinically noninflamed phyma, there are no trials on their utility. Combination therapies include topical brimonidine with topical ivermectin, or topical metronidazole with oral doxycycline. Topical metronidazole, topical ivermectin, and topical azelaic acid are appropriate for maintenance therapy. In conclusion, the updated phenotype approach, based on presenting clinical features, is the foundation for current diagnosis, classification, and treatment of rosacea.
CLINICAL QUESTION: Which interventions are associated with highest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating rosacea? BOTTOM LINE: There is high-quality evidence that topical brimonidine, azelaic acid, and ivermectin, as well as oral doxycycline and isotretinoin, are associated with improvements in rosacea. Lower-quality evidence is available for topical metronidazole, oral tetracycline, laser and light-based therapy, and topical cyclosporine for ocular rosacea. Most treatments are not associated with higher adverse event rates than placebo.
Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder involving central facial erythema secondary to vascular instability and cutaneous inflammation. Rosacea is divided into different subtypes based on the morphology of the rash &mdash; erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular rosacea. A less-known subtype called neurogenic rosacea has been proposed to categorize patients suffering from rosacea with erythematous flushing and burning sensation that is refractory to traditional treatment. There is minimal data on this subgroup of rosacea patients and its potential treatment options. This review aims to explore current medical literature to define characteristics of neurogenic rosacea and its management. We performed a systematic search of PubMed database and identified 6 articles meeting inclusion criteria with a total of 37 patients with suspected neurogenic rosacea. Combination treatments with topicals (eg, metronidazole, brimonidine), as well as oral medications including vascular (eg, beta blockers), psychiatric (eg, diazepam, duloxetine), neurologic (eg, pregabalin, sumatriptan), and antibiotic agents (eg, rifaximin), were often cited to have better outcomes, but this finding was highly variable between patients. There were isolated reports of effective management with onabotulinumtoxinA intradermal injections and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy treatment. Current literature supports selecting agents aimed at treating the major symptom pattern (eg, erythema, telangiectasias, burning sensation). Neurogenic rosacea treatment: a literature review.
