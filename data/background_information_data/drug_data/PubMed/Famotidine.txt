OBJECTIVE: Reports that the over-the-counter histamine H(2) receptor antagonist famotidine could help treat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared from April 2020. We, therefore, examined reports on interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and histamine receptor antagonists. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed by 19 September 2020, and updated on 28 October 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar using (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (histamine antagonist OR famotidine OR cimetidine). ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and (famotidine or histamine). RESULTS: Famotidine may be a useful addition in COVID-19 treatment, but the results from prospective randomized trials are as yet awaited. Bioinformatics/drug repurposing studies indicated that, among several medicines, H(1) and H(2) receptor antagonists may interact with key viral enzymes. However, in vitro studies have to date failed to show a direct inhibition of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2 replication. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical research into the potential benefits of H(2) receptor antagonists in managing COVID-19 inflammation began from a simple observation and now is being tested in multi-centre clinical trials. The positive effects of famotidine may be due to H(2) receptor-mediated immunomodulatory actions on mast cell histamine-cytokine cross-talk, rather than a direct action on SARS-CoV-2.
Histamine-2 receptor antagonists are a class of drugs used to treat the acid-related gastrointestinal diseases such as ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Although such drugs, especially ranitidine and famotidine, are still widely used, their effects on semen quality, and hence on male infertility, is still unclear. This MiniReview systematically addresses and summarizes the effect of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine and famotidine) on semen quality, particularly, on sperm function. Cimetidine appears to have adverse effects on semen quality. While the effects of ranitidine and nizatidine on semen quality are still controversial, famotidine does not appear to change semen quality. Therefore, additional studies will be required to clarify whether histamine-2 receptor-independent effects of these drugs play a role in semen quality as well as further clinical studies including direct comparison of the histamine-2 receptor antagonists.
Central nervous system effects, such as mental confusion and hallucinations, have been reported with both cimetidine and ranitidine. Elderly patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction are more susceptible to these adverse reactions. We report two cases of reversible mental confusion in elderly patients with mild renal insufficiency following intravenous famotidine therapy, possibly explained by an increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in patients with decreased renal function.
ABSTRACT: Histamine is a biogenic amine distributed extensively in the human cells. Histamine is linked with different inflammatory and allergic disorders through promoting of chemoatractant activity and endothelial changes. Antihistamine drugs are effective in the treatment and prevention of infection of influenza H7N9 through inhibition of viral entry to the host cells. A multiplicity of search strategies including experimental, preclinical and clinical studies were taken on and assumed to review the potential role of H1, H2 or their combination in the management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Histamine release is associated with early and late pathology of Covid-19 and clinical presentation. Despite the potential effect of famotidine in attenuating the pathogenesis of Covid-19, famotidine has no direct effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, azelastine (H1receptor blocker) used for allergic rhinitis as nasal spray has potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity comparable to that of remdesivir, lopinavir and chloroquine. Azelastine is more effective than other agents that are used in the management of Covid-19 due to significant inhibition of endosomal acidification at respiratory epithelial cells. However, famotidine and cetirizine combination improve clinical outcome and reduce intubation and duration of hospitalization in Covid-19 patients. Taken together, hospitalised Covid-19 patients treated with famotidine only showed more complications as compared with those treated with combination of famotidine and cetirizine. CONCLUSIONS: Both H1 and H2 blockade are effective in the management of Covid-19 patients through antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, which together reduce the risk of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
