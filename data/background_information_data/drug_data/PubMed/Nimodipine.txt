Organophosphorus (OP) compounds remain a leading cause of self-poisoning and mortality, especially in South East Asia, China, and Africa. Organophosphorus causes an acute cholinergic syndrome by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Atropine remains the mainstay of treatment, but recently some promising therapies are in the pipeline. Oximes are used widely in the management of organophosphorus poisoning, however clinical efficacy remains to be established. Magnesium sulfate, calcium channel blockers (nimodipine), plasma alkalinizing agents, beta-2 agonists, nicotinic receptor antagonists, clonidine, and lipid emulsions are promising treatment alternatives. However, large phase III trials are required to establish their efficacy.
Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist that blocks the flux of extracellular calcium through L-type, voltage-gated calcium channels. While nimodipine is FDAapproved for the prevention and treatment of neurological deficits in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), it affects myriad cell types throughout the body, and thus, likely has more complex mechanisms of action than simple inhibition of cerebral vasoconstriction. Newer understanding of the pathophysiology of delayed ischemic injury after a variety of acute neurologic injuries including aSAH, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke, coupled with advances in the drug delivery method for nimodipine, have reignited interest in refining its potential therapeutic use. In this context, this review seeks to establish a firm understanding of current data on nimodipine's role in the mechanisms of delayed injury in aSAH, TBI, and ischemic stroke, and assess the extensive clinical data evaluating its use in these conditions. In addition, we will review pivotal trials using locally administered, sustained release nimodipine and discuss why such an approach has evaded demonstration of efficacy, while seemingly having the potential to significantly improve clinical care.
INTRODUCTION: Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that has been used to treat hypertension and vasospasm. Emerging evidence in the literature suggests that it is neuroprotective by reducing cellular apoptosis after neuronal injury and promoting axonal sprouting at the nodes of Ranvier. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the usage of nimodipine in cranial nerve injury and to perform a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of nimodipine on functional recovery of the injured cranial nerves. METHODS: Literature search was performed in eight databases using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Human studies that used nimodipine as a monotherapy for treating cranial nerve injury were included for review. Cranial nerve function recovery was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: 672 records were screened and 58 full texts in English were assessed. Nine studies were included in the final review. 5 of these, including 110 participants who received nimodipine for either recurrent laryngeal nerve or facial nerve injury and 556 controls, were used for meta-analysis. Nimodipine significantly increased the odds of vocal fold motion recovery (odds ratio [OR] 13.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.21, 30.38, P < .01), and the odds of facial motion recovery (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.20, 6.44, P = .02). Overall, nimodipine-treated patients had significantly higher odds of recovering vocal fold or facial motion compared with controls (OR 6.09, 95% CI 3.41, 10.87, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Existing evidence supports the positive effect of nimodipine on vocal fold and facial motion recovery after injury. Future research should focus on randomized clinical trials comparing recovery rates between nimodipine- and placebo-treated groups. Laryngoscope, 129:943-951, 2019.
Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of intravenous and enteral nimodipine in preventing poor outcome from delayed cerebral ischemia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. We performed a systematic search and a network meta-analysis using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar. Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess risk of bias of included studies. A ranking among methods was performed on the basis of the frequentist analog of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Published studies that met the following population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study (PICOS) criteria were included: patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage aged 15 years or older (P); nimodipine, intravenous and oral formulation (I); placebo or no intervention (C); poor outcome measured at 3 months (defined as death, vegetative state, or severe disability), case fatality at 3 months, delayed cerebral ischemia, delayed ischaemic neurologic deficit, and vasospasm measured with transcranial Doppler or digital subtraction angiography (O); and randomized controlled trials (S). No language or publication date restrictions were applied. Ten studies were finally included, with a total of 1527 randomly assigned patients. Oral and intravenous nimodipine were both effective in preventing poor outcome, delayed cerebral ischemia, and delayed ischaemic neurological deficit. Neither treatment was effective in improving case fatality. Evolving clinical protocols over a 30-year period and the risk of bias of the included studies may limit the strength of our results. Enteral and intravenous nimodipine may have a similar effectiveness in terms of preventing poor outcome, delayed cerebral ischemia, and delayed ischaemic neurological deficit. More research may be needed to fully establish the role of intravenous nimodipine in current clinical practice.
The clinical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-associated vasospasm remains a challenge in neurosurgical practice, with its prevention and treatment having a major impact on neurological outcome. While considered a mainstay, nimodipine is burdened by some non-negligible limitations that make it still a suboptimal candidate of pharmacotherapy for SAH. This narrative review aims to provide an update on the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, overall evidence, and strength of recommendation of nimodipine alternative drugs for aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. A PRISMA literature search was performed in the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PubChem databases using a combination of the MeSH terms "medical therapy," "management," "cerebral vasospasm," "subarachnoid hemorrhage," and "delayed cerebral ischemia." Collected articles were reviewed for typology and relevance prior to final inclusion. A total of 346 articles were initially collected. The identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion process resulted in the selection of 59 studies. Nicardipine and cilostazol, which have longer half-lives than nimodipine, had robust evidence of efficacy and safety. Eicosapentaenoic acid, dapsone and clazosentan showed a good balance between effectiveness and favorable pharmacokinetics. Combinations between different drug classes have been studied to a very limited extent. Nicardipine, cilostazol, Rho-kinase inhibitors, and clazosentan proved their better pharmacokinetic profiles compared with nimodipine without prejudice with effective and safe neuroprotective role. However, the number of trials conducted is significantly lower than for nimodipine. Aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm remains an area of ongoing preclinical and clinical research where the search for new drugs or associations is critical.
