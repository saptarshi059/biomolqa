BACKGROUND: Gabapentin is the most commonly preferred agent for neuropathic pain in general practice as it is usually well tolerated, but occasionally, its toxicity may occur at standard doses, especially in elderly individuals, even without any prior comorbidities. CASE: We present an elderly male with normal renal parameters, who was started on gabapentin for neuropathic pain. He developed multifocal myoclonus all over the body within few days after starting gabapentin and subsided completed after withdrawal of the drug. CONCLUSION: Acute hyperkinetic movement disorders such as multifocal or segmental myoclonus in elderly patients warrant a prompt review of recent drug history, especially gabapentin, even in the background of normal renal function.
Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug that is prescribed for both FDA-approved and multiple off-label conditions, and has a relatively safe side-effect profile. Rare cases of overdose-related adverse effects have been reported in the literature. Described herein are the circumstances and autopsy findings of a 62-year-old woman with a history of depression, whose death was caused by intentional ingestion of excess gabapentin. The postmortem peripheral blood gabapentin concentration as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy was 88 mug/mL. Previously reported cases of individuals surviving gabapentin overdoses are discussed and compared with this case. Based on a review of the available literature, this appears to be the first published report of a death due solely to gabapentin toxicity.
A review of the recent literature found that compared with placebo or other pain medications, gabapentin did not significantly reduce nonneuropathic pain. The drug also is associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions, including somnolence, dizziness, and nausea. Given the lack of efficacy and risk of adverse reactions, gabapentin should not be used for nonneuropathic pain.
The amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Four placebo-controlled studies found the GABA analog drug gabapentin effective for treating alcohol dependence. Gabapentin may also be effective for treating alcohol withdrawal syndromes. One placebo-controlled pilot study found gabapentin beneficial for cannabis dependence, but several controlled studies found no benefit for cocaine or methamphetamine dependence. Whether gabapentin is effective for other substance use disorders is unknown.
Asterixis has been reported as a side effect of toxic and metabolic abnormalities. The current literature contains very little evidence of gabapentin-related neurotoxicity. Our observations reveal that neurotoxic side effects of gabapentin use may be seen even when dose adjustments are made for patients with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction. Clinical vigilance for possible neurotoxic effects of gabapentin therapy in patients with renal dysfunction is warranted.
