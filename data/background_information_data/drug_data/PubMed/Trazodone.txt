Sedative antidepressants are commonly used drugs in the treatment of insomnia. However, some recommendations claim that only hypnotics have been proven effective in the treatment of sleep initiation and maintenance disorders. The aim of this article is to compare the effect of hypnotics and trazodone on sleep, and to analyse the evidence for the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. Three studies investigated the effects of trazodone on sleep in primary insomnia, 5 studies on insomnia in the course of affective disorders and 6 studies on insomnia in other indications (PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol and opiate dependence, somatoform disorder, and insomnia during pregnancy). In the treatment of insomnia, trazodone is less effective than hypnotics in the treatment of sleep onset insomnia (i.e., disorders of falling asleep). For this indication it needs to be administered earlier than hypnotics, at least 1 hour before bedtime. It is, however, very effective in the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, especially in patients with comorbid mental disorders or patients treated with activating antidepressants. Hypnotics and trazodone have the opposite effect on deep sleep. Trazodone increases the duration of deep sleep, which is associated with better sleep quality as assessed by patients. In contrast, hypnotics decrease slow-wave activityin sleep EEG, which is the biomarker of deep sleep. The main mechanism through which trazodone promotes sleep is its antagonistic effect on 5-HT2 serotonin receptors, while hypnotics are agonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAA receptors, and other sedative antidepressants block H1 histamine receptors. This is associated with a low risk of weight gain, which is rare with trazodone treatment.
A fatal case of suicide with trazodone alone in a 40-year-old patient is reported. Life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes and complete AV block, are recorded. Blood collected at admission contained a trazodone toxic concentration of 25.4 micrograms/mL. The patient developed multiple organ failure and died less than 24 hours after his admission to the emergency department. The authors discuss the effects of overdose of trazodone, a well-known safe antidepressant drug.
Based on the original literature, the author for the first time describes a history of selective serotonergic antidepressants simultaneously inhibiting the serotonin reuptake and directly interacting with serotonin receptors. A history of creation and introduction of their main representatives is presented. A history of investigation of their neurochemical activity is analyzed in details. The history of the evolution of their classifications is systemized. The data presented suggest the rationale for unifying all selective serotonergic antidepressants, simultaneously inhibiting the serotonin reuptake and directly interacting with serotonin receptors (trazodone, etoperidone, nefazodone, vilazodone, vortioxetine), in one group of 'multimodal serotonergic antidepressants'. The expediency to include this group in the modern neurochemical classification of nootropic drugs is substantiated.
Trazodone is an antidepressant that is FDA-approved for the treatment of depression. It has been used by mental health and primary care providers for the treatment of multiple psychiatric and medical conditions .This review describes trazodone mechanism of action, formulation, dosage and adverse effects and then summarizes the beneficial effects of trazodone in the treatment of various psychiatric and medical conditions such as major depression, as well non-approved FDA indications such as insomnia,anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, feeding and eating disorders, substance use disorders, behavioral disturbances associated with cognitive dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, certain pain conditions, and rehabilitation after acute ischemic stroke. Despite trazodone's favorable effects in the treatment of FDA-unapproved psychiatric and medical conditions, large, randomized controlled clinical trials are still needed to confirm its efficacy in the treatment of the multiple conditions for which it is often used in clinical practice.
We present a 41 years old male, treated with trazodone because of depression. He was seen at our Andrology unit for a 72 hours evolutioned priapism. We review the literature and submit this paper for publication because it is an uncommon pathology.
