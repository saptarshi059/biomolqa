Besides the natural progestin, progesterone, there are different classes of progestins, such as retroprogesterone (i.e. dydrogesterone), progesterone derivatives (i.e. medrogestone) 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (i.e. chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate), 19-norprogesterone derivatives (i.e. nomegestrol, promegestone, trimegestone, nesterone), 19-nortestosterone derivatives norethisterone (NET), lynestrenol, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest) and spironolactone derivatives (i.e. drospirenone). Some of the synthetic progestins are prodrugs, which need to be metabolized to become active compounds. Besides the progestogenic effect, which is in common for all progestins, there is a wide range of biological effects, which are different for the various progestins and have to be taken into account, when medical treatment is considered.
BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients are subject to acute illness and stress which may impact appetite or weight. Loss of appetite may lead to increased morbidity or mortality. Medications such as dronabinol, megestrol, and mirtazapine are used for weight gain in the outpatient setting; however, there is limited information about safety or effectiveness when initiated inpatient. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effectiveness and safety of appetite-stimulating medications in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients initiated on dronabinol, megestrol, or mirtazapine for appetite. The primary outcome was change in meal intake between drug initiation and discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included documented improvement in appetite, change in weight and various laboratory parameters, and incidence of adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients met inclusion criteria, and mirtazapine was most commonly used (42%). There was no significant difference between groups of appetite-stimulating medications with regard to mean change in meal intake, weight, albumin, or documented improvement in diet. Within groups, each agent showed numerical improvement in percentage meal intake, with a mean change from initiation to discontinuation of 17.12%. Almost half (48%) of the patients experienced improvement in diet after the start of medications. No serious adverse effects were observed. Conclusion and Relevance: In inpatients, there was no difference in change in meal intake or weight between dronabinol, megestrol, or mirtazapine, but they may show numerical improvements in meal intake. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the use of dronabinol, megestrol, and mirtazapine initiated in the inpatient setting.
No. Megestrol acetate (MA) is neither safe nor effective for stimulating appetite in malnourished nursing home residents. It increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (strength of recommendation [SOR]: C, 2 retrospective chart reviews), but isn't associated with other new or worsening events or disorders (SOR: B, single randomized controlled trial [RCT]). Over a 25-week period, MA wasn't associated with increased mortality (SOR: B, single RCT). After 44 months, however, MA-treated patients showed decreased median survival (SOR: B, single case-control study). Consistent, meaningful weight gain was not observed with MA treatment (SOR: B, single case-control study, single RCT, 2 retrospective chart reviews, single prospective case-series).
This case describes the first report of a patient developing Cushing's syndrome whilst being treated with the synthetic progestogen, megestrol acetate (Megace). Drugs are the commonest cause of Cushing's syndrome. Some synthetic progestogens are known to have glucocorticoid activity at high doses. On structural grounds neither megestrol nor its major metabolites would be expected to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor, through the manufacturers report that it may have 'weak glucocorticoid activity'.
Exemestane is a steroidal agent which causes inactivation of the aromatase enzyme by binding irreversibly to the substrate binding site. Oral exemestane 25 mg/day inactivates peripheral aromatase activity (approximately 98% inactivation) and reduces basal plasma estrone, estradiol and estrone sulphate levels by 85 to 95% in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Phase II trials indicate that oral exemestane 25 mg/day is an effective second- or third-line agent in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (achieving an objective response in up to 28 and 26% of patients, respectively). Results from a phase III trial indicate that exemestane achieves a similar objective response rate to megestrol as a second-line therapy; however, exemestane achieved a significantly longer duration of overall success, time to disease progression and survival time. Exemestane is at least as well tolerated as megestrol, but is associated with significantly fewer bodyweight changes, mainly bodyweight gain (> or = 10%). Other common adverse events are hot flushes, nausea and fatigue.
