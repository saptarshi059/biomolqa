The two drugs known to be useful in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis are ganciclovir and foscarnet--usually they are given intravenously. Intravitreal ganciclovir seems to be even more effective. A pump system to deliver the drug into the vitreous is being developed.
A 33-year-old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome received ganciclovir for presumed cytomegalovirus retinitis. Although results of baseline liver function tests were abnormal, marked elevations of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase occurred when the drug was first instituted, as well as after rechallenge. These elevated laboratory values declined on each occasion that the drug was withdrawn. As no other toxic or infectious insults could clearly be incriminated in these acute, self-limited episodes of hepatic function abnormalities, ganciclovir was most likely responsible for the toxicity observed in this patient.
Ganciclovir is synthetic nucleoside analog of guanine closely related to acyclovir but has greater activity against cytomegalovirus. This comprehensive profile on ganciclovir starts with a description of the drug: nomenclature, formulae, chemical structure, elemental composition, and appearance. The uses and application of the drug are explained. The methods that were used for the preparation of ganciclovir are described and their respective schemes are outlined. The methods which were used for the physical characterization of the dug are: ionization constant, solubility, X-ray powder diffraction pattern, crystal structure, melting point, and differential scanning calorimetry. The chapter contains the spectra of the drug: ultraviolet spectrum, vibrational spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and the mass spectrum. The compendial methods of analysis of ganciclovir include the United States Pharmacopeia methods. Other methods of analysis that were reported in the literature include: high-performance liquid chromatography alone or with mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, voltammetry, chemiluminescence, and radioimmunoassay. Biological investigation on the drug includes: pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bioavailability, and biological analysis. Reviews on the methods used for preparation or for analysis of the drug are provided. The stability of the drug in various media and storage conditions is reported. More than 240 references are listed at the end of the chapter.
BACKGROUND: Ganciclovir can be used to treat a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, however it can cause side effects. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 60-year-old immunocompromised woman with a primary CMV infection who was treated with ganciclovir. She developed an encephalopathy which resolved after discontinuation of ganciclovir. CONCLUSION: A reversible encephalopathy as a side effect of ganciclovir.
Although a rare cause of symptomatic infection in normal persons, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is of increasing importance in the immunocompromised host. Effective treatment is now available with ganciclovir; foscarnet offers a possible alternative, especially for patients infected with ganciclovir-resistant CMV strains. Primary CMV infection can be prevented by serologic screening of blood (and organ) donors. An alternative approach for prevention of transfusion-associated CMV infection is leukocyte depletion by filtration. Immunoglobulin immunoprophylaxis remains controversial but may be effective in ameliorating disease in renal allograft patients. Acyclovir is partially effective in suppressing infection in already seropositive patients, but ganciclovir and foscarnet offer more promise for this purpose.
