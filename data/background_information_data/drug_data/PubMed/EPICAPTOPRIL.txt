The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [3H]SQ29,852 identified a single high affinity recognition site (defined by 10.0 microM captopril) in the human temporal cortex (pKD 8.62 +/- 0.03; Bmax 248 +/- 24 fmol mg-1 protein, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4). ACE inhibitors and thiorphan competed to a similar level for the [3H]SQ29,852 binding site in the human temporal cortex with a rank order of affinity (pKi values mean +/- S.E.M., n = 3), lisinopril (9.49 +/- 0.02), captopril (9.16 +/- 0.08), SQ29,852 (8.58 +/- 0.04), epicaptopril (7.09 +/- 0.08), fosinopril (7.08 +/- 0.05) and thiorphan (6.40 +/- 0.04). Since this rank order of affinity is similar to the affinity of these compounds to inhibit brain ACE activity it is concluded that [3H]SQ29,852 selectively labels the inhibitor recognition site of ACE in the human temporal cortex.
Free radical (FR) scavenging may be a therapeutically useful adjunctive property of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In this study we have shown that SH-containing ACE inhibitors (captopril, epicaptopril, zofenopril) are potent FR scavengers at a concentration of 4 x 10(-5) M whereas non-SH ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, quinaprilat and perindoprilat) have no FR-scavenging activity at this concentration. Furthermore, the SH-containing agents preferentially scavenged general radicals rather than superoxide radicals, i.e. suggesting that these drugs would be effective in quenching the culprit FR in ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
Hypomagnesemia continues to be a significant clinical disorder that is present in patients with diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and treatment with magnesuric drugs (diuretics, cancer chemotherapy agents, etc.). To determine the role of magnesium in cardiovascular pathophysiology, we have used dietary restriction of this cation in animal models. This review highlights some key observations that helped formulate the hypothesis that release of substance P (SP) during experimental dietary Mg deficiency (MgD) may initiate a cascade of deleterious inflammatory, oxidative, and nitrosative events, which ultimately promote cardiomyopathy, in situ cardiac dysfunction, and myocardial intolerance to secondary stresses. SP acts primarily through neurokinin-1 receptors of inflammatory and endothelial cells, and may induce production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (superoxide anion, NO*, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl radical), leading to enhanced consumption of tissue antioxidants; stimulate release of inflammatory mediators; promote tissue adhesion molecule expression; and enhance inflammatory cell tissue infiltration and cardiovascular lesion formation. These SP-mediated events may predispose the heart to injury if faced with subsequent oxidative stressors (ischemia/reperfusion, certain drugs) or facilitate development of in situ cardiac dysfunction, especially with prolonged dietary Mg restriction. Significant protection against most of these MgD-mediated events has been observed with interventions that modulate neuronal SP release or its bioactivity, and with several antioxidants (vitamin E, probucol, epicaptopril, d-propranolol). In view of the clinical prevalence of hypomagnesemia, new treatments, beyond magnesium repletion, may be needed to diminish deleterious neurogenic and prooxidative components described in this article.
The present studies assessed the nature of the recognition site for [3H]ceranapril in tissue from rat and human brain. [3H]Ceranapril exhibited high affinity saturable specific (defined by 1 microM captopril) binding to homogenates of tissue from both rat and human brain (mean pKd values between 8.42 and 8.69). High binding densities were observed in rat striatum and homogenates of tissue from human caudate (Bmax values 3317 +/- 192 and 1900 +/- 110 fmol/mg protein respectively), with comparatively low densities in cortical tissues. In kinetic experiments, association of [3H]ceranapril to homogenates of rat and human cortex was found to be rapid and fully reversible (K+1 = 6 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1 and 2.4 x 10(6) M-1 sec-1, K-1 = 7.6 x 10(-3) sec-1 and 4.5 x 10(-3) sec-1 respectively). In competition studies, lisinopril, captopril, unlabelled ceranapril, epicaptopril and fosinopril, all competed to a similar extent and with similar rank order of potency for the binding of [3H]ceranapril to homogenates of both rat and human brain. In in vivo studies, pretreatment of rats with either captopril or lisinopril (15 micrograms/250 g) significantly reduced the content of tritium in brain, as measured 20 min after intravenous administration of [3H]ceranapril. From these experiments [3H]ceranpril appears to selectively label, with high affinity, the inhibitor binding site of angiotensin converting enzyme and this site appears to be similar in both species studied.
