The loss of early-phase insulin secretion is an important and early event in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. Because a normal pattern of insulin secretion is essential for the effective control of postprandial metabolism, a rational basis for the development of agents that target early-phase insulin release exists. Conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents do not target, or adequately control, postprandial glycaemia. The emergence of new classes of oral agent with a more specific mode of action provides, for the first time, an opportunity to restore early-phase insulin release. One such drug class is the meglitinide analogues (repaglinide, nateglinide, and mitiglinide). These drugs are ideally suited for combination use with metformin. They could also prove effective in combination with a thiazolidinedione, a drug class that targets insulin resistance. Exogenous insulin is frequently required in the late management of type 2 diabetes. However, one hope for newer combinations of diabetic drugs is that the functional life of the beta cell can be extended, thereby delaying the need for insulin injections.
During the last 10-15 years, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 has emerged as an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. CYP2C8 is highly expressed in human liver and is known to metabolize more than 100 drugs. CYP2C8 substrate drugs include amodiaquine, cerivastatin, dasabuvir, enzalutamide, imatinib, loperamide, montelukast, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone, and the number is increasing. Similarly, many drugs have been identified as CYP2C8 inhibitors or inducers. In vivo, already a small dose of gemfibrozil, i.e., 10% of its therapeutic dose, is a strong, irreversible inhibitor of CYP2C8. Interestingly, recent findings indicate that the acyl-beta-glucuronides of gemfibrozil and clopidogrel cause metabolism-dependent inactivation of CYP2C8, leading to a strong potential for drug interactions. Also several other glucuronide metabolites interact with CYP2C8 as substrates or inhibitors, suggesting that an interplay between CYP2C8 and glucuronides is common. Lack of fully selective and safe probe substrates, inhibitors, and inducers challenges execution and interpretation of drug-drug interaction studies in humans. Apart from drug-drug interactions, some CYP2C8 genetic variants are associated with altered CYP2C8 activity and exhibit significant interethnic frequency differences. Herein, we review the current knowledge on substrates, inhibitors, inducers, and pharmacogenetics of CYP2C8, as well as its role in clinically relevant drug interactions. In addition, implications for selection of CYP2C8 marker and perpetrator drugs to investigate CYP2C8-mediated drug metabolism and interactions in preclinical and clinical studies are discussed.
This review presents the dynamic and fast growing concept of precision medicine in a simple and succinct manner. It describes the potential of precision medicine in diabetes praxis, under three headings: diagnosis of type of diabetes, choice of pharmacotherapy for glucose lowering, and management of complications of diabetes. This review should make the scope of precision medicine easy to understand for the practicing physician.
Glinides, including repaglinide, nateglinide and mitiglinide, are a type of fasting insulin secretagogue that could help to mimic early-phase insulin release, thus providing improved control of the postprandial glucose levels. Glinides stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the pancreatic beta-cell membrane. Although glinides have been widely used clinically and display excellent safety and efficacy, the response to glinides varies among individuals, which is partially due to genetic factors involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and targeting. Several pharmacogenomic studies have demonstrated that variants of genes involved in the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of glinides are associated with the drug response. Polymorphisms of genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C8 and SLCO1B1, may influence the efficacy of glinides and the incidence of adverse effects. In addition, Type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility genes, such as KCNQ1, PAX4 and BETA2, also influence the efficacy of glinides. In this article, we review and discuss current pharmacogenomics researches on glinides, and hopefully provide useful data and proof for clinical application.
We report the first case of repaglinide-induced factitious hypoglycemia in a young male. This case posed a challenging diagnostic dilemma because commercial assays for repaglinide are not available. Furthermore, the patient had a series of positive diagnostic tests such as high proinsulin and localizing intra-arterial calcium stimulation suggestive of insulinoma. This case, again, demonstrates the importance of pure clinical judgment in the face of often-conflicting laboratory data in making a correct diagnosis and the requirement of definitive data for an appropriate therapeutic resolution.
