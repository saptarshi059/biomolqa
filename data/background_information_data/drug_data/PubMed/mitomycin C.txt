Bleb failure after implantation of filtering stents (e.g. Preserflo Stent) is a frequent challenge in glaucoma surgery that has occurred in recent years. In the following, a technique for open bleb revision with mitomycin C (0.2â€¯mg/ml) and ologen implantation is presented, which is intended to re-establish the filtration volume lost due to fibrosis and a long-term preservation.
Trabeculectomy is the commonest surgical intervention performed worldwide for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. However, the use of antimetabolites during trabeculectomy has been associated with various bleb related complications. We report this interesting case to highlight unique clinical presentation and management of a leftover mitomycin-C sponge causing blebitis.
The use of mitomycin-C as a mixed formulation with lidocaine and epinephrine for filtration surgery may alter its pH and consequently affect clinical effectivity.
Mitomycin C (MMC) is an antineoplastic antibiotic that has been used off-label in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Herein we report our successful use of this agent in a patient with sternal keloids refractory to other means of therapy. We further review the literature regarding the use of MMC in the treatment of keloids.
Isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus, mitomycin C (MMC) has various applications in the management of corneal and external disease due to its ability to modulate cellular proliferation. It has been employed in pterygium surgery, ocular surface neoplasia, and refractive surgery. Currently, there is no definite consensus on the treatment protocols for each of the aforementioned applications. Although its benefits in the management of corneal and external diseases are promising, MMC use has potential complications including endothelial cell loss, corneal perforation, scleral melt, secondary glaucoma, iritis, and endophthalmitis. This article will review the literature regarding the use of MMC in the field of cornea and external disease and describe protocols employed with corresponding outcomes.
