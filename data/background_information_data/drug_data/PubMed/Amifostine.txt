Ifosfamide is relatively well tolerated but it can be associated occasionally with life-threatening complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure, severe encephalopathy and hemorrhagic cystitis. Mesna administration can control the urothelial toxicity of ifosfamide, but it is without effect on the other complications. Other preventive measures, such as amifostine or methylene blue administration, have not yet been adequately evaluated in a sufficient number of patients. Clinicians prescribing ifosfamide, especially in high doses, should be watchful for early signs of toxicity in order to discontinue ifosfamide administration soon enough to avoid development of major toxicity.
Despite ototoxicity being a prevalent consequence of cisplatin chemotherapy, little guidance exists on interventions to prevent this permanent and progressive adverse event. To develop a clinical practice guideline for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in children and adolescents with cancer, we convened an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts and patient advocates to update a systematic review of randomised trials for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. The systematic review identified 27 eligible adult and paediatric trials that evaluated amifostine, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate or disulfiram, systemic sodium thiosulfate, intratympanic therapies, and cisplatin infusion duration. Regarding systemic sodium thiosulfate, the panel made a strong recommendation for administration in non-metastatic hepatoblastoma, a weak recommendation for administration in other non-metastatic cancers, and a weak recommendation against its routine use in metastatic cancers. Amifostine, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, and intratympanic therapy should not be routinely used. Cisplatin infusion duration should not be altered as a means to reduce ototoxicity. Further research to determine the safety of sodium thiosulfate in patients with metastatic cancer is encouraged.
Protecting the whole small intestine from radiation-induced intestinal injury during the radiotherapy of abdominal or pelvic solid tumors remains an unmet clinical need. Amifostine is a promising selective radioprotector for normal tissues. However, its oral application in intestinal radioprotection remains challenging. Herein, we use microalga Spirulina platensis as a microcarrier of Amifostine to construct an oral delivery system. The system shows comprehensive drug accumulation and effective radioprotection in the whole small intestine that is significantly superior to free drug and its enteric capsule, preventing the radiation-induced intestine injury and prolonging the survival without influencing the tumor regression. It also shows benefits on the gut microbiota homeostasis and long-term safety. Based on a readily available natural microcarrier, this work presents a convenient oral delivery system to achieve effective radioprotection for the whole small intestine, providing a competitive strategy with great clinical translation potential.
Current therapeutic approaches for lung cancer favor treatment intensification, with the presumption that dose-intense chemotherapy regimens and/or higher radiation therapy (RT) doses or novel fractionation schemes will result in increased patient survival. Also, the trend for non-operative therapy has favored concurrent over sequential regimens. The incidence of severe acute esophagitis in patients treated for lung cancer with standard (once daily) RT alone is 1.3%, and induction chemotherapy increases the risk of severe acute esophagitis slightly over that of standard RT alone. In contrast, a strong radiosensitizing effect of chemotherapy given concurrently with standard thoracic RT (chemoRT) is associated with an incidence of severe esophagitis of 14% to 49%. Acute esophagitis may be severe and disabling, and result in hospitalization, placement of a feeding tube in the stomach or intravenous feedings, and steady supportive care. Also, RT may need to be halted temporarily to allow for healing of the esophageal lining; treatment breaks in turn decrease survival of patients with unresectable lung cancer. Therefore, esophagitis as a dose-limiting toxicity of chemoRT may have a direct impact on tumor control and survival. Aggressive types of RT fractionation have also been associated with worsening esophagitis grades and duration. Moreover, it is commonly assumed in the radiation oncology clinic that the longer the length of the esophagus segment included in the RT field the higher the probability of esophageal toxicity, although differing opinions are commonly expressed. Recent advances in 3-dimensional conformal RT allow a unique chance to gain volumetric data pertaining to organ damage rather than rely on older estimates based on organ length (eg, esophagus) or portion (ie, lung, spinal cord). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) conducted a large phase III, randomized study RTOG 98-01 examining chemoRT with or without the amifostine (Ethyol; MedImmune, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD), a cyto- and radioprotectant in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (n = 243). While amifostine did not significantly reduce severe esophagitis based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria and weekly physician dysphagia logs, swallowing dysfunction over time (based on patient diaries, the equivalent of Esophagitis Index) was significantly lower in the amifostine arm ( P = .03). Therefore, significant progress has been accomplished in our understanding of the basis of esophageal injury resulting from thoracic RT, and future effort may find other effective strategies to either minimize or eliminate esophagitis.
INTRODUCTION: Mucositis is a significant complication of cancer therapy, with important clinical and economic implications. In June 2005, the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) conducted an evidence-based update review of the literature on mucositis. The goal of this literature review is to update previously published guidelines for the management of mucositis. RESULTS: This article reports the findings of the subgroup charged with reviewing the literature related to amifostine.
