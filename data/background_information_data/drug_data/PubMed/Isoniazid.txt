In clinical toxicology, gastric endoscopic decontamination is rarely used, and only a few cases of pharmacobezoar removal after intentional ingestion of slow-release drugs have been described. Our case describes the use of gastric endoscopic decontamination to remove potential pharmacobezoar in an adolescent after ingestion of a lethal dose of isoniazid and rifampin, even long after gastric lavage. This technique allowed the removal of pharmacobezoars still present in the stomach while preventing further deterioration of the patient.
Isoniazid though a very effective treatment for tuberculosis can cause severe motor-dominant neuropathy which can be reversible with pyridoxine supplementation. A 45-year-old female diagnosed with psoas abscess, culture positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis, was started on anti- tuberculous treatment with four drugs, including isoniazid at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Three months later she developed severe motor weakness of lower limbs with loss of ankle and knee reflexes. She was treated with vitamin B6 injections and isoniazid treatment was continued. Her motor weakness gradually improved in a few months, but mild sensory impairment persisted even after two years. There is need for vigilance regarding neurological effects of isoniazid in seemingly low-risk individuals in whom development of symptoms should raise the suspicion about slow acetylator status. Timely therapeutic intervention with high-dose vitamin B6 can reduce the long-term morbidity associated with this easily reversible condition.
We present two cases of acute isoniazid poisoning in patients who ingested 7.5 g and 5.0 g of isoniazid respectively, with the intention of committing suicide. Both were admitted unconscious, with ventilatory insufficiency and convulsions. Hepatic dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy were notable complications.
Pellagra is a clinical syndrome caused by a deficiency of niacin (nicotinic acid) and/or its precursor tryptophan. The cardinal manifestations are 4 D's: dermatitis, diarrhoea, dementia and in worst case death. Increased use of isoniazid prophylaxis along with antiretroviral therapy in countries where latent tuberculosis is common has been associated with increased presentations with pellagra.
Anaphylaxis from isoniazid is a possible side effect to this commonly prescribed antibiotic. The case reported here illustrates that clinicians should be aware of this potentially fatal drug reaction.
