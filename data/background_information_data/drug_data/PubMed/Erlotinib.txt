PURPOSE: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis and there have been no improvements in survival since the introduction of gemcitabine in 1996. Pancreatic tumors often overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1/EGFR) and this is associated with a worse prognosis. We studied the effects of adding the HER1/EGFR-targeted agent erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive standard gemcitabine plus erlotinib (100 or 150 mg/d orally) or gemcitabine plus placebo in a double-blind, international phase III trial. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 569 patients were randomly assigned. Overall survival based on an intent-to-treat analysis was significantly prolonged on the erlotinib/gemcitabine arm with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .038, adjusted for stratification factors; median 6.24 months v 5.91 months). One-year survival was also greater with erlotinib plus gemcitabine (23% v 17%; P = .023). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with erlotinib plus gemcitabine with an estimated HR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92; P = .004). Objective response rates were not significantly different between the arms, although more patients on erlotinib had disease stabilization. There was a higher incidence of some adverse events with erlotinib plus gemcitabine, but most were grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this randomized phase III trial is the first to demonstrate statistically significantly improved survival in advanced pancreatic cancer by adding any agent to gemcitabine. The recommended dose of erlotinib with gemcitabine for this indication is 100 mg/d.
BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. The poor prognosis primarily stems from late-stage diagnosis and when the disease has become therapeutically challenging. There is an urgent need to identify specific biomarkers for cancer subtyping and early detection to enhance both morbidity and mortality outcomes. The addition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib, to gemcitabine chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer slightly improved outcomes. However, restricted clinical benefits may be linked to the absence of well-characterized criteria for stratification and dependable biomarkers for the prediction of treatment effectiveness. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the levels of various cancer hallmarks and identified glycolysis as the primary risk factor for overall survival in PC. Subsequently, we developed a glycolysis-related score (GRS) model to accurately distinguish PC patients with high GRS. Through in silico screening of 4398 compounds, we discovered that erlotinib had the strongest therapeutic benefits for high-GRS PC patients. Furthermore, we identified ARNTL2 as a novel prognostic biomarker and a predictive factor for erlotinib treatment responsiveness in patients with PC. Inhibition of ARNTL2 expression reduced the therapeutic efficacy, whereas increased expression of ARNTL2 improved PC cell sensitivity to erlotinib. Validation in vivo using patient-derived xenografts (PDX-PC) with varying ARNTL2 expression levels demonstrated that erlotinib monotherapy effectively halted tumor progression in PDX-PC models with high ARNTL2 expression. In contrast, PDX-PC models lacking ARNTL2 did not respond favorably to erlotinib treatment. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the ARNTL2/E2F1 axis-mediated cellular glycolysis sensitizes PC cells to erlotinib treatment by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations have identified ARNTL2 as a novel prognostic biomarker and predictive indicator of sensitivity. These results will help to identify erlotinib-responsive cases of PC and improve treatment outcomes. These findings contribute to the advancement of precision oncology, enabling more accurate and targeted therapeutic interventions.
Erlotinib (OSI-774), marketed by Genentech as Tarceva(R), is anticancer drug approved by US-FDA for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Pancreatic Cancer. Erlotinib inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that blocks tumor cell division, produces cell cycle arrest, and initiates programmed cell death in EGFR-overexpressing human tumor cells. This study presents a comprehensive profile of erlotinib, including detailed nomenclature, formula, elemental analysis, methods of preparation, physico-chemical characteristics, and methods of analysis (including spectroscopic, electrochemical, and chromatographic methods of analysis). Spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses include UV/vis spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry ((1)H and (13)C NMR), and mass spectrometry. Chromatographic methods of analyses include thin layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacology of erlotinib including pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions were also presented. An appropriate table and figures were attached to each of the above mentioned sections along with total of 48 references.
Olmsted syndrome (OS) is a rare genetic disorder, characterized by painful palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), periorificial and intertriginous hyperkeratoses, and alopecia. Fewer than 75 cases have been described. Variants in TRPV3 result in constitutive activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 3, leading to increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, palmoplantar epidermal hyperproliferation, and exquisite lesional pain. We describe pre-school aged twins with OS with partial improvement from oral erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, but dramatic reduction of their persistent palmoplantar thickening and pain from adding acitretin.
Erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used for treating patients with cancer exhibiting EGFR overexpression or mutation. However, the response rate of erlotinib is low among patients with gastric cancer (GC). The findings of this study illustrated that the overexpression of bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF) is partially responsible for erlotinib resistance in GC, and the combination of the BPTF inhibitor AU-1 with erlotinib synergistically inhibited tumor growth both in vivo and in vitro. AU-1 inhibited the epigenetic function of BPTF and decreased the transcriptional activity of c-MYC on PLCG1 by attenuating chromosome accessibility of the PLCG1 promoter region, thus decreasing the expression of p-PLCG1 and p-Erk and eventually improving the sensitivity of GC cells to erlotinib. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, AU-1 monotherapy exhibited remarkable tumor-inhibiting activity and is synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with erlotinib. Altogether, the findings illustrate that BPTF affects the responsiveness of GC to erlotinib by epigenetically regulating the c-MYC/PLCG1/pErk axis, and the combination of BPTF inhibitors and erlotinib is a viable therapeutic approach for GC.
