Placement of carmustine-impregnated wafers has become a common practice after surgical resection of malignant gliomas. Bevacizumab is used as a second-line agent for the treatment of malignant gliomas and is sometimes used in patients who have had recent wafer implantation. We describe two cases of fatal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in patients treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan after 4 weeks of carmustine wafer implantation. Possible mechanisms for the CSF leak in these patients are discussed. We recommend waiting for a longer period of time before starting bevacizumab in patients who had implantation of carmustine wafers.
A prospective randomized trial in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma was performed comparing carmustine (BCNU), cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (BCP) to melphalan (Alkeran) and prednisone (AP). Induction response rates, remission duration, and survival were similar with both regimens. Hematologic toxicity was greater with AP. Crossover studies in patients who relapsed did not illustrate any significant activity with either drug treatment program. Therefore, BCP can be utilized as initial therapy in myeloma because of comparable remission rates and less hematologic toxicity.
10 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with elevated doses of carmustine and mitomycin C. The regimen was potentiated by lonidamine and supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation. The results of this pilot study were encouraging, with a response rate of 50% and a significantly better survival for responders versus non-responders. No appreciable toxicity of the therapy was observed. This aspect, together with the simplicity of the procedure, calls for further investigations to confirm the good therapeutic index of the treatment.
BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer, poses significant challenges due to its resistance to therapy and high recurrence rates. This study aimed to investigate the expression and functional implications of CDKN2A, a key tumor suppressor gene, in glioblastoma cells, building upon the existing background of knowledge in this field. METHOD: Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to evaluate CDKN2A expression in U87 glioblastoma cells compared to normal human astrocytes (NHA). CDKN2A expression levels were manipulated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and CDKN2A overexpression vector. Cell viability assays and carmustine sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the impact of CDKN2A modulation on glioblastoma cell viability and drug response. Sphere formation assays and western blot analysis were performed to investigate the role of CDKN2A in glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and pluripotency marker expression. Additionally, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assays and demethylation treatment were employed to elucidate the mechanism of CDKN2A downregulation in U87 cells. RESULT: CDKN2A expression was significantly reduced in glioblastoma cells compared to NHA. CDKN2A overexpression resulted in decreased cell viability and enhanced sensitivity to carmustine treatment. CDKN2A inhibition promoted self-renewal capacity and increased pluripotency marker expression in U87 cells. CDKN2A upregulation led to elevated protein levels of p16INK4a, p14ARF, P53, and P21, which are involved in cell cycle regulation. CDKN2A downregulation in U87 cells was associated with high promoter methylation, which was reversed by treatment with a demethylating agent. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that CDKN2A downregulation in glioblastoma cells is associated with decreased cell viability, enhanced drug resistance, increased self-renewal capacity, and altered expression of pluripotency markers. The observed CDKN2A expression changes are mediated by promoter methylation. These results highlight the potential role of CDKN2A as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in glioblastoma.
BACKGROUND: To improve the outcome in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with maximal resection, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of implantation of carmustine wafers (CWs), radiation concomitant with temozolomide and bevacizumab, and maintenance chemotherapy with six cycles of temozolomide and bevacizumab. METHOD: This prospective phase II study enrolled glioblastoma patients considered candidates for complete resection (> 90%) of a contrast-enhanced lesion. The CWs were intraoperatively implanted into the resection cavity after achieving maximal resection. Patients without a measurable contrast-enhanced lesion on magnetic resonance imaging within 48 h after resection received concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide and bevacizumab, followed by maintenance treatment with up to six cycles of temozolomide and bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was the 2-year overall survival rate in glioblastoma patients with protocol treatment. RESULTS: From October 2015 to April 2018, we obtained consent for the first registration from 70 patients across 17 institutions in Japan, and 49 patients were treated according to the protocol. We evaluated the safety in 49 patients who were part of the second registration and the efficacy in 45 glioblastoma patients treated according to the protocol. The profile of hematological and most of the non-hematological adverse effects was similar to that in previous studies, but stroke occurred in 12% of cases (6/49 patients). The estimated 2-year overall survival rate was 51.3%. CONCLUSION: Implantation of CWs, followed by concomitant radiation, temozolomide, and bevacizumab, and six cycles of temozolomide and bevacizumab may offer some benefit to survival in Japanese glioblastoma patients with maximal resection. TRIAL ID: jRCTs021180007.
Eleven patients treated with intracarotid BCNU, cisplatinum, or BCNU and cisplatinum in combination for recurrent malignant gliomas were followed with serial ophthalmologic examinations for 2 to 11 months. Eight patients developed significant visual loss ipsilateral to the side of infusion. Secondary glaucoma and internal ophthalmoplegia were new complications observed after BCNU treatment. An unusual pigmentary retinopathy, previously unreported, was seen in patients treated with cisplatinum. One patient also developed a cavernous sinus syndrome after the intracarotid administration of cisplatinum.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine and compare the physicochemical stability of two carmustine-containing medicinal products licensed and marketed in Europe as Carmustin Obvius (Medac GmbH) and Carmubris (Tillomed Pharma GmbH). Reconstituted stock solutions and diluted ready-to-administer infusion solutions of the two products were investigated. METHODS: Reconstituted carmustine stock solutions (3.3 mg/mL) and ready-to-administer infusion solutions (0.2 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL) prepared in prefilled 5% glucose injection solution PP/PE bags were stored at 22 degrees C or 2-8 degrees C over a maximum period of 66 hours protected from light. Samples were taken immediately after reconstitution or dilution and after 3.5, 6, 8.5 and 11 hours when stored at 22 degrees C or after (12), 24, 48 and 60 hours when stored at 2-8 degrees C, followed by 3- and 6-hour storage at 22 degrees C (60+3 hours, 60+6 hours). Physicochemical stability was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, measurement of pH, osmolarity and inspection for visible particles or colour changes. RESULTS: Carmustin Obvius and Carmubris reconstituted stock solutions were physicochemically stable for at least 48 hours when stored at 2-8 degrees C. Carmustin Obvius and Carmubris infusion solutions 0.2 mg/mL were physicochemically stable for at least 8.5 hours and 60 hours when stored at 22 degrees C and 2-8 degrees C, respectively. After subsequent storage of the 60-hour refrigerated test solutions for 3 hours at 22 degrees C, the carmustine concentrations averaged the 90% limit and fell below the 90% limit after 6 hours. Carmustin Obvius infusion solutions 1.0 mg/mL were physicochemically stable for at least 8.5 hours when stored at 22 degrees C and for 60 hours when stored at 2-8 degrees C. CONCLUSION: According to the physicochemical stability data, the shelf life (95% limit) of the refrigerated stock solutions is 48 hours and the shelf life (90% limit) of ready-to-administer infusion solutions (0.2 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL) is 60 hours at 2-8 degrees C or 8.5 hours at 22 degrees C under light protection. These results facilitate the use of both medicinal products in a pharmacy-based centralised cytotoxic preparation unit.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor with limited therapeutic options. Besides surgery, chemotherapy using temozolomide, carmustine or lomustine is the main pillar of therapy. However, therapy success is limited and prognosis still is very poor. One restraining factor is drug resistance caused by drug transporters of the ATP-binding cassette family, e.g. ABCB1 and ABCG2, located at the blood-brain barrier and on tumor cells. The active efflux of xenobiotics including drugs, e.g. temozolomide, leads to low intracellular drug concentrations and subsequently insufficient anti-tumor effects. Nevertheless, the role of efflux transporters in GBM is controversially discussed. In the present study, we analyzed the role of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in GBM cells showing that ABCB1, but marginally ABCG2, is relevant. Applying a CRISPR/Cas9-derived ABCB1 knockout, the response to temozolomide was significantly augmented demonstrated by decreased cell number (p &lt; 0.001) and proliferation rate (p = 0.04), while apoptosis was increased (p = 0.04). For carmustine, a decrease of cells in G1-phase was detected pointing to cell cycle arrest in the ABCB1 knockout (p = 0.006). For lomustine, however, loss of ABCB1 did not alter the response to the treatment. Overall, this study shows that ABCB1 is involved in the active transport of temozolomide out of the tumor cells diminishing the response to temozolomide. Interestingly, loss of ABCB1 also affected the response to the lipophilic drug carmustine. These findings show that ABCB1 is not only relevant at the blood-brain barrier, but also in the tumor cells diminishing success of chemotherapy.
Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) as the most frequent and lethal brain tumor is defined by aggressive invasiveness and considerable resistance to chemotherapy. The molecular mechanisms underlying GBM tumorigenesis still needs to be further investigated. Considering that, the current study was aimed to investigate the function of miR-181a in human glioblastoma cells in combination with carmustine. U373 cell line with the low expression levels of miR-181a was selected for functional investigations. MTT assay was used to determine cell viability and Annexin V/PI and DAPI staining were employed to evaluate apoptosis induction. Also, cell migration and cell cycle progression were investigated using wound healing test and flow cytometry, respectively. qRT-PCR was used for the quantification of gene expression. MTT assay results revealed that miR-181a replacement increased the sensitivity of U373 cells to low doses of carmustine. Moreover, miR-181a was shown to increase the sub G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction by carmustine via regulating the expression of related genes including caspase-9, Bcl-2, and SIRT1. Furthermore, this miRNA combined with carmustine suppressed cell migration via downregulation of MMP-2 and Bach1 and reduced the clonogenic ability of U373 cells. Additionally, miR-181a-mediated downregulation of AKT1 implied that this miRNA could inhibit cell proliferation by modulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that miR-181a replacement, regarding its tumor-suppressive effects and sensitization of glioblastoma cells to carmustine, could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the efficiency of glioblastoma chemotherapy.
PURPOSE: An increased incidence in hematologic toxicity has been reported with the addition of bevacizumab to lomustine for patients with recurrent or progressive high grade gliomas (HGG). Data regarding incidence of toxicity with combination bevacizumab and carmustine is limited. The purpose of this study is to compare toxicity of single agent carmustine and carmustine plus bevacizumab for patients with HGGs. METHODS: This single center retrospective study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center included pathologically confirmed HGG with age >/= 18 years who received carmustine between January 2003 and May 2017. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with HGGs collectively received 110 doses of BCNU during the specified time period. Sixteen patients received single agent BCNU (30 doses); 49 patients received combination bevacizumab with BCNU (80 doses). There was no significant difference in incidence or grade of toxicity between single agent and combination therapy with respect to hepatotoxicity, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Rates of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (20% vs 13.8%, p = 0.55) and thrombocytopenia (23.3% vs 23.8%, p = 1) did not differ between single agent BCNU versus combination therapy. When stratified based on dose ( < 150 mg/m(2), 150 mg/m(2), > 150 mg/m(2)), there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to grade 3 and 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the toxicity of carmustine with or without bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent and refractory HGG. The addition of bevacizumab to carmustine did not increase incidence or grade of hematologic toxicity when compared to single agent carmustine.
Metastatic melanoma has a grim prognosis. Response rates and survival of patients treated with combination chemotherapy are not superior to single-agent chemotherapy. This study seeks to evaluate the objective response rate and survival of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with multiagent chemotherapy, with or without tamoxifen. Forty-two patients with metastatic melanoma were treated from March 1982 to February 1988 with dacarbazine, cisplatin and carmustine, with or without tamoxifen. An overall objective response rate of 43% was seen (complete response rate 17%; partial response rate, 26%). The response rate was 54% for patients treated with tamoxifen and 25% for patients treated without tamoxifen, but the results did not achieve statistical significance. Median overall survival was 412 days, and was significantly longer in the tamoxifen-treated group. Combination chemotherapy as described in this study is well-tolerated. The observation that tamoxifen appears to impact on survival should be interpreted with great caution due to the deficiencies in the design of the trial and small patient numbers. A randomized trial of this regimen vs single-agent chemotherapy is indicated and is currently being conducted.
OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively determine the safety and efficacy of combined chemotherapy with carmustine (BCNU) wafer, bevacizumab, and temozolomide plus radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive newly diagnosed GBMs were resected at our institution between 2010 and 2016. Twenty-nine patients underwent BCNU wafer implantation into the resection cavity followed by standard radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ, Stupp regimen) plus additional bevacizumab treatment between 2013 and 2016. Twenty-five patients who underwent resection without BCNU implantation between 2010 and 2012 were enrolled as a control group; these patients were treated with the Stupp regimen and did not receive bevacizumab. This retrospective study included evaluation of progression-free survival and overall survival, plus comparisons between the combined therapy group and the control group. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Status on admission, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutation ratio, or resection rate between the combined and standard therapy groups. The median overall survival in the combined therapy group and control group was 24.2 months and 15.30, respectively (P = 0.027). The median progression-free survival was 16.8 months and 7.30 months, respectively (P = 0.009). Overall, the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug was similar between the treatment groups, except for infection, which was more common in the combined treatment group and required repeat surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The combined therapy showed higher efficacy compared with standard therapy in patients with GBM. Therefore, combined therapy seems to be effective with an acceptable toxicity profile.
BACKGROUND AIMS: The combination therapy of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy has been employed to improve outcomes for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin-lymphoma (B-NHL). The widely used conditioning regimen before ASCT plus CART therapy reported in the literature was carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM). However, whether adding fludarabine to the BEAM regimen (BEAMF) can improve the survival of patients with R/R B-NHL remains unknown. METHODS: In total, 39 and 19 patients with R/R B-NHL were enrolled to compare clinical outcomes in the BEAM and BEAMF regimens before ASCT plus CD19/22 CART therapy, respectively. RESULTS: The objective response (OR) rates at 3 months to BEAM and BEAMF regimens before ASCT plus CD19/22 CART therapy were 71.8% and 94.7%, respectively (P = 0.093). The BEAMF regimen showed a trend towards a superior duration of response compared with the BEAM regimen (P = 0.09). After a median follow-up of 28 months (range: 0.93-51.9 months), the BEAMF regimen demonstrated superior 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) (89.5% versus 63.9%; P = 0.048) and 2-year overall survival (OS) (100% vs 77.3%; P = 0.035) compared with the BEAM regimen. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, OR at month 3 (responders) was remarkably correlated with better OS (hazard ratio: 0.112, P = 0.005) compared with OR (non-responders). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with R/R B-NHL, the BEAMF regimen before ASCT plus CD19/22 CART therapy was correlated with superior PFS and OS than the BEAM regimen, and the BEAMF regimen is a promising alternative conditioning regimen for ASCT plus CAR-T therapy.
This study aimed to compare the real-life results of TECAM, a thiotepa-based conditioning regimen consisting of thiotepa (40 mg/m(2) days -5 to -2), etoposide (200 mg/m(2) days -6 to -3), cytarabine (200 mg/m(2) days -4 to -1), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg day -3), and melphalan (60 mg/m(2) days -2 to -1) with that of the conventional carmustine-based regimen BEAM. We reviewed 125 consecutive patients who underwent a first autologous transplantation (ASCT) for B-cell lymphomas at a large tertiary transplantation center between 1999 and 2014. TECAM (n=65) and BEAM (n=60) had comparable results (3yPFS 49 vs 62%, P=0.16; 3yOS 64 vs 71%, P=0.44; TRM 1.6 vs 5%, P=0.35) without a difference in toxicity or time to engraftment. Notably, comparable outcomes were observed even though patients treated with TECAM were older (55 vs 44) and had a trend towards more prior lines of therapy (>2 prior lines: 43 vs 27%, P=0.08). In this regard, 23% of TECAM patients were over the age of 65 yet could withstand therapy with similar results to younger patients. We conclude that, replacing carmustine by thiotepa and cyclophosphamide for ASCT conditioning, has comparable efficacy and safety profiles with a possible advantage in older patients.
BACKGROUND: High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) is a standard treatment for relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients. Yet, the widespread use of BEAM is hindered by carmustine accessibility. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of PEAM (Cisplatin, Etoposide, Cytarabine, and Melphalan) versus BEAM in auto-HSCT for Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study of adult lymphoma patients who received PEAM or BEAM pretransplant conditioning between January 2004 to December 2022, comparing efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS: Among 143 patients (median age of 33 years, 58% males), 55 had HL, and 88 had NHL. The overall response rate (ORR) was 86.7% for PEAM and 72.3% for BEAM, and the relapse rate (RR) was lower for PEAM than BEAM (22.9% vs 45.6%). Median time to relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS) were not reached for either group. PEAM exhibited a shorter time to both neutrophil (NE) and platelet (PE) engraftment compared to BEAM (10 vs 12 days), with a more tolerable gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity profile. CONCLUSIONS: Both BEAM and PEAM showed similar outcomes, demonstrating comparable efficacy in terms of ORR, TTR, and OS for both HL and NHL patients. However, PEAM-conditioning was associated with a shorter time to engraftment and fewer GI adverse events.
Targeted delivery of carmustine (BCNU), an efficient brain tumor therapeutic, has been challenged with bioavailability issues due to the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). The currently effective delivery approach is by implants at the site of the tumor, but this is highly invasive. The intranasal route, which is non-invasive and bypasses the BBB, may be alternative route for delivering BCNU to the brain. In this work, polyvinyl alcohol/polyethyleneimine/fIuorecein isothiocyanate complex (Polyplex) coated iron-oxide nanoparticles (Magnetite) were synthesized employing co-precipitation, epoxidation and EDC/NHS coupling reactions. The Polyplex coated magnetite (Nano-co-Plex) was loaded with BCNU for potential magnetically targeted delivery to the brain following intranasal administration. The Nano-co-Plex was characterized employing Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Zetasize analysis. Results revealed superparamagnetic hexagonally shaped "core-shell" nanoparticles with cell labeling attributes, of size ranging between 30-50 nm, and a zeta potential value of + 32 +/- 2 mV. The Nano-co-Plex synthesized was found to possess high degree of crystallinity with 32% Polyplex coating. The loading and release studies indicated a time-dependent loading with maximum loading capacity of 176.82 mug BCNU/mg of the carrier and maximum release of 75.8% of the loaded BCNU. Cytotoxicity of the BCNU-loaded Nano-co-Plex displayed superiority over the conventional BCNU towards human glioblastoma (HG) cells. Cell studies revealed enhanced uptake and internalization of BCNU-loaded Nano-co-plex in HG cells in the presence of an external magnetic field. These Nano-co-Plexes may be ideal as an intranasal magnetic drug targeting device for BCNU delivery.
Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We have developed a novel conditioning regimen called CEAC (oral semustine 250 mg/m(2) d-6, etoposide 300 mg/m(2) d-5 ~ d-2, cytarabine 500 mg/m(2) d-5 ~ d-2, and cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m(2) d-5 ~ d-2) In lymphoma patients in China. Here, we conducted a study to compare the conventional BEAM regimen with the CEAC regimen in 110 DLBCL patients. Propensity-score matching was performed in a 1:4 ratio (22 patients received BEAM and 88 received CEAC). Our results showed no significant difference in the overall response rate (95% vs 97%, P = 1.000) and complete response rate (66% vs 73%, P = 0.580) between the two cohorts. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), 5-year overall survival (OS), and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) for all patients were 72% (95% CI 62%-82%), 92% (95% CI 86%-97%), and 29% (95% CI 17%-38%), respectively. There was no significant difference in the 5-year PFS (80% vs 70%, P = 0.637), 5-year OS (95% vs 91%, P = 0.496), and 5-year CIR (20% vs 30%, P = 0.733) between cohorts. In terms of safety, the CEAC cohort had a lower incidence rate of grade 1-2 gastrointestinal hemorrhage (P = 0.023) and severe nausea (P = 0.007) compared with the BEAM cohort. In conclusion, the CEAC regimen seems to be a suitable alternative to the BEAM regimen for ASCT in DLBCL patients.
