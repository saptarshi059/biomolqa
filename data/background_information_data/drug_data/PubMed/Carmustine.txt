Glioblastoma is the most common adult malignant primary brain tumor. Despite the advances in therapeutic options, survival of patients with glioblastoma remains dismal at 15-18 months. Current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is maximal possible safe resection consistent with the preservation of neurologic function followed by concurrent temozolomide with radiation and adjuvant. Treatment options at recurrence include surgical resection with or without the placement of carmustine wafers, re-irradiation and chemotherapeutics such as nitrosoureas (lomustine, carmustine) or bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
Evolving research has demonstrated that surgical cytoreduction of a high-grade glial neoplasm is an important factor in improving the prognosis of these difficult tumors. Recent advances in intraoperative imaging have spurred the use of stereotactic laser ablation (laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT]) for intracranial lesions. Among other targets, laser ablation has been used in the focal treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). The revived application of laser ablation for gliomas parallels major advancements in intraoperative adjuvants and groundbreaking molecular advances in neuro-oncology. The authors review the research on stereotactic LITT for the treatment of HGGs and provide a potential management algorithm for HGGs that incorporates LITT in clinical practice.
Chemotherapeutic treatment of malignant gliomas is extremely challenging. Tumor accumulation of systemically-administrated chemotherapy is always hindered by the blood-brain barrier(BBB). Although temozolomide administered orally or intravenously represents the standard of care for malignant gliomas, its efficacy is unsatisfactory. Local chemotherapy bypasses the BBB and, therefore, achieves a high drug concentration at the site the drug is administered. Carmustine wafers are clinically available local chemotherapeutic agents. However, their efficacy is limited because of limited drug penetration into the tumor. Combined with the highly chemoresistant features of glioma itself, ongoing chemotherapy is far from satisfactory in terms of efficacy. This review covers several important issues regarding temozolomide chemotherapy, including the reactivation of hepatitis B virus, assessment of MGMT promoter methylation, and pseudo-progression. Local chemotherapy for newly diagnosed resectable glioblastoma cases using carmustine wafers is currently under investigation with a randomized phase 3 trial (JCOG 1703), which will also be discussed. In addition, recent progress in convection-enhanced delivery of chemotherapeutics against gliomas has also been reported. Development of an alternative strategy to effectively deliver drugs to the tumor site may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy against gliomas in the near future.
BACKGROUND: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common clinicopathologic subtype of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: The therapy of MF is highlighted in this overview. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Skin-directed MF therapies include topical corticosteroids, nitrogen mustard, carmustine (BCNU), topical bexarotene gel, imiquimod cream, radiotherapy, total skin electron beam therapy, and phototherapy. Systemic therapies include extracorporeal photopheresis, interferon, oral bexarotene, denileukin diftitox, monoclonal antibodies and cytokine therapy, and other systemic chemotherapy. Finally, some investigative therapeutic modalities are presented.
The 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU; carmustine) polymer wafer (Gliadel) was developed for use in malignant glioma to deliver higher doses of chemotherapy directly to tumor tissue while bypassing systemic side effects. Phase III clinical trials for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas demonstrated a small, but statistically significant, improvement in survival. However, the rate of complications, including an increase in cerebrospinal fluid leaks and intracranial hypertension, has limited their use. This article reviews the current data for use of BCNU wafers in malignant gliomas.
