Methylxanthines represent a unique class of drugs for the treatment of asthma. The methylxanthine theophylline has demonstrated efficacy in attenuating the three cardinal features of asthma - reversible airflow obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. At doses achieving relatively high serum levels in which toxic side effects are sometimes observed, direct bronchodilatory effects of theophylline are recognized. At lower serum concentrations, theophylline is a weak bronchodilator but retains its capacity as an immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory, and bronchoprotective drug. Intense investigation into the molecular mechanisms of action of theophylline has identified several different points of action. Phosphodiesterase inhibition and adenosine receptor antagonism have both been implicated in promoting airway smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Similar mechanisms of action may explain the inhibitory effects of theophylline on immune cells. At lower concentrations that fail to inhibit phosphodiesterase, effects on histone deacetylase activity are believed to contribute to the immunomodulatory actions of theophylline. Since anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of methylxanthines are realized at lower serum concentrations than are required for bronchodilation, theophylline's predominant role in asthma treatment is as a controller medication for chronic, persistent disease.
Sixty patients with theophylline toxicity were hospitalized during a 2-year period. Eleven patients had hypercalcemia; their calcium levels returned to normal as theophylline levels fell to therapeutic or subtherapeutic levels. Serum calcium levels also fell significantly in three additional patients with theophylline toxicity, although the initial serum calcium concentration was not outside normal limits. A significant increase in serum calcium levels associated with therapeutic levels of theophylline in normal volunteers was reversed by propranolol. It appears that theophylline causes elevation of serum calcium by a system subject to beta-adrenergic regulation.
The effect of posture on theophylline kinetics was examined in six healthy men who took 450 mg slow-release aminophylline orally at the same time of day on two separate occasions. On one day they remained standing and on the other supine throughout. Plasma theophylline was measured hourly for 6 h from ingestion. Mean theophylline levels were significantly higher in the standing position at all times (P less than 0.01). We conclude that diurnal variation in theophylline kinetics can be explained, at least in part, by differences in posture.
The potencies of caffeine, theophylline, lysine-theophylline and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) in stimulating sperm motility have been compared, and we have found IBMX to be significantly more potent than the other three compounds, which did not exhibit significant differences in potency from each other.
Theophylline protein binding was 58-82% in serum from six normal adults and 42 asthmatic patients, 1-25 years old, who were given 5 mg of theophylline/kg. The binding range was greatest in young patients, but the proportion of protein-bound drug did not correlate with age. Theophylline protein binding was higher than previously reported. The effect of binding should be considered in patients who do not have optimal bronchodilation from theophylline despite total serum theophylline concentrations of 10-20 microgram/ml.
