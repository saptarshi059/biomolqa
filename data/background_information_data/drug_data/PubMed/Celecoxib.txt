BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular safety of celecoxib, as compared with nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), remains uncertain. METHODS: Patients who required NSAIDs for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and were at increased cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen. The goal of the trial was to assess the noninferiority of celecoxib with regard to the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death (including hemorrhagic death), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Noninferiority required a hazard ratio of 1.12 or lower, as well as an upper 97.5% confidence limit of 1.33 or lower in the intention-to-treat population and of 1.40 or lower in the on-treatment population. Gastrointestinal and renal outcomes were also adjudicated. RESULTS: A total of 24,081 patients were randomly assigned to the celecoxib group (mean [+/-SD] daily dose, 209+/-37 mg), the naproxen group (852+/-103 mg), or the ibuprofen group (2045+/-246 mg) for a mean treatment duration of 20.3+/-16.0 months and a mean follow-up period of 34.1+/-13.4 months. During the trial, 68.8% of the patients stopped taking the study drug, and 27.4% of the patients discontinued follow-up. In the intention-to-treat analyses, a primary outcome event occurred in 188 patients in the celecoxib group (2.3%), 201 patients in the naproxen group (2.5%), and 218 patients in the ibuprofen group (2.7%) (hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. naproxen, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.13; hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. ibuprofen, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04; P<0.001 for noninferiority in both comparisons). In the on-treatment analysis, a primary outcome event occurred in 134 patients in the celecoxib group (1.7%), 144 patients in the naproxen group (1.8%), and 155 patients in the ibuprofen group (1.9%) (hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. naproxen, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.15; hazard ratio for celecoxib vs. ibuprofen, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02; P<0.001 for noninferiority in both comparisons). The risk of gastrointestinal events was significantly lower with celecoxib than with naproxen (P=0.01) or ibuprofen (P=0.002); the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib than with ibuprofen (P=0.004) but was not significantly lower with celecoxib than with naproxen (P=0.19). CONCLUSIONS: At moderate doses, celecoxib was found to be noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with regard to cardiovascular safety. (Funded by Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00346216 .).
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is generally accepted that inflammatory cells found in the tumor microenvironment are involved in the neoplastic process, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Therefore, administering anti-inflammatory medication in cancer therapy seems to be justified. A potential pathway associated with the aforementioned issue is cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, particularly as the overexpression of this enzyme has been proven to occur in cancer tissues and is also associated with a poor prognosis in several types of human malignancies. Celecoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, has been utilized for over 20 years, particularly as an anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic medication. However, to date, its antineoplastic properties have not been sufficiently investigated. In recent years, the number of research studies on the antineoplastic effects of celecoxib has increased considerably. The vast majority of publications refers to preclinical studies attempting to elucidate its mechanisms of action. Clinical trials concerning celecoxib have focused primarily on the treatment of cancers of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, stomach, head and neck, as well as premalignant lesions such as familial adenoma polyposis. In this review article authors attempt to summarise the latest research which has elucidated celecoxib use in the treatment and prevention of cancer. CONCLUSION: Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising results of the role of celecoxib in the treatment and prevention of cancer - the best outcome was observed in colon, breast, prostate and head and neck cancers. However, more clinical trials providing real evidence-based clinical advances of celecoxib use are needed.
The US Food and Drug Administration recently granted an approved indication for the first fixed-dose combination antihypertensive (amlodipine) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (celecoxib) for treatment of comorbid hypertension and osteoarthritis. This review summarizes available data on this combination product, to be marketed as Consensi (Kitov Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Tel Aviv, Israel), and discusses its potential place in therapy.
Celecoxib is the first COX-2-specific inhibitor approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as for treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis. For both OA and RA, celecoxib has been shown to be significantly superior in efficacy to placebo and similar in efficacy to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Its advantage, however, is its gastrointestinal (GI) safety. Randomized clinical trials as well as long-term outcomes studies have demonstrated that the GI safety profile of celecoxib is superior to that of traditional NSAIDs and similar to that of placebo. Additionally, the renal and cardiovascular safety of celecoxib has also become apparent, as well as its efficacy, tolerability and safety in the elderly population.
The most enthralling and versatile class of drugs called the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) showed its therapeutic utility in inflammation, beginning from the era of classic drug 'Aspirin'. NSAIDs and their well-established action based on inhibiting the COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme leads to blockage of prostaglandin pathway. They further categorized into first generation (non-selective inhibitor) and second generation (selective COX-2 inhibitors). Selective COX-2 inhibitors has advantage over non-selective in terms of their improved safety profile of gastro-intestinal tract. Rejuvenating and recent avenues for COXIBS (selective COX-2 inhibitors) explains its integrated role in identification of biochemical pain signaling as well as its pivotal key role in cancer chemotherapy. A key role player in this class is the Celecoxib (only FDA approved COXIB) a member of Biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) II. Low solubility and bioavailability issues related with celecoxib lead to the development and advancement in the discovery and research of some possible formulation administered either orally, topically or via transdermal route. This review article intent to draw the bead on Celecoxib and it clearly explain extensive knowledge of its disposition profile, its dynamic role in cancer at cellular level and cardiovascular risk assessment. Some of the possible formulations approaches with celecoxib and its improvement aspects are also briefly discussed.
