Herein, we review the recent progress in the synthesis of representative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ibuprofen and naproxen. Although these drugs were discovered over 50 years ago, novel practical and asymmetric approaches are still being developed for their synthesis. In addition, this endeavor has enabled access to more potent and selective derivatives from the key frameworks of ibuprofen and naproxen. The development of a synthetic route to ibuprofen and naproxen over the last 10 years is summarized, including developing methodologies, finding novel synthetic routes, and applying continuous-flow chemistry.
Naproxen is a stereochemically pure nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the 2-arylpropionic acid class. The absorption of naproxen is rapid and complete when given orally. Naproxen binds extensively, in a concentration-dependent manner, to plasma albumin. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of naproxen is linearly proportional to the dose for oral doses up to a total dose of 500 mg. At doses greater than 500 mg there is an increase in the unbound fraction of drug, leading to an increased renal clearance of total naproxen while unbound renal clearance remains unchanged. Substantial concentrations of the drug are attained in synovial fluid, which is a proposed site of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Relationships between the total and unbound plasma concentration, unbound synovial fluid concentration and therapeutic effect have been established. Naproxen is eliminated following biotransformation to glucuroconjugated and sulphate metabolites which are excreted in urine, with only a small amount of the drug being eliminated unchanged. The excretion of the 6-O-desmethylnaproxen metabolite conjugate may be tied to renal function, as accumulation occurs in end-stage renal disease but does not appear to be influenced by age. Hepatic disease and rheumatoid arthritis can also significantly alter the disposition kinetics of naproxen. Although naproxen is excreted into breast milk the amount of drug transferred comprises only a small fraction of the maternal exposure. Significant drug interactions have been demonstrated for probenecid, lithium and methotrexate.
BACKGROUND: The effect of naproxen on the treatment of neoplastic fever is still unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate the effect of naproxen in the treatment of cancer fever or suspicion. Besides, the latest and most convincing evidence was provided for the earlier use of naproxen in treating cancer patients with fever of unknown origin. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify all published studies on the naproxen for the treatment of neoplastic fever. Electronic databases (eg, PUBMED, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) were searched until October 2018. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by 2 authors independently. Standard meta-analyses on the rate of successful treatment were conducted using a random-effects model, and relative risks were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 15 studies, recruiting 582 participants, were included, which were 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), 1 non-RCT, 3 cross-sectional studies, and 10 case-series studies. The result of our meta-analysis revealed that the success rate on the treatment of neoplastic fever using naproxen was 94.1% (95% CI: 87.6%-97.3%). The success rate of the suspected neoplastic fever was 79.8%; for fever of unknown origin, it also reached 67.7%. In this meta-analysis, the success rate was 98.1% (95% CI: 95.0%-99.3%) in the dosage of 250 mg twice a day. Besides, a small dose of 125 mg naproxen, 375 mg twice a day and 250 mg 3 times a day were also useful. The result of the subgroup analysis revealed that the difference was not statistically significant in the treatment success rate for solid tumors and hematologic malignant. CONCLUSIONS: The result of our meta-analysis suggested that naproxen exhibited a highly successful rate for the treatment of neoplastic fever. Besides, naproxen was also satisfactory in improving symptoms of suspected neoplastic fever and fever of unknown origin. The earlier use of naproxen might be able to mitigate cancer patient's suffering and enhanced their quality of life. These findings, however, rely primarily on observational data and should be interpreted rigorously. Further well-conducted trials are required to assess naproxen for the treatment of neoplastic fever.
We have reported what we believe to be the first case of naproxen-associated nightmares. Our brief review of basic sleep physiology and the several questions we have raised might help explain this seemingly unusual adverse effect of naproxen.
Naproxen is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in pediatric population, used for mild-to-moderate pains, arthritis, and other immune-mediated disorders. It rarely causes clinically apparent liver injury in the adult population taking high doses of the drug over a prolonged period and is reported even rarer in pediatric population. We present a case of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a 13-year-old girl taking naproxen in therapeutic doses for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. There was a complete recovery of liver function following discontinuation of naproxen therapy.
