Vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (VIPN) is a very common side effect of vincristine chemotherapy among pediatric patients with cancer. Neuropathy may be sensory, motor and/or autonomic, with consequent reduction, delay or discontinuation of vincristine-chemotherapy, but also pain, disability, reduced quality of life of patients and an increase in medical costs. Vincristine acts out its antineoplastic function by altering the normal assembly and disassembly of microtubules, with their consequent mitosis block and death. Vincristine leads to VIPN through a complex mechanism of damage, which occurs not only on the microtubules, but also on the endothelium and the mitochondria of nerve cells. Furthermore, both patient-related risk factors (age, race, ethnicity and genetic polymorphisms) and treatment-related risk factors (dose, time of infusion and drug-drug interactions) are involved in the pathogenesis of VIPN. There is a lack of consensus about the prophylaxis and treatment of VIPN among pediatric oncologic patients, despite several molecules (such as gabapentin, pyridoxine and pyridostigmine, glutamic acid and glutamine) having been already investigated in clinical trials. This review describes the molecular mechanisms of VIPN and analyzes the risk factors and the principal drugs adopted for the prophylaxis and treatment of VIPN in pediatric patients with cancer.
Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) is a prevalent and painful complication in cancer patients that lacks effective treatments. In this issue of JEM, Starobova et al. (2021. J. Exp. Med.https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20201452) report that VIPN is driven by innate immune system activation, a discovery that unlocks immunotherapies as potential treatments.
Three cases of vincristine-induced megacolon are described with radiographic correlation. Vincristine is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent with neuropathic side effects causing colonic dilatation and constipation. The radiologist should be aware of this entity to prevent unnecessary procedures and, possibly, surgery.
Vincristine is an essential component of rhabdomyosarcoma treatment. However, it can cause motor neurotoxicity, necessitating dose reductions. We retrospectively reviewed the rates and patterns of vincristine-induced motor neuropathy in children treated for rhabdomyosarcoma, and investigated effects on outcome. Fifteen of 43 patients (35%) developed motor neuropathies necessitating dose reductions, which ranged from 1.7% to 58% of planned cumulative dose. Older age was the only significant clinical risk factor. Almost half (47%) recovered during treatment with subsequent dose escalation. Most patients had complete resolution of symptoms upon follow-up. There was no discernible effect of treatment reduction on survival or relapse rates.
Cardiotoxicity, including heart failure, thromboembolic events, and myocardial ischemia, is a concern for cardiologists and oncologists. The most frequently involved drugs are anthracyclines. We report an episode of coronary spasm due to vincristine, a vinca alkaloid, in a 49-year-old man treated for a diffuse undifferentiated carcinoma. The patient suffered recurrent episodes of typical chest pain with ST-elevation in the inferior area. Coronary spasm was confirmed by an angiogram, which showed normal coronary arteries. No recurrence occurred with the medical management. Coronary spasm induced by vincristine is a newly described facet of chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity.
