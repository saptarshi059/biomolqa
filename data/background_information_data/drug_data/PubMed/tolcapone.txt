Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most important age-related neurodegenerative disorder in developed societies, after Alzheimer's disease, with a prevalence ranging from 41 per 100,000 in the fourth decade of life to over 1900 per 100,000 in people over 80 years of age. As a movement disorder, the PD phenotype is characterized by rigidity, resting tremor, and bradykinesia. Parkinson's disease -related neurodegeneration is likely to occur several decades before the onset of the motor symptoms. Potential risk factors include environmental toxins, drugs, pesticides, brain microtrauma, focal cerebrovascular damage, and genomic defects. Parkinson's disease neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, with widespread involvement of other central nervous system (CNS) structures and peripheral tissues. Pathogenic mechanisms associated with genomic, epigenetic and environmental factors lead to conformational changes and deposits of key proteins due to abnormalities in the ubiquitin-proteasome system together with dysregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Conventional pharmacological treatments for PD are dopamine precursors (levodopa, l-DOPA, l-3,4 dihidroxifenilalanina), and other symptomatic treatments including dopamine agonists (amantadine, apomorphine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (entacapone, tolcapone). The chronic administration of antiparkinsonian drugs currently induces the "wearing-off phenomenon", with additional psychomotor and autonomic complications. In order to minimize these clinical complications, novel compounds have been developed. Novel drugs and bioproducts for the treatment of PD should address dopaminergic neuroprotection to reduce premature neurodegeneration in addition to enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission. Since biochemical changes and therapeutic outcomes are highly dependent upon the genomic profiles of PD patients, personalized treatments should rely on pharmacogenetic procedures to optimize therapeutics.
Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) are major strategies to reduce levodopa degradation and thus to increase and prolong its effect in striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission in Parkinson's disease patients. While selegiline/rasagiline and tolcapone/entacapone have been available on the market for more than one decade, safinamide and opicapone have been approved in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, comprehensive data from several post-authorization studies have described the use and specific characteristics of the individual substances in clinical practice under real-life conditions. Here, we summarize current knowledge on both medication classes, with a focus on the added clinical value in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we outline practical considerations in the treatment of motor fluctuations and provide an outlook on ongoing studies with MAO-B and COMT inhibitors.
INTRODUCTION: Gambling disorder (GD) is a mental health condition characterized by persistent and problematic betting behavior. GD generates distress and impairment, and treatment options include psychological and pharmacological interventions. AREAS COVERED: This narrative review explores existing pharmacological treatments for GD. The following classes of medications were considered: opioid-receptor antagonists (e.g. naltrexone and nalmefene), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram), glutamatergic agents (e.g. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), acamprosate, and memantine), mood stabilizers (e.g. topiramate, carbamazepine, lithium), and other medications (e.g. modafinil, nefazodone, olanzapine, haloperidol, tolcapone, and bupropion). EXPERT OPINION: Due to the limitations of the studies reviewed, solid conclusions regarding the optimal choice of pharmacotherapy for individuals with GD are challenging to draw at this time. Despite some medications, such as naltrexone and nalmefene, showing promising results, efficacy has varied across studies. The review highlights current gaps/limitations, including small sample sizes, limited diversity in participant demographics, the need for exploring different gambling subtypes and treatment responses, high placebo response rates, lack of longer-term longitudinal information, limited investigation of neurobiological correlates and co-occurring disorders, and the importance of implementation research. Further research is needed to address these gaps and explore additional medications, as well as interventions like neuromodulation.
INTRODUCTION: Conventional antipsychotic drugs that attenuate dopaminergic neural transmission are ineffective in approximately one-third of patients with schizophrenia. This necessitates the development of non-dopaminergic agents. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for completed phase II and III trials of compounds for schizophrenia treatment using the US Clinical Trials Registry and the EU Clinical Trials Register. Compounds demonstrating significant superiority over placebo in the primary outcome measure in the latest phase II and III trials were identified. Collateral information on the included compounds was gathered through manual searches in PubMed and press releases. RESULTS: Sixteen compounds were identified; four compounds (ulotaront, xanomeline/trospium chloride, vabicaserin, and roluperidone) were investigated as monotherapy and the remaining 12 (pimavanserin, bitopertin, BI 425809, encenicline, tropisetron, pregnenolone, D-serine, estradiol, tolcapone, valacyclovir, cannabidiol, and rimonabant) were examined as add-on therapy. Compared to the placebo, ulotaront, xanomeline/trospium chloride, vabicaserin, bitopertin, estradiol, cannabidiol, rimonabant, and D-serine showed efficacy for positive symptoms; roluperidone and pimavanserin were effective for negative symptoms; and encenicline, tropisetron, pregnenolone, tolcapone, BI 425809, and valacyclovir improved cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Compounds that function differently from existing antipsychotics may offer novel symptom-specific therapeutic strategies for patients with schizophrenia.
BACKGROUND: Despite increasing worldwide incidence of Parkinson's disease, the therapy is still suboptimal due to the diversified clinical manifestations, lack of sufficient treatment, the poor adherence in advanced patients, and varied response. Proper intake of medications regarding food and managing drug-food interactions may optimize Parkinson's disease treatment. OBJECTIVES: We investigated potential effects that food, beverages, and dietary supplements may have on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs used by parkinsonian patients; identified the most probable interactions; and shaped recommendations for the optimal intake of drugs regarding food. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in adherence to PRISMA guidelines, and included a total of 81 studies in the qualitative synthesis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found evidence for levodopa positive interaction with coffee, fiber and vitamin C, as well as for the potential beneficial impact of low-fat and protein redistribution diet. Contrastingly, high-protein diet and ferrous sulfate supplements can negatively affect levodopa pharmacokinetics and effectiveness. For other drugs, the data of food impact are scarce. Based on the available limited evidence, all dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline, ropinirole), tolcapone, rasagiline, selegiline in tablets, safinamide, amantadine and pimavanserin can be taken with or without a meal. Opicapone and orally disintegrating selegiline tablets should be administered on an empty stomach. Of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, safinamide is the least susceptible for interaction with the tyramine-rich food, whereas selegiline and rasagiline may lose selectivity to monoamine oxidase B when administered in supratherapeutic doses. The level of presented evidence is low due to the poor studies design, their insufficient actuality, and missing data.
