A summary is given of the properties of dipyridamole and of the trials at the time this article was written that indicate its potential efficacy in the therapy of glomerulonephritides.
The fixed-dose combination of extended-release dipyridamole/aspirin (Aggrenox/Asasantin Retard) combines 2 antiplatelet agents with different mechanisms of action. The combination reduced thrombus formation in human and animal models. Coadministration of extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin in healthy volunteers had no significant effects on the plasma concentrations of either agent. Twice-daily oral extended-release dipyridamole/aspirin (400/50 mg/day) was twice as effective as either agent alone in the secondary prevention of stroke in a large clinical trial involving patients with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The rate of the combined end-point of stroke and death tended to be lower with the combination than with other treatments. The incidence of death was not significantly reduced by any treatment. Most adverse events with extended-release dipyridamole/aspirin were mild and similar to those with either agent alone. Bleeding was more common with the combination than with extended-release dipyridamole alone, as was headache when compared with aspirin alone. Limited pharmacoeconomic analyses suggest that treatment with extended-release dipyridamole/aspirin was cost saving and was cost effective compared with aspirin monotherapy for the secondary prevention of stroke.
Dipyridamole was first introduced as an antianginal, coronary vasodilator agent. It was soon found that this drug could not prevent effort ischaemia; on the contrary, given intravenously, it could frequently induce ischaemia in the presence of coronary artery stenosis. This property was exploited for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The dipyridamole-induced ischaemia was detected by different techniques: ST-segment depression, thallium 201 scintigraphy and echocardiography. This review article describes the mechanisms underlying dipyridamole-induced ischaemia and discusses the value of this pharmacologic stress test for the detection of coronary artery disease.
The experiment carried out in 6 volunteers shows a better availability of a 75 mg single oral dose of dipyridamole administered at 600 than at 2200. The availability of dipyridamole administered at 600. The dependence of kel and t0.5(elim) on the time of drug administration is less distinct.
The case history of a patient treated with dipyridamole who developed severe epistaxis, accompanied by alteration of the platelet aggregation tests, is presented. The bleeding did not respond to local therapy and stopped only after discontinuation of the drug and normalization of the platelet aggregation. Hemorrhage, especially in elderly patients, should be considered as a possible complication of dipyridamole administration.
