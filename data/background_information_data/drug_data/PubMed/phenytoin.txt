Phenytoin is a long-standing, anti-seizure drug widely used in clinical practice. It has also been evaluated in the context of many other illnesses in addition to its original epilepsy indication. The narrow therapeutic index of phenytoin and its ubiquitous daily use pose a high risk of poisoning. This review article focuses on the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of phenytoin, with a special focus on its mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. The side effects on human health associated with phenytoin use are thoroughly described. In particular, DRESS syndrome and cerebellar atrophy are addressed. This review will help in further understanding the benefits phenytoin use in the treatment of epilepsy.
A 60-year-old man with cerebral palsy and epilepsy was admitted with acute lethargy and deterioration in coordination. He was noted to be hypothermic at 35 degrees C on admission. Routine work-up revealed toxic levels of phenytoin. No cause of hypothermia could be identified but as his phenytoin levels normalised, his body temperature also improved. There are three other reported cases of phenytoin- induced hypothermia in the literature. Could this be a rare cause of hypothermia?
A 15-year-old boy developed thrombocytopenia and purpura two weeks after starting phenytoin therapy. The blood phenytoin level was in the toxic range. There was an increase in immature neutrophils but no abnormalities were present in other cell lines. Recovery was complete after drug therapy was discontinued. Thrombocytopenia is a rare isolated complication of phenytoin therapy. The probable autoimmune etiology distinguishes this syndrome from other phenytoin-induced blood dyscrasias.
Phenytoin is an 80-year young molecule and new indications are still emerging. The neuroprotective potential of phenytoin has been evaluated for decades. Recently, a positive phase II trial supported its further development in the treatment of optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis. In 1942, however, peripheral neuritis was first reported to be an adverse event of phenytoin, and since then a small but steady stream of publications discussed peripheral polyneuropathy as being a possible adverse event of phenytoin. We have reviewed the literature and concluded there is some supportive evidence for a reversible polyneuropathy after the oral use of phenytoin, though with no evidence for clear neurotoxicity on the level of peripheral nerves. This is probably due to the fact that the pharmacological effects of phenytoin, based on the stabilizing effect of the voltage-gated sodium channels, make impairment of nerve conduction in asymptomatic and symptomatic reversible polyneuropathies plausible. Clear toxically-induced phenytoin-related polyneuropathies, however, are extremely rare and are always related to high dose or high plasma levels of phenytoin, mostly developing during many years of therapy. We could only find one case of a probable reversible chronic phenytoin intoxication resulting in a biopsy proven axonal atrophy with secondary demyelination and signs of remyelination. All case series and case reports published are insufficient in detail to prove a clear causal relation between phenytoin intake and the induction of a peripheral polyneuropathy. Phenytoin does not lead to irreversible toxicity of the peripheral nerves and might, on the other hand, have neuroprotective properties.
Fosphenytoin is a phosphate ester prodrug of phenytoin developed as a replacement for standard injectable sodium phenytoin. After absorption, phenytoin is cleaved (conversion half-life 8-15 min) from fosphenytoin. Unlike phenytoin, fosphenytoin is freely soluble in aqueous solutions (including standard intravenous solutions) and rapidly absorbed by the intramuscular route. Fosphenytoin has been tested successfully for three indications in humans: intramuscular maintenance dosing, intramuscular loading dose administration, and intravenous treatment of status epilepticus. Local toxicity (pain, burning, itching) is less by the intramuscular or intravenous route for fosphenytoin than for standard injectable sodium phenytoin. Systemic toxicity is similar with both preparations except that hypotension is less common and paresthesias are more common with fosphenytoin.
