Portal hypertension (PH) is the most common complication ofcirrhosis and represents the main driver of hepatic decompensation. The overarching goal of PH treatments in patients with compensated cirrhosis is to reduce the risk of hepatic decompensation (i.e development of ascites, variceal bleeding and/or hepatic encephalopathy). In decompensated patients, PH-directed therapies aim at avoiding further decompensation (i.e. recurrent/refractory ascites, variceal rebleeding, recurrent encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or hepatorenal syndrome) and at improving survival. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) acting on hyperdynamic circulation/splanchnic vasodilation and on intrahepatic resistance. It has shown superior efficacy than traditional NSBBs in lowering PH in patients with cirrhosis and may be, therefore, the NSBB of choice for the treatment of clinically significant portal hypertension. In primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, carvedilol has been demonstrated to be more effective than endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). In patients with compensated cirrhosis carvedilol achieves higher rate of hemodynamic response than propranolol, resulting in a decreased risk of hepatic decompensation. In secondary prophylaxis, the combination of EVL with carvedilol may prevent rebleeding and non-bleeding further decompensation better than that with propranolol. In patients with ascites and gastroesophageal varices, carvedilol is safe and may improve survival, as long as no impairment of the systemic hemodynamic or renal dysfunction occurs, with maintained arterial blood pressure as suitable safety surrogate. The target dose of carvedilol to treat PH should be 12.5 mg/day. This review summarizes the evidence behind Baveno-VII recommendations on the use of carvedilol in patients with cirrhosis.
Carvedilol has been identified as a promising agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Meanwhile, autophagy and apoptosis have been reported to play key roles in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which can contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. However, the effects of carvedilol on autophagy and apoptosis in HSCs remain unclear. Our study aimed to detect these effects and identify the underlying mechanisms by which carvedilol mediates HSC autophagy and apoptosis. For this purpose, the LX-2 cell line was used in this study, and the cells were exposed to various concentrations of carvedilol for specific times. First, we found that carvedilol increased autophagic marker levels, the number of GFP-LC3-containing puncta and LC3B-II levels in LX-2 cells. Interestingly, the addition of chloroquine (CQ) failed to enhance the effects on GFP-LC3 puncta and LC3B-II levels, and carvedilol treatment resulted in a significant increase in p62 protein levels. Moreover, carvedilol treatment led to the accumulation of yellow dots only in GFP-RFP-LC3-LX-2 cells, similar to the results following CQ treatment, indicating that carvedilol inhibited autophagic flux. Next, we found evidence that carvedilol inhibited autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal pH and not by impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Moreover, carvedilol substantially reduced the viability of LX-2 cells and noticeably induced cell apoptosis, as observed by flow cytometry. In addition, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved PARP, increased Bax activity and decreased Bcl-2 expression were detected in LX-2 cells. Finally, the carvedilol treatment inhibited autophagy and subsequently induced apoptosis in vitro. In conclusion, carvedilol suppresses autophagy and promotes apoptosis in HSCs and the late-stage inhibition of autophagy preceded the induction of apoptosis.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Carvedilol induces stronger decreases in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) than conventional nonselective beta-blockers (ie, propranolol). Limited data exist on the efficacy of carvedilol in secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. METHODS: Patients undergoing paired HVPG measurements for guiding secondary prophylaxis with either carvedilol or propranolol were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients also underwent band ligation. Changes in HVPG and systemic hemodynamics were compared between the 2 groups. Long-term follow-up data on rebleeding, acute kidney injury, nonbleeding decompensation, and liver-related death were analyzed applying competing risk regression. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (carvedilol/propranolol, n = 45/42) were included in our study. The median baseline HVPG was 21 mm Hg (interquartile range, 18-24 mm Hg), and 39.1%/48.3%/12.6% had Child-Turcotte-Pugh A/B/C cirrhosis, respectively. Upon nonselective beta-blocker initiation, HVPG decreased more strongly in carvedilol users (median relative decrease, -20% [interquartile range: -29% to -10%] vs -11% [-22% to -5%] for propranolol; P = .027), who also achieved chronic HVPG response more often (53.3% vs 28.6%; P = .034). Cumulative incidences for rebleeding (Gray test, P = .027) and liver-related death (P = .036) were significantly lower in patients taking carvedilol compared with propranolol. Notably, ascites development/worsening also was observed less commonly in carvedilol patients (P = .012). Meanwhile, acute kidney injury rates did not differ between the 2 groups (P = .255). Stratifying patients by HVPG response status yielded similar results. The prognostic value of carvedilol intake was confirmed in competing risk regression models. CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol induces more marked reductions in HVPG than propranolol in secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, and thus is associated with lower rates of rebleeding, liver-related death, and further nonbleeding decompensation.
Carvedilol ((2RS)-1-(9H-carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]propan-2-ol), a beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocker drug with antioxidant and antiproliferative effects, is indicated for treatment of hypertension, stable angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure. A profile of this drug substance is provided in this chapter and includes physical characteristics of Carvedilol (e.g., UV-vis, IR, NMR, and mass spectra). Details regarding the stability of Carvedilol in the solid state and solution phase are presented and methods of analysis (compendial and literature) are summarized. Furthermore, an account of the pharmacokinetics (ADME) and synthesis of Carvedilol are presented.
Carvedilol is among the most effective beta-blockers for improving survival after myocardial infarction. Yet the mechanisms by which carvedilol achieves this superior clinical profile are still unclear. Beyond blockade of beta(1)-adrenoceptors, arrestin-biased signalling via beta(2)-adrenoceptors is a molecular mechanism proposed to explain the survival benefits. Here, we offer an alternative mechanism to rationalize carvedilol's cellular signalling. Using primary and immortalized cells genome-edited by CRISPR/Cas9 to lack either G proteins or arrestins; and combining biological, biochemical, and signalling assays with molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that G proteins drive all detectable carvedilol signalling through beta(2)ARs. Because a clear understanding of how drugs act is imperative to data interpretation in basic and clinical research, to the stratification of clinical trials or to the monitoring of drug effects on the target pathway, the mechanistic insight gained here provides a foundation for the rational development of signalling prototypes that target the beta-adrenoceptor system.
