Labetalol is a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent for oral and intravenous use in the treatment of hypertension. It is a nonselective antagonist at beta-adrenoceptors and a competitive antagonist of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Labetalol is more potent at beta that at alpha 1 adrenoceptors in man; the ratio of beta-alpha antagonism is 3:1 after oral and 6.9:1 after intravenous administration. Labetalol is readily absorbed in man after oral administration, but the drug, which is lipid soluble, undergoes considerable hepatic first-pass metabolism and has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 25%. There are no active metabolites, and the elimination half-life of the drug is approximately 6 hours. Unlike conventional beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, labetalol, when given acutely, produces a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure with little alteration in heart rate or cardiac output. However, like conventional beta-blockers, labetalol may influence the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and respiratory function. Clinical studies have shown that the antihypertensive efficacy of labetalol is superior to placebo and to diuretic therapy and is at least comparable to that of conventional beta-blockers, methyldopa, clonidine and various adrenergic neuronal blockers. Labetalol administered alone or with a diuretic is often effective when other antihypertensive regimens have failed. Studies have shown that labetalol is effective in the treatment of essential hypertension, renal hypertension, pheochromocytoma, pregnancy hypertension and hypertensive emergencies. In addition, preliminary studies indicate that labetalol may be of value in the management of ischemic heart disease. The most troublesome side effect of labetalol therapy is posture-related dizziness. Other reported side effects of the drug include gastrointestinal disturbances, tiredness, headache, scalp tingling, skin rashes, urinary retention and impotence. Side effects related to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of labetalol, including asthma, heart failure and Raynaud's phenomenon, have been reported in rare instances.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether readmission for hypertension by 6 weeks postpartum differed between patients discharged on nifedipine or labetalol. METHODS: This cohort study included patients with delivery admissions from 2006 to 2017 who were discharged from the hospital on nifedipine or labetalol and were included in a large, national adjudicated claims database. We identified patients' discharge medication based on filled outpatient prescriptions. We compared rates of hospital readmission for hypertension between patients discharged postpartum on labetalol alone, nifedipine alone, or combined nifedipine and labetalol. Patients with chronic hypertension without superimposed preeclampsia were excluded. Comparisons based on medication were performed using logistic regression models with adjustment for prespecified confounders. Comparisons were also stratified by hypertensive disorder of pregnancy severity. RESULTS: Among 1,582,335 patients overall, 14,112 (0.89%) were discharged postpartum on labetalol, 9,001 (0.57%) on nifedipine, and 1,364 (0.09%) on both medications. Postpartum readmissions for hypertension were more frequent for patients discharged on labetalol compared with nifedipine (641 patients vs 185 patients, 4.5% vs 2.1%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.43-1.85). Readmissions for hypertension were more frequent for patients discharged on labetalol compared with nifedipine for both mild (4.5% vs 2.7%, aOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.29-1.93) and severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (261 patients vs 72 patients, 5.7% vs 3.2%, aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.43-1.85). Readmissions for hypertension were more frequent on combined nifedipine and labetalol compared with nifedipine (3.1% vs 2.1%), but the odds were lower after confounder adjustment (aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99). CONCLUSION: Postpartum discharge on labetalol was associated with increased risk of readmission for hypertension compared with discharge on nifedipine.
PURPOSE: Antihypertensive drugs are among the most prescribed drugs during pregnancy. Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine have been perceived safe to use during pregnancy and are therefore recommended in international guidelines for treatment of hypertension. In this review, we provide a complete overview of what is known on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the antihypertensive drugs methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine throughout pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic search was performed to retrieve studies on the PK of methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine used throughout pregnancy. The search was restricted to English and original studies. The systematic search was conducted on July 27, 2021, in Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Keywords were methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine, pharmacokinetics, pregnancy, and placenta. RESULTS: A total of 1459 unique references were identified of which title and abstract were screened. Based on this screening, 67 full-text papers were assessed, to retain 30 PK studies of which 2 described methyldopa, 12 labetalol, and 16 nifedipine. No fetal accumulation is found for any of the antihypertensive drugs studied. CONCLUSION: We conclude that despite decades of prescribing methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine throughout pregnancy, descriptions of their PK during pregnancy are hampered by a large heterogeneity in the low number of available studies. Aiming for evidence-based and personalized dosing of antihypertensive medication in the future, further studies on the relationship of both PK and pharmacodynamics (including the optimal blood pressure targeting) during pregnancy and pregnancy-related pathology are urgently needed to prevent undertreatment, overtreatment, and side effects.
1 A new anti-hypertensive agent (labetalol) with alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking properties has been assessed in 30 patients in a general practice. 2 Significant reduction in blood pressure and pulse rate occurred at a dose of 400 mg/d. A further significant reduction in blood pressure but not of pulse rate occurred at a dose of 800 mg/d. 3 After 4 weeks' treatment on the higher dose the mean fall in systolic and diastolic pressures compared with the pre-trial pressures was 36 and 24 mmHg, respectively. Side-effects were generally mild.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes by type of antihypertensive used in participants of the CHAP (Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy) trial. METHODS: We conducted a planned secondary analysis of CHAP, an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial of antihypertensive treatment compared with standard care (no treatment unless severe hypertension developed) in pregnant patients with mild chronic hypertension (blood pressure 140-159/90-104 mm Hg before 20 weeks of gestation) and singleton pregnancies. We performed three comparisons based on medications prescribed at enrollment: labetalol compared with standard care, nifedipine compared with standard care, and labetalol compared with nifedipine. Although active compared with standard care groups were randomized, medication assignment within the active treatment group was not random but based on clinician or patient preference. The primary outcome was the occurrence of superimposed preeclampsia with severe features, preterm birth before 35 weeks of gestation, placental abruption, or fetal or neonatal death. The key secondary outcome was small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. We also compared medication adverse effects between groups. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated with log binomial regression to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: Of 2,292 participants analyzed, 720 (31.4%) received labetalol, 417 (18.2%) received nifedipine, and 1,155 (50.4%) received no treatment. The mean gestational age at enrollment was 10.5+/-3.7 weeks; nearly half of participants (47.5%) identified as non-Hispanic Black; and 44.5% used aspirin. The primary outcome occurred in 217 (30.1%), 130 (31.2%), and 427 (37.0%) in the labetalol, nifedipine, and standard care groups, respectively. Risk of the primary outcome was lower among those receiving treatment (labetalol use vs standard adjusted RR 0.82, 95% CI, 0.72-0.94; nifedipine use vs standard adjusted RR 0.84, 95% CI, 0.71-0.99), but there was no significant difference in risk when labetalol was compared with nifedipine (adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI, 0.82-1.18). There were no significant differences in SGA or serious adverse events between participants receiving labetalol and those receiving nifedipine. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in predetermined maternal or neonatal outcomes were detected on the basis of the use of labetalol or nifedipine for treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy.
