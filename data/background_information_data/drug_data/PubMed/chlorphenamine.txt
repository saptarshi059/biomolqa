Systemic contact dermatitis (SCD) traditionally refers to a skin condition where an individual who is cutaneously sensitized to an allergen will subsequently react to that same allergen or a cross reacting allergen via a different route. It occurs to allergens including metals, medications, and foods. The exact pathophysiology underlying this disease remains unknown, although it appears to be mediated by type 4 hypersensitivity reactions and possibly type 3 hypersensitivity reactions. The p-I concept (pharmacologic interaction with immunoreceptors) hypothesized that drugs are able to bind directly to a T cell receptor without first being presented by MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules and without prior metabolism, which would help explain why SCD can be seen on first exposure to medications. Nomenclature remains a challenge as SCD can be subcategorized using terms such as ACDS (allergic contact dermatitis syndrome) and its four clinical stages, Baboon syndrome, and SDRIFE (symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema), which share many overlapping features. Food allergens may be responsible for uncontrolled or persistent symptoms in patients with contact dermatitis who do not respond to topical avoidance. With medications, symptoms may be induced by topical application versus systemic administration. Patch testing (PT) may be beneficial in diagnosing SCD caused by metals and many topical medications including corticosteroids, antimicrobials (ampicillin, bacitracin, erythromycin, neomycin, nystatin), NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen), anesthetics, and antihistamines (chlorphenamine, piperazine). Current treatment options include topical steroids and oral antihistamines for symptom relief and dietary avoidance to causative foods or metals.
Chlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM), also known as chlorphenamine, is a potent alkylamine first-generation H1 antihistamine that has been used since the 1950s. CPM is a widely popular drug commonly used to treat allergic conditions, given its antihistamine properties. Although mainly used in over-the-counter treatment for cough and colds, various studies discuss a wide range of CPM's clinical uses, such as treating asthma, plasma cell gingivitis, chronic urticaria, and depression, among others. This antihistamine is usually taken orally; however, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes have been documented. Intranasal routes of this drug have recently been explored, especially due to its antiviral properties against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Accordingly, given CPM's extensive medical and safety profile, the present review explores this versatile drug's current and potential clinical applications. Although it is widely used mainly for treating common colds and aforementioned allergic conditions, CPM can be used for other clinical indications. The repurposing of CPM for other clinical indications, such as COVID-19, needs to be further explored through more extensive studies.
The common cold is the most frequent upper respiratory viral infection. Although benign, it represents a high socioeconomic burden. Many over-the-counter drugs are available to manage the symptoms of this condition, with antihistamines and vasoconstrictors being the most widely used. This review aimed to compare the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy and safety of chlorphenamine and pseudoephedrine, the most commonly used agents in these two classes of drugs, and provide a useful perspective to impact appropriate decisions when considering these options for symptomatic common cold treatment. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we systematically reviewed the use of pseudoephedrine and chlorphenamine using various databases, including MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase. We also perused the bibliographies of relevant articles and the EudraVigilance database. The findings suggest that pseudoephedrine may offer specific benefits in rapidly alleviating nasal congestion in the short term. Chlorphenamine appears to exhibit a higher degree of efficacy in alleviating rhinorrhea and other specific cold symptoms compared to pseudoephedrine. Pharmacovigilance data and case report reviews showed that pseudoephedrine may induce a higher incidence of less common but potentially life-threatening adverse effects compared to chlorphenamine. We concluded that antihistamine drugs exhibit a more favorable benefit/risk profile than vasoconstrictors for treating symptomatic common colds.
The aim of this review was to describe a patient with serotonin toxicity after an overdose of dextromethorphan and chlorphenamine and to perform a systematic literature review exploring whether dextromethorphan and chlorphenamine may be equally contributory in the development of serotonin toxicity in overdose. A Medline literature review was undertaken to identify cases of serotonin toxicity due to dextromethorphan and/or chlorphenamine. Case reports were included if they included information on the ingested dose or plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and/or chlorphenamine, information about co-ingestions and detailed clinical information to evaluate for serotonin toxicity. Cases were reviewed by two toxicologists and serotonin toxicity, defined by the Hunter criteria, was diagnosed when appropriate. The literature was then reviewed to evaluate whether chlorphenamine may be a serotonergic agent. One hundred and fifty-five articles of dextromethorphan or chlorphenamine poisoning were identified. There were 23 case reports of dextromethorphan, of which 18 were excluded for lack of serotonin toxicity. No cases were identified in which serotonin toxicity could be solely attributed to chlorphenamine. This left six cases of dextrometorphane and/or chlorphenamine overdose, including our own, in which serotonin toxicity could be diagnosed based on the presented clinical information. In three of the six eligible cases dextromethorphan and chlorphenamine were the only overdosed drugs. There is substantial evidence from the literature that chlorphenamine is a similarly potent serotonin re-uptake inhibitor when compared with dextrometorphan. Chlorphenamine is a serotonergic medication and combinations of chlorphenamine and dextromethorphan may be dangerous in overdose due to an increased risk of serotonin toxicity.
Pharmacokinetics of diphenidol (DPN) is limited due to the lack of analytical methodology. Here, a micro-assay for DPN quantification was developed, by coupling ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure involved plasma precipitation and injection of supernatant into UPLC with an Acquitytrade mark C18 column. Detection was in positive electrospray, following transitions of m/z 310.3 --> 292.3 and m/z 275.3 --> 230.2 for DPN and chlorphenamine (internal standard), respectively. The method was linear with a range of 4-400 ng/mL, and a 2 min run time. This method was applied in a switchability trial, where both formulations of DPN were bioequivalent.
