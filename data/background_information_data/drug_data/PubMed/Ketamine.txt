Over the last two decades, the dissociative anaesthetic agent ketamine, an uncompetitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has emerged as a novel therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), demonstrating rapid and robust antidepressant effects within hours of administration. Ketamine is a racemic mixture composed of equal amounts of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine. Although ketamine currently remains an off-label treatment for TRD, an (S)-ketamine nasal spray has been approved for use in TRD (in conjunction with an oral antidepressant) in the United States and Europe. Despite the promise of ketamine, key challenges including how to maintain response, concerns regarding short and long-term side-effects and the potential for abuse remain. This review provides an overview of the history of ketamine, its use in psychiatry and its basic pharmacology. The clinical evidence for the use of ketamine in depression and potential adverse effects associated with treatment are summarized. A synopsis of some of the putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant effects is provided before finally outlining future research directions, including the need to identify biomarkers for predicting response and treatment targets that may be used in the development of next-generation rapid-acting antidepressants that may lack ketamine's side-effects or abuse potential.
Ketamine, a racemic mixture consisting of (S)- and (R)-ketamine, has been in clinical use since 1970. Although best characterized for its dissociative anesthetic properties, ketamine also exerts analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant actions. We provide a comprehensive review of these therapeutic uses, emphasizing drug dose, route of administration, and the time course of these effects. Dissociative, psychotomimetic, cognitive, and peripheral side effects associated with short-term or prolonged exposure, as well as recreational ketamine use, are also discussed. We further describe ketamine's pharmacokinetics, including its rapid and extensive metabolism to norketamine, dehydronorketamine, hydroxyketamine, and hydroxynorketamine (HNK) metabolites. Whereas the anesthetic and analgesic properties of ketamine are generally attributed to direct ketamine-induced inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, other putative lower-affinity pharmacological targets of ketamine include, but are not limited to, gamma-amynobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, serotonin, sigma, opioid, and cholinergic receptors, as well as voltage-gated sodium and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. We examine the evidence supporting the relevance of these targets of ketamine and its metabolites to the clinical effects of the drug. Ketamine metabolites may have broader clinical relevance than was previously considered, given that HNK metabolites have antidepressant efficacy in preclinical studies. Overall, pharmacological target deconvolution of ketamine and its metabolites will provide insight critical to the development of new pharmacotherapies that possess the desirable clinical effects of ketamine, but limit undesirable side effects.
Ketamine and esketamine have rapid-onset antidepressant effects and may be considered for the management of treatment-resistant depression. Intranasal esketamine has regulatory approval in the United States and European Union. Intravenous ketamine is often administered off-label as an antidepressant, though no standard operating procedures exist. Repeated administrations and the use of a concurrent standard antidepressant may maintain antidepressant effects of ketamine/esketamine. Possible adverse effects of ketamine and esketamine include psychiatric, cardiovascular, neurologic and genitourinary effects, and the potential for abuse. The long-term safety and efficacy of ketamine/esketamine as antidepressants require further study.
Ketamine has rapid yet often transient antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Different strategies have been proposed to prolong these effects. Maintenance ketamine treatment appears promising, but little is known about its efficacy, safety, and tolerability in depression. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library and identified three randomised controlled trials, eight open-label trials, and 30 case series and reports on maintenance ketamine treatment. We found intravenous, intranasal, oral, and possibly intramuscular and subcutaneous maintenance ketamine treatment to be effective in sustaining antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression. Tachyphylaxis, cognitive impairment, addiction, and serious renal and urinary problems seem uncommon. Despite the methodological limitations, we conclude that from a clinical view, maintenance ketamine treatment seems to be of therapeutic potential. We recommend both controlled and naturalistic studies with long-term follow-up and sufficient power to determine the position of maintenance ketamine treatment within routine clinical practice.
INTRODUCTION: Ketamine can produce rapid-acting antidepressant effects. Esketamine (Spravato), the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant depression in 2019. Here we review what is known about the long-term safety of both racemic ketamine and esketamine as therapies for psychiatric disorders. AREAS COVERED: In this article, we conducted a safety review of ketamine and esketamine. In looking at ketamine and esketamine long-term safety effects, we considered data available from experimental studies and several phase-three clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: Based on available data, the most common side effects of ketamine/esketamine are generally transient, mild, and self-limited. These include dissociation, nausea, headache, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure. Treatment with esketamine may lead to an increased risk of lower urinary tract symptoms, such as dysuria or urgency. However, severe bladder pathology has not been reported among patients receiving doses of esketamine/ketamine in line with prescribing guidelines for depression. There is considerable data that ketamine at high doses can lead to long-term impairments in cognition. However, the esketamine clinical trials found that cognition generally remains stable or improves over time, suggesting that when used appropriately, there is no increased risk of cognitive impairment.
