Introduction: For 30 years, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) has been the backbone of therapeutic management in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In the biologic era, it still remains the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. Positioning of this therapeutic class in moderate-to-severe UC is less clear.Areas covered: Several studies demonstrated the ability of 5-ASA to induce endoscopic remission to a similar extent as anti-TNF therapy on the moderate segment of UC. Histologic remission is achieved after induction in up to 45% of patients treated with topical 5-ASA and 30% with oral formulations. Aminosalicylates offer a favorable safety profile compared to that of immunomodulators and biologics. High-dose 5-ASA therapy may be a valuable option for patients with moderately active disease, and physicians should weigh the pros and cons of this strategy in selected patients. Whether aminosalicylates should be continued in combination with thiopurines or biologic therapy remains under debate.Expert opinion: In the era of biologics, aminosalicylates remain the first-line therapy in patients with mild UC, and have to be considered in case of moderate UC, given their favorable risk-benefit profile. We suggest that 5-ASA should be used in moderate patients without poor prognostic factors, while biologics should be preferred otherwise.
A 38 year-old man with ulcerative colitis recently treated with balsalazide was admitted with chest pain. Investigations demonstrated myocardial necrosis, ECG changes, echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities but normal epicardial coronary arteries and no LV scar on cardiac MRI. Myocarditis was diagnosed and balsalazide therapy was withdrawn, resulting in a full recovery and resolution of abnormalities.
5-aminosalicylates remain the first-line treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis. A number of formulations are available for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis, including encapsulated mesalazine and mesalazine in combination with other molecules. Balsalazide is an aminosalicylate prodrug that releases mesalazine in the colon, thus exerting its multiple anti-inflammatory effects in areas of colitis. This review will examine the pharmacological and therapeutic features of balsalazide as an anti-inflammatory agent in ulcerative colitis. The introduction of novel aminosalicylate formulations and an appreciation of their molecular mode of action, has renewed interest in these agents in both maintenance of disease remission and cancer prevention.
Balsalazide is a prodrug of mesalazine which has an inert carrier molecule instead of the sulfapyridine moiety of sulfasalazine. Balsalazide 6.75 g/day was more effective than mesalazine 2.4 g/day in at least 1 trial and as effective as sulfasalazine 3 g/day for inducing remission in patients with acute ulcerative colitis in 8- and 12-week trials. Moreover, complete symptom relief occurred more promptly with balsalizide 6.75 g/day than with mesalazine 2.4g/day. In long term studies, balsalazide 2 g/day was as effective as sulfasalazine 2 g/day and balsalazide 6 g/day was as effective as mesalazine 1.5 g/day, in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. The tolerability profile of balsalazide is significantly better than that of sulfasalazine; 70% of sulfasalazine-intolerant patients were able to tolerate balsalazide.
