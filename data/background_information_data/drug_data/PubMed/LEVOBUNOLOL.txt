TOPIC: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a highly prevalent condition worldwide and the most common cause of irreversible sight loss. The objective is to assess the comparative effectiveness of first-line medical treatments in patients with POAG or ocular hypertension through a systematic review and network meta-analysis, and to provide relative rankings of these treatments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment for POAG currently relies completely on lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP). Although topical drops, lasers, and surgeries can be considered in the initial treatment of glaucoma, most patients elect to start treatment with eye drops. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a single active topical medication with no treatment/placebo or another single topical medication. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Food and Drug Administration's website. Two individuals independently assessed trial eligibility, abstracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed Bayesian network meta-analyses. RESULTS: We included 114 RCTs with data from 20 275 participants. The overall risk of bias of the included trials is mixed. The mean reductions (95% credible intervals) in IOP in millimeters of mercury at 3 months ordered from the most to least effective drugs were as follows: bimatoprost 5.61 (4.94; 6.29), latanoprost 4.85 (4.24; 5.46), travoprost 4.83 (4.12; 5.54), levobunolol 4.51 (3.85; 5.24), tafluprost 4.37 (2.94; 5.83), timolol 3.70 (3.16; 4.24), brimonidine 3.59 (2.89; 4.29), carteolol 3.44 (2.42; 4.46), levobetaxolol 2.56 (1.52; 3.62), apraclonidine 2.52 (0.94; 4.11), dorzolamide 2.49 (1.85; 3.13), brinzolamide 2.42 (1.62; 3.23), betaxolol 2.24 (1.59; 2.88), and unoprostone 1.91 (1.15; 2.67). CONCLUSIONS: All active first-line drugs are effective compared with placebo in reducing IOP at 3 months. Bimatoprost, latanoprost, and travoprost are among the most efficacious drugs, although the within-class differences were small and may not be clinically meaningful. All factors, including adverse effects, patient preferences, and cost, should be considered in selecting a drug for a given patient.
Superior oblique myokymia (SOM) is a rare condition of unclear etiology. We discuss the history, etiology, clinical features, differential diagnoses, management, and prognosis of SOM. We conducted a meta-analysis of all 116 cases published since SOM was first described in 1906. The age at examination was 17-72 years (mean: 42 years.) There was a right-sided preponderance in 61% of cases (P < 0.02) that was statistically significant in females (63%, P < 0.04) but not in males (59%, P = 0.18). The pathophysiology of SOM may be neurovascular compression and/or ephaptic transmission. Although various pharmacological and surgical approaches to SOM treatment have been proposed, the rarity of the condition has made it impossible to conduct clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of these approaches. Recently, topical beta blockers have managed SOM symptoms in a number of cases, including the first case treated with levobunolol. Systemic medications, strabismus surgery, and neurosurgery have been used to control symptoms, with strabismus surgery carrying a moderate risk of postoperative diplopia in downgaze. Although there is no established treatment for SOM, we encourage clinicians to attempt topical levobunolol therapy before considering systemic therapy or surgery.
A review of the literature has identified 10 agents causing contact dermatitis among topically administered drugs for glaucoma. These agents include beta-blockers (timolol, befunolol, betaxolol, levobunolol, carteolol, metipranolol), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (dorzolamide), a parasympathomimetic (pilocarpine), and sympathomimetics (dipivefrin, apraclonidine). Patch testing has been documented in certain individuals as well as cross sensitization and reactivity. Systemic reactions to these topically applied medications have been briefly noted.
Literature on human plasma concentrations after instillation of ocular timolol, levobunolol, atropine, cyclopentolate, scopolamine, phenylephrine, betamethasone and technetium Tc 99m and theories of lacrimal drainage were reviewed. In all studies the eyedrops absorbed rapidly into the systemic circulation. Like the kinetics of the tracer substances in lacrimal scintigraphy, the plasma drug levels showed interindividual variations. Plasma levels of ocular drugs were lower when punctal occlusion was applied, the mechanism, however, could not be explained. Since an early and a late plasma peak was occasionally registered in some subjects in timolol and cyclopentolate studies, it is suggested that systemic absorption of ocular drugs is low during the nasolacrimal passage but occurs during conjunctival and nasal contact.
Four patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma developed a dendriform corneal epithelial lesion. Two were associated with the use of topical betaxolol for 2 months and 6 weeks, and two were related to topical levobunolol. Resolution occurred within 2 weeks of discontinuation of the beta-blocker eyedrop. The distinctive pattern of dendritic epithelial keratopathy associated with these topical medications may be due to epithelial toxicity with subsequent regeneration.
