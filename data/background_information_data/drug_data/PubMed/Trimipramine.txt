Drug-induced parotitis is a relatively uncommon adverse drug reaction. Most of the data on drug-induced parotitis consist of isolated case reports with few attempts at rechallenge to confirm the aetiology. Phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone have a significant number of reports suggesting that these drugs may be implicated in causing parotitis. Antipsychotics, particularly thioridazine, have been associated with parotitis. Most of these reports relate the anticholinergic oral drying as a predisposing factor in the development of a parotid gland infection. There is inadequate literature on the histamine (H2) receptor blockers, interferon-alpha, doxycycline, trimipramine, nifedipine, methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, nicardipine, isoproterenol or ritodrine to link them as aetiological agents in the development of parotitis.
BACKGROUND: Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep (e.g. sleep onset, maintenance, early waking, impairment of daytime functioning). Insomnia disorder impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. hypnotic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs) are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of psychological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults. SEARCH METHODS: This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to 2015). We updated the searches to December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or older) with a primary diagnosis of insomnia and all participant types including people with comorbidities. Any antidepressant as monotherapy at any dose whether compared with placebo, other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs), a different antidepressant, waiting list control or treatment as usual. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data using a data extraction form. A third review author resolved disagreements on inclusion or data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 23 RCTs (2806 participants).Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo: three studies (135 participants) compared SSRIs with placebo. Combining results was not possible. Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in subjective sleep measures at six (60 participants, P = 0.03) and 12 weeks (27 participants, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the fluoxetine study (low quality evidence).There were either no adverse events or they were not reported (very low quality evidence).Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compared with placebo: six studies (812 participants) compared TCA with placebo; five used doxepin and one used trimipramine. We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four studies (518 participants) could be pooled, showing a moderate improvement in subjective sleep quality over placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.21) (moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence suggested that TCAs possibly improved sleep efficiency (mean difference (MD) 6.29 percentage points, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; 4 studies; 510 participants) and increased sleep time (MD 22.88 minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no impact on sleep latency (MD -4.27 minutes, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; 4 studies; 510 participants).There may have been little or no difference in adverse events between TCAs and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 6 studies; 812 participants) (low quality evidence).'Other' antidepressants with placebo: eight studies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mianserin and seven used trazodone). Three studies (370 participants) of trazodone could be pooled, indicating a moderate improvement in subjective sleep outcomes over placebo (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02). Two studies of trazodone measured polysomnography and found little or no difference in sleep efficiency (MD 1.38 percentage points, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63; 169 participants) (low quality evidence).There was low quality evidence from two studies of more adverse effects with trazodone than placebo (i.e. morning grogginess, increased dry mouth and thirst). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations. The effects of SSRIs compared with placebo are uncertain with too few studies to draw clear conclusions. There may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-term use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone compared with placebo. The tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events. There was no evidence for amitriptyline (despite common use in clinical practice) or for long-term antidepressant use for insomnia. High-quality trials of antidepressants for insomnia are needed.
Introduction: Pregnancy-related physiological changes exert a crucial impact on the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants; however, the current evidence presents inconsistencies. A clearer understanding of pregnancy-related effects on antidepressant disposition may facilitate the development of guidelines for appropriate dose adjustments during the course of pregnancy based on therapeutic drug monitoring.Areas covered: We systematically reviewed studies comparing antidepressant levels in the same individuals during pregnant and non-pregnant states. Using dose-adjusted plasma concentration measurements, we estimated alteration ratios between the 3rd trimester and baseline (before or after pregnancy). Additionally, we performed a meta-analysis for changes in dose-adjusted concentrations to estimate mean differences.Expert opinion: Data for several antidepressants display clear alteration patterns during pregnancy. On the basis of the alteration ratios trimipramine, fluvoxamine, and nortriptyline show a prominent decrease in dose-adjusted levels, especially in the 3rd trimester. Clomipramine, imipramine, citalopram, and paroxetine show smaller decreases in dose-adjusted concentrations in the third trimester. For escitalopram, venlafaxine and fluoxetine, changes are considered negligible. For sertraline, there was a tendency toward increased dose-adjusted concentrations in pregnancy. Available evidence suffers from major limitations and factors affecting pharmacokinetics have been insufficiently addressed. Further research is required to promote knowledge on pregnancy effects on antidepressant pharmacokinetics.
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms affect the exposure, efficacy and safety of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with some drugs being affected by CYP2D6 only (e.g., nortriptyline and desipramine) and others by both polymorphic enzymes (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine). Evidence is presented for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype-directed dosing of TCAs. This document is an update to the 2012 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Tricyclic Antidepressants.
For the first time the facts from the history of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) are systematized in Russian psychiatric literature. The authors describe the history of first TCA agents, analyze the history of TCA group development based on the increase of new agents, present the history of original TCA creation in the USSR and the Eastern block countries, systemize the history of TCA classification development and review the studies on TCA neurochemical activity. An impact of TCA history on formulation of hypotheses of the pathogenesis of depression and some forms of neuroses is demonstrated. It is shown that the history of TCA creation urged the development of new groups of antidepressants.
