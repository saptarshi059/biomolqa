Ibuprofen was introduced in England in 1967 and in the United States in 1974 as an anti-inflammatory drug in humans. It has weak but definite anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of aspirin, milligram for milligram, but with considerably less adverse effect on the stomach. Ibuprofen is chemically related to fenoprofen and naproxen, but lack of effect for any one in this chemical class of propionic-acid derivatives does not necessarily mean lack of effect for any other in an individual patient. The drug has analgesic properties, probably related to its anti-inflammatory effect. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has no effect on the adrenopituitary axis, making it a nonsteroidal agent. Ibuprofen has been shown to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and is probably effective in ankylosing spondylitis, gout, and Bartter's syndrome.
Herein, we review the recent progress in the synthesis of representative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ibuprofen and naproxen. Although these drugs were discovered over 50 years ago, novel practical and asymmetric approaches are still being developed for their synthesis. In addition, this endeavor has enabled access to more potent and selective derivatives from the key frameworks of ibuprofen and naproxen. The development of a synthetic route to ibuprofen and naproxen over the last 10 years is summarized, including developing methodologies, finding novel synthetic routes, and applying continuous-flow chemistry.
The anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is considered to be an emerging contaminant because of its presence in different environments (from water bodies to soils) at concentrations with adverse effects on aquatic organisms due to cytotoxic and genotoxic damage, high oxidative cell stress, and detrimental effects on growth, reproduction, and behavior. Because of its high human consumption rate and low environmental degradation rate, ibuprofen represents an emerging environmental problem. Ibuprofen enters the environment from different sources and accumulates in natural environmental matrices. The problem of drugs, particularly ibuprofen, as contaminants is complicated because few strategies consider them or apply successful technologies to remove them in a controlled and efficient manner. In several countries, ibuprofen's entry into the environment is an unattended contamination problem. It is a concern for our environmental health system that requires more attention. Due to its physicochemical characteristics, ibuprofen degradation is difficult in the environment or by microorganisms. There are experimental studies that are currently focused on the problem of drugs as potential environmental contaminants. However, these studies are insufficient to address this ecological issue worldwide. This review focuses on deepening and updating the information concerning ibuprofen as a potential emerging environmental contaminant and the potential for using bacteria for its biodegradation as an alternative technology.
OBJECTIVE: A narrative review of randomized, blinded, controlled studies assessing the antipyretic effect of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen or combined or alternating treatment in children was conducted. METHODS: Searches of the PubMed and Embase literature databases were conducted to identify relevant articles. Selected articles were limited to studies published in English that investigated OTC oral tablet and syrup formulations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen; there were no publication date limits. Open-label studies, nonrandomized studies, and those evaluating intravenous or suppository formulations of acetaminophen or ibuprofen were excluded. Variations in designs, endpoints, methods, and patient populations precluded our ability to conduct a formal systematic review. RESULTS: At physician-directed dosing (acetaminophen 15 mg/kg vs ibuprofen 10 mg/kg), no significant differences in antipyretic effects from 0‒6 h and between 0‒6, ‒12, ‒24, or ‒48 h, with single or multiple-doses, respectively, were observed. Tolerability profiles at physician dosing were similar. In 14 over-the-counter dose comparisons (acetaminophen, 10-15 mg/kg; ibuprofen, 2.5-10 mg/kg), antipyresis favored ibuprofen in 6, was similar between groups in 7, and favored acetaminophen (15 mg/kg vs ibuprofen 5 mg/kg) in 1 comparison. Both medications were well tolerated. Efficacy favored combination over individual components in 3 of 4 studies; alternating use results were mixed. All combination or alternating treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Antipyretic effects of ibuprofen and acetaminophen are similar at physician-directed doses; ibuprofen may be modestly superior at over-the-counter doses.
Ibuprofen is a chiral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the 2 arylpropionic acid (2-APA) class. A common structural feature of 2-APANSAIDs is a sp3-hybridised tetrahedral chiral carbon atom within the propionic acid side chain moiety with the S-(+)-enantiomer possessing most of the beneficial anti-inflammatory activity. Ibuprofen demonstrates marked stereoselectivity in its pharmacokinetics. Substantial unidirectional inversion of the R-(-) to the S-(+) enantiomer occurs and thus, data generated using nonstereospecific assays may not be extrapolated to explain the disposition of the individual enantiomers. The absorption of ibuprofen is rapid and complete when given orally. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ibuprofen is dose-dependent. Ibuprofen binds extensively, in a concentration-dependent manner, to plasma albumin. At doses greater than 600mg there is an increase in the unbound fraction of the drug, leading to an increased clearance of ibuprofen and a reduced AUC of the total drug. Substantial concentrations of ibuprofen are attained in synovial fluid, which is a proposed site of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Ibuprofen is eliminated following biotransformation to glucuronide conjugate metabolites that are excreted in urine, with little of the drug being eliminated unchanged. The excretion of conjugates may be tied to renal function and the accumulation of conjugates occurs in end-stage renal disease. Hepatic disease and cystic fibrosis can alter the disposition kinetics of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is not excreted in substantial concentrations into breast milk. Significant drug interactions have been demonstrated for aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), cholestyramine and methotrexate. A relationship between ibuprofen plasma concentrations and analgesic and antipyretic effects has been elucidated.
