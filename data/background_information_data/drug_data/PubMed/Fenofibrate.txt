BACKGROUND: Findings from cardiovascular outcome trials suggest that fenofibrate therapy may reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: We recruited and followed adults with nonreferable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy using the national Diabetic Eye Screening (DES) program in Scotland. We randomly assigned participants to receive 145-mg fenofibrate tablets or placebo (taken daily or, in those with impaired renal function, on alternate days). The primary outcome was a composite of developing referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy (based on Scotland's DES grading scheme) or treatment (intravitreal injection, retinal laser, vitrectomy) for retinopathy or maculopathy. RESULTS: A total of 1151 participants were randomly assigned to treatment. During a median of 4.0 years, progression to referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy, or treatment thereof, occurred in 131 (22.7%) of 576 participants in the fenofibrate group and 168 (29.2%) of 575 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.91; P=0.006). In the fenofibrate group compared with the placebo group, the frequencies for any progression of retinopathy or maculopathy were 185 (32.1%) vs. 231 (40.2%); hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.90 and for the development of macular edema were 22 (3.8%) vs. 43 (7.5%); hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.84. Seventeen (3.0%) participants assigned fenofibrate and 28 (4.9%) assigned placebo were given treatment for retinopathy (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.06). There was no effect on visual function, quality of life, or visual acuity. Trial-averaged estimated glomerular filtration rate was 7.9 (95% CI, 6.8 to 9.1) ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower in participants in the fenofibrate group compared with the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 208 (36.1%) participants allocated fenofibrate and 204 (35.5%) participants allocated placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Fenofibrate reduced progression of diabetic retinopathy compared with placebo among participants with early retinal changes.

We have developed a co-assembled nanosystem based on fenofibrate and ketoprofen by tactfully utilizing their simultaneous benzophenone interaction, which greatly enhances the bioavailability of fenofibrate and plays a role in the dual-targeted treatment of NAFLD by reducing hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses.
IMPORTANCE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) may progress from nonproliferative DR (NPDR) to vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Studies have investigated fenofibrate use as a protective measure with conflicting results, and fenofibrate is not typically considered by ophthalmologists in the management of DR currently. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between fenofibrate use and the progression from NPDR to VTDR, proliferative DR (PDR), or diabetic macular edema (DME). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study used medical claims data from a large US insurer. Cohorts were created from all patients with NPDR 18 years or older who had laboratory values from January 1, 2002, to June 30, 2019. Exclusion criteria consisted of any previous diagnosis of PDR, DME, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, or treatment used in the care of VTDR. Patients were also excluded if they had a diagnosis of VTDR within 2 years of insurance plan entry, regardless of when NPDR was first noted in the plan. EXPOSURES: Fenofibrate use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were a new diagnosis of VTDR (a composite outcome of either PDR or DME) or DME and PDR individually. A time-updating model for all covariates was used in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression to determine hazards of progressing to an outcome. Additional covariates included NPDR severity scale, systemic illnesses, demographics, kidney function (based on estimated glomerular filtration rate level), hemoglobin A1c, hemoglobin, and insulin use. RESULTS: A total of 5835 fenofibrate users with NPDR at baseline (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [10.4] years; 3564 [61.1%] male; 3024 [51.8%] White) and 144 417 fenofibrate nonusers (mean [SD] age, 65.7 [12.3] years; 73 587 [51.0%] male; 67 023 [46.4%] White) were included for analysis. Of these, 27 325 (18.2%) progressed to VTDR, 4086 (2.71%) progressed to PDR, and 22 750 (15.1%) progressed to DME. After controlling for all covariates, Cox model results showed fenofibrates to be associated with a decreased risk of VTDR (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87-0.98]; P = .01) and PDR (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.64-0.90]; P = .001) but not DME (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.90-1.03]; P = .27). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, fenofibrate use was associated with a decreased risk of PDR and VTDR but not DME alone. These findings support the rationale for additional clinical trials to determine if these associations may be representative of a causal relationship between fenofibrate use and reduced risk of PDR or VTDR.
BACKGROUND: Fenofibrate (FF) has been suggested as a second-line therapy for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). But its long-term effect is unclear. METHODS: From a retrospective cohort (N.=838), we enrolled 106 UDCA-refractory PBC patients, among them 62 received UDCA monotherapy (UDCA group) and 44 received FF combined with UDCA (UDCA+FF group). Changes of liver biochemistries and prognosis after treatment were determined. In addition, sequential liver biopsies were used to assess the effect of FF on histological parameters. RESULTS: We found adding FF could significantly reduce serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but for patients with pretreatment ALP>/=1.67 upper limit of normal (ULN), the significant decline of serum ALP was only observed in the UDCA+FF group after 1 year of therapy. The mean GLOBE Score and the liver transplant-free survival predicted by GLOBE Score were both improved significantly in patients receiving UDCA+FF after 1 year of therapy. The liver-related death or liver transplant calculated using UK-PBC risk score was significantly reduced in patients receiving UDCA+FF after 1 year of therapy. Although there was no marked difference in the final histological analysis after 3 years of therapy, patients receiving UDCA+FF had improvements or stabilization in fibrosis (85.7%), and bile duct loss (78.6%) were more than that of patients receiving UDCA (70.6% and 76.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adding FF improves GLOBE and UK-PBC scores and is also associated with the improvements or stabilization of disease features, including fibrosis and ductular injury.
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In diabetes haptoglobin (Hp) 2 vs Hp 1 allelic product is associated with cardiac and renal complications. Few studies report both Hp phenotype and Hp levels. In a Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial substudy we evaluated the Hp phenotype, Hp levels, and fenofibrate effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 480 adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) the Hp phenotype was assessed and the Hp level quantified (both using ELISAs assays) in plasma from baseline, after 6 weeks of fenofibrate, and (in n = 200) at 2 years post-randomization to fenofibrate or placebo. RESULTS: The Hp phenotypes 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2 frequencies were 15%, 49%, and 36%, respectively. Baseline Hp levels differed by phenotype (P < 0.0001) and decreased (median 21%) after 6 weeks fenofibrate in all phenotypes (adjusted mean (95% CI): -0.27 (-0.32, -0.23) mg/mL in Hp 1-1, -0.29 (-0.31, -0.27) mg/mL in Hp 2-1 and -0.05 (-0.07, -0.02) mg/mL in Hp 2-2 (P = 0.005 and P = 0.055 vs Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-1, respectively)). At 2 years post-randomization the Hp levels in the placebo group had returned to baseline, whilst the fenofibrate-group levels remained similar to the 6 week levels. CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, Hp levels differ by Hp phenotype and are decreased by fenofibrate in all phenotypes, but the effect is diminished in Hp 2-2.
AIMS: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) alters the anatomical structure of the gastrointestinal tract, which can result in alterations in drug disposition. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the oral disposition of two compounds belonging to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class II - fenofibrate (bile salt-dependent solubility) and posaconazole (gastric pH-dependent dissolution) - before and after RYGB in the same individuals. METHODS: A single-dose pharmacokinetic study with two model compounds - namely, 67 mg fenofibrate (Lipanthyl(R)) and 400 mg posaconazole (Noxafil(R)) - was performed in 12 volunteers pre- and post-RYGB. After oral administration, blood samples were collected at different time points up to 48 h after administration. Plasma concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in order to calculate the area under the concentration-time curve up to 48 h (AUC(0-48 h) ), the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and the time to reach peak concentration (T(max) ). RESULTS: After administration of fenofibrate, no relevant differences in AUC(0-48 h) , C(max) and T(max) between the pre- and postoperative setting were observed. The geometric mean of the ratio of AUC(0-48 h) post/pre-RYGB for fenofibrate was 1.10 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 1.40; P = 0.40]. For posaconazole, an important decrease in AUC(0-48 h) and C(max) following RYGB was shown; the geometric mean of the AUC(0-48 h) post/pre-RYGB ratio was 0.68 (95% CI 0.48, 0.96; P = 0.03) and the geometric mean of the C(max) pre/post-RYGB ratio was 0.60 (95% CI 0.39, 0.94; P = 0.03). The decreased exposure of posaconazole could be explained by the increased gastric pH and accelerated gastric emptying of fluids post-RYGB. No difference for T(max) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The disposition of fenofibrate was not altered after RYGB, whereas the oral disposition of posaconazole was significantly decreased following RYGB.
INTRODUCTION: Fenofibrate is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), that possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-thrombotic properties. Fenofibrate is effective against a variety of viral infections and different inflammatory disorders. Therefore, the aim of critical review was to overview the potential role of fenofibrate in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and related complications. RESULTS: By destabilizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and preventing it from binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, fenofibrate can reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells Fenofibrate also suppresses inflammatory signaling pathways, which decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection-related inflammatory alterations. In conclusion, fenofibrate anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic capabilities may help to minimize the inflammatory and thrombotic consequences associated with SARSCoV-2 infection. Through attenuating the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, fenofibrate can directly reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: As a result, fenofibrate could be a potential treatment approach for COVID-19 control.
Fenofibrate is a lipid-regulating drug which is structurally related to other fibric acid derivatives, such as clofibrate. At the recommended dosage of 200 to 400 mg daily, it produces substantial reductions in plasma triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridaemic patients and in plasma total cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels are generally increased in patients with low pretreatment values. Fenofibrate appears to be equally effective in diabetic patients with hyperlipoproteinaemia without adversely affecting glycaemic control. The influence of fenofibrate on the plasma lipid profile is sustained during long term (2 to 7 years) treatment. Comparative studies conducted to date have involved only small groups of patients--in overall terms fenofibrate was at least as effective as other fibrates, but larger comparative studies are needed before valid conclusions on its relative efficacy compared with nonfibrate lipid-lowering drugs can be drawn. The influence of fenofibrate on morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease has not been studied. Clinical adverse reactions to fenofibrate have mainly consisted of gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and muscle cramps. Transient elevations in transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels commonly occur. Isolated cases of hepatitis with substantially elevated transaminase levels have been reported. Fenofibrate induces hepatomegaly, peroxisome proliferation and hepatic carcinomas in rodents, but this type of hepatotoxicity has not been observed in humans. The biliary lithogenic index is increased by fenofibrate, but this has not been shown to have increased the incidence of gallstones in treated patients. Thus, fenofibrate offers an effective and well tolerated alternative to clofibrate or other fibric acid derivatives, but its relative efficacy and tolerability compared with other types of lipid-lowering drugs, and its effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, remain to be clarified.
BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of fenofibrate add-on to statin treatment on all-cause death and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population who had high triglyceride (TG). METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study using data from the Korea National Health Information Database for 2010 to 2017. Among participants who had already used statins and had TG >/= 150 mg/dL, 277,836 fenofibrate users were identified and compared with 277,836 fenofibrate non-users with 1:1 age- and sex-adjusted matching. RESULTS: During a mean 4.13-year follow-up, the incidences per 1000 person years of all-cause death and CVD were lower in fenofibrate users than in fenofibrate non-users (4.812 vs. 5.354 for all-cause death, P < 0.0001; 6.283 vs. 6.420 for CVD, P < 0.0001). The hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause death and CVD among fenofibrate users were 0.826 (95 % CI 0.795-0.858) and 0.929 (95 % CI 0.898-0.962), respectively. In addition, 73.35 % of participants did not have diabetes and fenofibrate showed consistently beneficial effects on all-cause death or CVD in patients with and without diabetes. Use of fenofibrate for more than one year was associated with low risk for both all-cause death (HR 0.618) and CVD (HR 0.853), but use of fenofibrate for less than one year was not. CONCLUSIONS: Fenofibrate as an add-on to statin treatment was associated with low risk of all-cause death and CVD in general population who had high TG. These beneficial effects were consistent regardless of the presence of diabetes, but at least one year of fenofibrate use was needed.
BACKGROUND: Although patients with advanced liver disease have been included in studies evaluating fibrates for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), the frequency of biochemical responses and adverse effects for this group of patients was not reported separately and comprehensively. AIMS: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional fenofibrate therapy in patients with advanced and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)-refractory PBC. METHODS: Patients were analyzed retrospectively to determine the clinical therapeutic effects of UDCA with additional fenofibrate therapy versus continued UDCA monotherapy. The liver transplantation (LT)-free survival and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) normalization rates were estimated using Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier plots with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were included: 54 received UDCA alone and 64 received UDCA in combination with fenofibrate therapy. In the fenofibrate and UDCA groups, 37% and 11% of patients with advanced and UDCA-refractory PBC, respectively, achieved ALP normalization (P=0.001). Additional fenofibrate therapy improved both LT-free survival and ALP normalization rate after IPTW (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-0.75, P=0.015; and HR: 11.66, 95% CI: 5.02-27.06, P=0.001, respectively). These effects were supported by parallel changes in the rates of liver decompensation and histologic progression, and the United Kingdom (UK)-PBC and Globe risk scores. During the follow-up period, serum levels of ALP and aminotransferase decreased significantly, while total bilirubin, albumin, platelet, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate remained stable in fenofibrate-treated participants. No fenofibrate-related significant adverse events were observed in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Additional fenofibrate therapy significantly improved LT-free survival and ALP normalization in patients with advanced and UDCA-refractory PBC. Furthermore, adding-on fenofibrate therapy appeared to be safe and well tolerated in this population.
Dyslipidemia is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors, but beyond statin treatment-which represents the cornerstone of therapy-a relevant practical uncertainty regards the use of fibrate derivatives. In the lack of successful results from the main cardiovascular trials, guidelines recommend the use of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists in selected cases, i.e. patients with true atherogenic dyslipidemia. However, recent observations indicate that fenofibrate treatment may provide a reliable complementary support against residual cardiovascular risk. We therefore summarize current evidence on fenofibrate, seeking to provide an updated interpretation of recent studies in the field.
Simvastatin and fenofibrate are frequently co-prescribed at staggered intervals for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Since a drug-drug interaction has been reported when the two drugs are given simultaneously, it is of clinical interest to know whether the interaction differs between simultaneous and staggered combinations. A study, assessing the impact of both combinations on the interaction, was conducted with 7-day treatment regimens using simvastatin 40 mg and fenofibrate 145 mg: (A) simvastatin only (evening), (B) simvastatin and fenofibrate (both in evening), and (C) simvastatin (evening) and fenofibrate (morning). Eighty-five healthy subjects received the respective treatments in a randomized, 3-way cross-over study. The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and the active metabolite simvastatin acid were determined. There was a limited reduction in the AUC0-24h of simvastatin acid of 21 and 29% for simultaneous and staggered combination, respectively. The geometric mean AUC0-24h ratio of simvastatin acid for the two combined dosing regimens (B/C) and 90% confidence interval were 111% (102-121). The interaction apparently had no impact on lipid markers. The findings imply that the observed pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely clinically relevant, and support the combined use of simvastatin and fenofibrate not only given at staggered interval but also given simultaneously.
Phototherapy is the standard treatment for neonatal jaundice. We aimed to review the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate as an adjunct therapy. Twelve databases were searched and a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Mean change (MC), mean difference (MD), and risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the evidence's certainty. Nine randomized trials were included. The MC of total serum bilirubin (mg/dL) was significant at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h with respective MC (95% CI) values of -0.46 (-0.61, -0.310), -1.10 (-1.68, -0.52), -2.06 (-2.20, -1.91), -2.15 (-2.74, -1.56), and -1.13 (-1.71, -0.55). The FEN + PT group had a shorter duration of phototherapy (MD: -14.36 h; 95% CI: -23.67, -5.06) and a shorter hospital stay (MD: -1.40 days; 95% CI: -2.14, -0.66). There was no significant difference in the risk of complications (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.46) or the need for exchange transfusion (RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.12, 2.81). The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. In conclusion, fenofibrate might be a safe adjunct to neonatal phototherapy. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed for the confirmation of these results.
