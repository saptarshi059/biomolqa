Since 1969, 79 cases of fungal maxillary sinusitis have been diagnosed. Forty-nine were due to Aspergillus fumigatus. There were no underlying diseases which depressed cellular immunity and no patient was receiving immunosuppressive drugs or corticosteroids. Most patients had received antibacterial therapy before the appearance of FMS. Treatment was by surgery, nystatin and econazole.
Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are tumors that develop in more than 99% of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). They develop in the dermis and can number in the thousands. cNFs can be itchy and painful and negatively impact self-esteem. There is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for their treatment. Here, we screen a library of FDA-approved drugs using a cNF cell model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generated from an NF1 patient. We engineer an NF1 mutation in the second allele to mimic loss of heterozygosity, differentiate the NF1(+/-) and NF1(-/-) hiPSCs into Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), and use them to screen a drug library to assess for inhibition of NF1(-/-) but not NF1(+/-) cell proliferation. We identify econazole nitrate as being effective against NF1(-/-) hiPSC-SCPs. Econazole cream selectively induces apoptosis in Nf1(-/-) murine nerve root neurosphere cells and human cNF xenografts. This study supports further testing of econazole for cNF treatment.
INTRODUCTION: Around 15% to 25% of people are likely to have athlete's foot at any one time. The infection can spread to other parts of the body and to other people. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical treatments for athlete's foot? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: improved foot hygiene, including socks and hosiery; topical allylamines (naftifine and terbinafine); topical azoles (bifonazole, clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, and tioconazole); and topical ciclopirox olamine.
Blastomycosis is an uncommon, sometimes self-healing, sometimes fatal, infectious disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. Although amphotericin B is still considered the drug of choice, ketoconazole and several other imidazole drugs--miconazole, itraconazole, econazole--have shown promise in the treatment of blastomycosis.
This study explored the effect of deltamethrin, a pesticide, on intracellular free Ca(2)(+) concentration ([Ca(2)(+)]i) in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Deltamethrin at concentrations between 5 muM and 20 muM evoked [Ca(2)(+)]i rises in a concentration-dependent manner. This Ca(2)(+) signal was inhibited by 22% by removal of extracellular Ca(2)(+). Nifedipine, econazole, and SKF96365 also inhibited the Ca(2)(+) signal. Treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2)(+) pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) in Ca(2)(+)-free medium nearly abolished deltamethrin-induced [Ca(2)(+)]i rises. Treatment with deltamethrin also inhibited most of BHQ-induced [Ca(2)(+)]i rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 failed to alter deltamethrin-evoked [Ca(2)(+)]i rises. Deltamethrin killed cells at concentrations of 20-100 muM in a concentration-dependent fashion. Chelation of cytosolic Ca(2)(+) with 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM) did not prevent deltamethrin's cytotoxicity. Together, in PC3 human prostate cancer cells, deltamethrin induced [Ca(2)(+)]i rises that involved Ca(2)(+) entry through store-operated Ca(2)(+) channels and PLC-independent Ca(2)(+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Deltamethrin induced cytotoxicity in a Ca(2)(+)-independent manner.
