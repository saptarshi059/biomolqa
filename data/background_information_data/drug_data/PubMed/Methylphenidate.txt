Psychostimulants, including amphetamines and methylphenidate, are first-line pharmacotherapies for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review aims to educate physicians regarding differences in pharmacology and mechanisms of action between amphetamine and methylphenidate, thus enhancing physician understanding of psychostimulants and their use in managing individuals with ADHD who may have comorbid psychiatric conditions. A systematic literature review of PubMed was conducted in April 2017, focusing on cellular- and brain system-level effects of amphetamine and methylphenidate. The primary pharmacologic effect of both amphetamine and methylphenidate is to increase central dopamine and norepinephrine activity, which impacts executive and attentional function. Amphetamine actions include dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibition, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) inhibition, and monoamine oxidase activity inhibition. Methylphenidate actions include dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibition, agonist activity at the serotonin type 1A receptor, and redistribution of the VMAT-2. There is also evidence for interactions with glutamate and opioid systems. Clinical implications of these actions in individuals with ADHD with comorbid depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, and sleep disturbances are discussed.
Methylphenidate is prescribed for over 90% of children in the US diagnosed as having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although ADHD has been widely studied, the use of methylphenidate in ADHD still poses a number of unresolved questions, including its pharmacodynamic characteristics (drug concentration-effect relationship) and the effect of long term treatment on the patient's psychopathology later in life. The objective of this review is to provide an analysis of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties and therapeutic effectiveness of methylphenidate that may help to answer some of these questions. Methylphenidate has 2 chiral centres, but the drug used in therapy comprises only the threo pair of enantiomers. d-threo-Methylphenidate is more potent than the l-enantiomer. Methylphenidate is administered as a racemic mixture that undergoes stereoselective clearance. Methylphenidate is a short-acting stimulant with a duration of action of 1 to 4 hours and a pharmacokinetic half-life of 2 to 3 hours. Maximum drug concentration after oral administration occurs at about 2 hours. Methylphenidate is absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract and easily passes to the brain. Methylphenidate is efficacious for short term treatment for children with ADHD. Its mechanism of action is not understood, but may be associated with its influence on multiple neurotransmitters, especially the release and reuptake of dopamine in the striatum. There is marked individual variability in the dose-response relationship for methylphenidate, and therefore dosage must be titrated for optimal effect and avoidance of toxicity in each child. It is unclear whether this variability is predominantly pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic. If variable stereoselective metabolism occurs clinically, therapeutic drug monitoring of methylphenidate will require the application of chiral assay methods for the analysis of the active component, d-threo-methylphenidate. It is difficult to predict which children will have a favourable response to methylphenidate. Nonetheless, several studies have been published linking the severity of ADHD in children with improved clinical response to methylphenidate. The use of individual single-blind medication trials may be a practical solution to this problem. Additionally, the targeted condition warrants careful consideration, since different conditions (e.g. misbehaviour or poor academic performance) may require different regimens. Further studies of the relationship between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of methylphenidate are required to allow the development of optimal dosage regimens.
INTRODUCTION: Methylphenidate remains a first-line medication for treating ADHD in children and adults. However, its behavioral pharmacological similarities to methamphetamine and cocaine have historically created concern for its potential as a drug of abuse. In September 2019, the FDA published a docket requesting comments for the development of abuse deterrent formulations for CNS stimulants, emphasizing the abuse of methylphenidate as a public health concern. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a narrative review of research on the clinical pharmacology, therapeutic efficacy, and abuse potential of methylphenidate. EXPERT OPINION: Several studies indicate that methylphenidate has at least some abuse potential. Methylphenidate, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine overlap in their subjective, reinforcing, and discriminative stimulus effects. Regardless, methylphenidate remains an efficacious treatment for ADHD in children and adults when properly adhered to, especially when paired with non-pharmacological treatments. The development of abuse deterrent formulations of methylphenidate is warranted.
As the first drug to see widespread use for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), methylphenidate was the forerunner and catalyst to the modern era of rapidly increasing diagnosis, treatment, and medication development for this condition. During its often controversial history, it has variously elucidated the importance of dopamine signaling in memory and attention, provoked concerns about pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement, driven innovation in controlled-release technologies and enantiospecific therapeutics, and stimulated debate about the impact of pharmaceutical sales techniques on the practice of medicine. In this Review, we will illustrate the history and importance of methylphenidate to ADHD treatment and neuroscience in general, as well as provide key information about its synthesis, structure-activity relationship, pharmacological activity, metabolism, manufacturing, FDA-approved indications, and adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. Although enuresis is a very common disorder in child diagnosed with ADHD, it may also develop because of methylphenidate. METHODS: Authors report here on a child case of ADHD that developed a probable enuresis related to methylphenidate. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that methylphenidate used in ADHD causes dose-dependent enuresis.
