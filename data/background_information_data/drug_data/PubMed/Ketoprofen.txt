Drug-induced photosensitivity reactions are significant adverse effects. Ketoprofen is one of the most common drugs that can cause skin rash in sun-exposed areas. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ketoprofen, are often used for a variety of symptoms, including pain and fever. An understanding of the presentation and clinical course of ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity is necessary to correctly diagnose and manage this condition. Ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity reactions usually present as photoallergic dermatitis, which is a cell-mediated immune process. The benzophenone moiety in ketoprofen plays a major role in ketoprofen's ability to act as a photosensitizer. Several agents, such as fenofibrate and octocrylene have been found to be associated with aggravation of ketoprofen-induced photoallergic dermatitis or cross-photosensitization, and these reactions result from structural similarities with ketoprofen. Treatment of ketoprofen-induced photoallergic dermatitis includes discontinuation of ketoprofen, topical or systemic corticosteroids and avoidance of sun exposure and agents known to exacerbate dermatitis. In conclusion, photoallergic dermatitis is a significant adverse effect of ketoprofen. Some agents known to worsen dermatitis may be found in sun protection products (notably, octocrylene in sunscreen). Educating the patient to avoid these products is critical to treatment. Since NSAIDs, such as ketoprofen, are used commonly for a variety of illnesses, drug-induced photoallergic dermatitis should be high on the differential in individuals using these medications who present with acute onset of a rash in sun-exposed areas.
Topical ketoprofen (KP) is widely used because of its anti-inflammatory effect. Parallel with its popular usage, the number of reported cases of ketoprofen-induced photoallergic contact dermatitis has increased. A review of the literature was made to evaluate the spectrum of cross sensitization in patients with ketoprofen-induced photoallergic contact dermatitis using ketoprofen and other structurally similar chemicals and sunscreens, fragrance components, as well as the presence of prolonged photosensitivity related to it. Furthermore, the distinction between true cross-reactivity and concomitant sensitization may be difficult. Therefore, further investigations are needed to gain a more complete understanding of this important topic. This article also reviews some patents related to alternative treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and/or treatment of allergic reactions due to NSAIDs use.
Dear Editor, Photoallergic reactions are classic T-cell-mediated or delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions of the skin in response to a photoallergen (or a cross-reacting chemical) to which a subject was sensitized in the past (1). The immune system recognizes the changes caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation; it produces antibodies and causes inflammation of the skin in the exposed areas (2). Common photoallergic drugs and ingredients are included in some sunscreens, aftershave lotions, antimicrobials (especially sulfonamides), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, anticonvulsants, chemotherapy drugs, fragrances, and other hygiene products (1,3,4). A 64-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Dermatology and Venereology with erythema and underlining edema on her left foot (Figure 1). A few weeks earlier, the patient had had a fracture of the metatarsal bones and since then she had been taking NSAIDs systemically every day to suppress pain. Five days before being admitted to our Department, the patient started applying 2.5% ketoprofen gel to her left foot twice daily and was frequently exposed to the sun. For the last twenty years, the patient had been struggling with chronic back pain and was frequently taking different NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc.). The patient also suffered from essential hypertension and was regularly taking ramipril. She was advised to discontinue ketoprofen application, avoid sunlight, and apply betamethasone cream twice daily for 7 days, which lead to complete resolution of the skin lesions in a few weeks. Two months later, we performed patch and photopatch tests to baseline series and topical ketoprofen. Only the irradiated side of the body where ketoprofen-containing gel was applied showed positive reaction to ketoprofen. Photoallergic reactions manifest as eczematous, pruritic lesions, which may spread to involve other areas of the skin that were not previously exposed to the sun (4). Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug composed of a benzoylphenyl propionic acid that is commonly used both topically and systemically for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases because of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and low toxicity, but it is one of the most frequent photoallergens (1,5,6). Ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity reactions usually present as photoallergic dermatitis characterized as acute dermatitis with edema, erythema, papulovesicles, blisters, or erythema exsudativum multiforme-like lesions at the application site 1 week to 1 month after the initiation of use (7). Depending on the frequency and intensity of sun exposure, ketoprofen photodermatitis may continue or reoccur up to 1 to 14 years after discontinuing the medication (6,8). Moreover, ketoprofen contaminates clothing, shoes, and bandages, and some cases of photoallergy relapses have been reported that were induced by ketoprofen-contaminated objects after they were used again in the presence of UV radiation (5,6). Due to their similar biochemical structure, patients with ketoprofen photoallergy should avoid using some drugs such as some NSAIDs (suprofen, tiaprofenic acid), antilipidemic agent (fenofibrate) and sunscreens based on benzophenones (6,9). Physicians and pharmacists should advise patients of the potential risks when topical NSAIDs are applied on the photoexposed skin.
Although oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in the treatment of a variety of acute and chronic pain conditions, their use may be associated with serious systemic adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal disorders. In order to minimise the incidence of systemic events related to such agents, topical NSAIDs have been developed. Topical NSAIDs, applied as gels, creams or sprays, penetrate the skin, subcutaneous fatty tissue and muscle in amounts that are sufficient to exert a therapeutic effect on peripheral and central mechanisms in the absence of high plasma concentrations. Data indicate that topical NSAIDs are effective at relieving pain in a number of acute and chronic pain indications. This review article discusses the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and tolerability of a new formulation of ketoprofen available as a topical patch. The topical patch containing ketoprofen 100mg as the active principle has been developed using a novel delivery system that dispenses therapeutic doses of the drug directly to the site of injury. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that although plasma levels of ketoprofen are higher when the drug is administered as a patch versus a gel, the total systemic bioavailability of ketoprofen 100 mg administered via a patch is no more than 10% of that reported for ketoprofen 100 mg administered orally. Because the patch facilitates ketoprofen delivery over a 24-hour period, the drug remains continually present in the tissue subjacent to the site of application. High tissue but low plasma ketoprofen concentrations mean that while tissue concentrations are high enough to exert a therapeutic effect, plasma concentrations remain low enough to not result in systemic adverse events caused by elevated serum NSAID levels. Phase III clinical trials in patients with non-articular rheumatism and traumatic painful soft tissue injuries showed that the topical ketoprofen patch was significantly more effective than placebo at reducing pain during daily activities and spontaneous pain after 7 days' treatment. Moreover, the topical ketoprofen patch was well tolerated; adverse events were primarily cutaneous in nature and occurred in a similar number of ketoprofen and placebo recipients suggesting that these events were related to the patch itself rather than the active ingredient. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was low (<8% of all patients), and occurred in a similar proportion of patients receiving ketoprofen and placebo. Thus, the topical ketoprofen patch appears to be a simple, effective and safe therapeutic option for the treatment of local painful inflammation.
Ketoprofen has, over the last few years, undergone extensive clinical trials in many centres throughout the world and these are reviewed. Adequately controlled trials have established its undoubted clinical efficacy as an antirheumatic agent in all the major rheumatic diseases, and have demonstrated therapeutic potency, comparable with other established non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs.
