Drug-induced hallucinations are not uncommon, and may be misdiagnosed as psychiatric illness leading to unnecessary treatment with antipsychotics. If a temporal association of use of a drug having the potential to cause hallucinations is present, mere withdrawal of the drug causes complete improvement in the symptoms. There are reports of various untoward central nervous system adverse events following administration of fluoroquinolones, including delirium, hallucinations and psychosis, even after a single dose. We describe a 5-year-old girl who suffered visual hallucinations following ofloxacin use.
We describe a patient with hypersensitivity vasculitis due to ofloxacin therapy; the vasculitis was associated with elevated transaminase and IgA levels. Cyclophosphamide and intravenous pulse prednisolone resulted in clinical improvement.
To assess the safety of topical agents in the middle ear, animal studies were reviewed. Compared with aminoglycoside-containing preparations, which caused significant loss of hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea, ofloxacin caused no loss of hair cells, even at concentrations higher than used clinically. Moreover auditory brainstem testing revealed no change in auditory thresholds in the ofloxacin-treated animals, whereas neomycin-treated animals showed substantial threshold shifts. In human studies, use of topical ofloxacin 0.3% was not associated with any change in hearing. Topical ofloxacin has no demonstrable adverse effects on middle ear or cochlear function.
Ofloxacin is a new fluorinated quinolone antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and -negative bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, ofloxacin has significant activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and this may give rise to new indications for the class of quinolone antibiotics. Clinical trials to date have demonstrated the efficacy of ofloxacin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. Adverse effects to ofloxacin are usually mild and include gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and hypersensitivity reactions. Significant drug interactions with ofloxacin have not been reported.
Ofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone with a spectrum of activity similar to other fluoroquinolones with activity which includes Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Legionella pneumophila. Through its additional mechanisms of action, ofloxacin may be less susceptible to the development of resistance from Staphylococcus aureus commonly seen with currently available fluoroquinolones. The impact of these findings cannot be evaluated without further clinical experience. The pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin are characterised by almost complete bioavailability (95 to 100%), peak serum concentrations in the range of 2 to 3 mg/L after a 400mg oral dose and an average half-life of 5 to 8h. In comparison with other available quinolones, elimination is more highly dependent on renal clearance, which may lead to more frequent dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Ofloxacin appears less likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs (e.g. theophylline) which commonly interact with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin. The properties of ofloxacin make it a therapeutic alternative to currently available fluoroquinolones.
