Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important component of a standard combination therapy against tuberculosis. However, PZA is hepatotoxic, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Biotransformation of PZA in the liver was primarily suggested behind its hepatoxicity. This review summarizes the knowledge of the key enzymes involved in PZA metabolism and discusses their contributions to PZA hepatotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review outlines the current understanding of PZA metabolism and hepatotoxicity. This work also highlights the gaps in this field, which can be used to guide the future studies on PZA-induced liver injury.
Inclusion of pyrazinamide (PZA) in the tuberculosis (TB) drug regimen during the 1970s enabled a reduction in treatment duration from 12 to 6 months. PZA has this remarkable effect in patients despite displaying poor potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in vitro. The pharmacological basis for the in vivo sterilizing activity of the drug has remained obscure and its bacterial target controversial. Recently it was shown that PZA penetrates necrotic caseous TB lung lesions and kills nongrowing, drug-tolerant bacilli. Furthermore, it was uncovered that PZA inhibits bacterial Coenzyme A biosynthesis. It may block this pathway by triggering degradation of its target, aspartate decarboxylase. The elucidation of the pharmacological and molecular mechanisms of PZA provides the basis for the rational discovery of the next-generation PZA with improved in vitro potency while maintaining attractive pharmacological properties.
Pretomanid, an oral nitroimidazooxazine antimycobacterial agent administered as part of the BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid) and BPaMZ (bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide) regimens, has been developed by the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) under license from Novartis, for the treatment for tuberculosis (TB). TB Alliance has licensed Mylan to manufacture and commercialize pretomanid for use as part of the BPaMZ and BPaL regimens. The license is non-exclusive in low- and middle-income countries and exclusive in high-income markets. Pretomanid, as part of the BPaL regimen, was recently approved in the USA under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD) pathway for the treatment of adults with pulmonary extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or treatment-intolerant or non-responsive multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Pretomanid is also under regulatory review in the EU. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of pretomanid leading to this first regulatory approval.
The antitubercular drugs are associated with different cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe form of cutaneous reaction. Although it is rare, it carries a high mortality rate. We report a case of a 75-year-old man with abdominal tuberculosis, who developed pyrazinamide-induced TEN.
Pyrazinamide is a sterilizing first-line tuberculosis drug. Genetic, metabolomic and biophysical analyses previously demonstrated that pyrazinoic acid, the bioactive form of the prodrug pyrazinamide (PZA), interrupts biosynthesis of coenzyme A in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by binding to aspartate decarboxylase PanD. While most drugs act by inhibiting protein function upon target binding, we find here that pyrazinoic acid is only a weak enzyme inhibitor. We show that binding of pyrazinoic acid to PanD triggers degradation of the protein by the caseinolytic protease ClpC1-ClpP. Thus, the old tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide exerts antibacterial activity by acting as a target degrader, a mechanism of action that has recently emerged as a successful strategy in drug discovery across disease indications. Our findings provide the basis for the rational discovery of next generation PZA.
