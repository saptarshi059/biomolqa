This article reviews the safety of statins and non-statin medications for management of dyslipidemia. Statins have uncommon serious adverse effects: myopathy/ rhabdomyolysis, which resolve with statin discontinuation, and diabetes, usually in people with risk factors for diabetes. The CVD benefit of statins far exceeds the risk of diabetes. Statin myalgia, without CK elevation, is likely caused by muscle symptoms with another etiology, or the nocebo effect. Notable adverse effects of non-statin medicines include injection site reactions (alirocumab, evolocumab, inclisiran), increased uric acid and gout (bempedoic acid), atrial fibrillation/flutter (omega-3-fatty acids), and myopathy in combination with a statin (gemfibrozil).
Drug-induced myopathy has been reported with use of lovastatin, nicotinic acid, and clofibrate. A particularly severe form, often accompanied by rhabdomyolysis, has been reported with the use of lovastatin and gemfibrozil; however, as far as we know, no case has been documented with use of gemfibrozil alone. Herein, we report the first case (to our knowledge of gemfibrozil-induced myopathy, confirmed by drug rechallenge.
Translating human genetic findings (genome-wide association studies [GWAS]) to pathobiology and therapeutic discovery remains a major challenge for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We present a network topology-based deep learning framework to identify disease-associated genes (NETTAG). We leverage non-coding GWAS loci effects on quantitative trait loci, enhancers and CpG islands, promoter regions, open chromatin, and promoter flanking regions under the protein-protein interactome. Via NETTAG, we identified 156 AD-risk genes enriched in druggable targets. Combining network-based prediction and retrospective case-control observations with 10 million individuals, we identified that usage of four drugs (ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, cholecalciferol, and ceftriaxone) is associated with reduced likelihood of AD incidence. Gemfibrozil (an approved lipid regulator) is significantly associated with 43% reduced risk of AD compared with simvastatin using an active-comparator design (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.63, p < 0.0001). In summary, NETTAG offers a deep learning methodology that utilizes GWAS and multi-genomic findings to identify pathobiology and drug repurposing in AD.
Severe rhabdomyolysis complicated by respiratory and renal failure developed three weeks after initiation of low dose lovastatin therapy in a 79 year old, non-immunocompromised patient. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil may increase the risk of this complication.
Apart from their effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, the nuclear receptors PPARs (peroxysome proliferator-activated receptors) could also be involved in cellular protection. Indeed, an increasing body of literature provides arguments in favour of a protective role of PPAR alpha (fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) and PPAR gamma (ciglitazone, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone) agonists, particularly in myocardial or cerebral ischaemia as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. Such cellular protection could be the result of the modulation, at a molecular level, of inflammation pathways, oxidative stress and apoptosis. If these experimental results are confirmed by appropriate clinical trials, pharmacological modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARs, as well as the development of highly selective and more effective PPAR agonists, could become an important challenge in the field of cellular protection.
