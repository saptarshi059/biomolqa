BACKGROUND: There is a need for new and effective oral asthma therapies. Dexpramipexole, an oral eosinophil-lowering drug, has not previously been studied in asthma. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexpramipexole in lowering blood and airway eosinophilia in subjects with eosinophilic asthma. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial in adults with inadequately controlled moderate to severe asthma and blood absolute eosinophil count (AEC) greater than or equal to 300/muL. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to dexpramipexole 37.5, 75, or 150 mg BID (twice-daily) or placebo. The primary end point was the relative change in AEC from baseline to week 12. Prebronchodilator FEV(1) week-12 change from baseline was a key secondary end point. Nasal eosinophil peroxidase was an exploratory end point. RESULTS: A total of 103 subjects were randomly assigned to dexpramipexole 37.5 mg BID (N = 22), 75 mg BID (N = 26), 150 mg BID (N = 28), or placebo (N = 27). Dexpramipexole significantly reduced placebo-corrected AEC week-12 ratio to baseline, in both the 150-mg BID (ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12-0.43; P < .0001) and the 75-mg BID (ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.65; P = .0014) dose groups, corresponding to 77% and 66% reductions, respectively. Dexpramipexole reduced the exploratory end point of nasal eosinophil peroxidase week-12 ratio to baseline in the 150-mg BID (median, 0.11; P = .020) and the 75-mg BID (median, 0.17; P = .021) groups. Placebo-corrected FEV(1) increases were observed starting at week 4 (nonsignificant). Dexpramipexole displayed a favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Dexpramipexole demonstrated effective eosinophil lowering and was well tolerated. Additional larger clinical trials are needed to understand the clinical efficacy of dexpramipexole in asthma.
Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HESs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophil-related end organ damage. Whereas most patients respond to glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, high doses are often necessary, and side effects are common. Dexpramipexole (KNS-760704), an orally bioavailable synthetic aminobenzothiazole, showed an excellent safety profile and was coincidentally noted to significantly decrease absolute eosinophil counts (AECs) in a phase 3 trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This proof-of-concept study was designed to evaluate dexpramipexole (150 mg orally twice daily) as a GC-sparing agent in HESs. Dual primary end points were (1) the proportion of subjects with >/=50% decrease in the minimum effective GC dose (MED) to maintain AEC <1000/muL and control clinical symptoms, and (2) the MED after 12 weeks of dexpramipexole (MEDD) as a percentage of the MED at week 0. Out of 10 subjects, 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%, 74%) achieved a >/=50% reduction in MED, and the MEDD/MED ratio was significantly <100% (median, 66%; 95% CI, 6%, 98%; P = .03). All adverse events were self-limited, and none led to drug discontinuation. Affected tissue biopsy samples in 2 subjects showed normalization of pathology and depletion of eosinophils on dexpramipexole. Bone marrow biopsy samples after 12 weeks of dexpramipexole showed selective absence of mature eosinophils in responders. Dexpramipexole appears promising as a GC-sparing agent without apparent toxicity in a subset of subjects with GC-responsive HESs. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, preliminary data suggest that dexpramipexole may affect eosinophil maturation in the bone marrow. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02101138.
Dexpramipexole, an orally bioavailable small molecule previously under clinical development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was observed during routine safety hematology monitoring to demonstrate pronounced, dose- and time-dependent eosinophil-lowering effects, with minor reductions on other leukocyte counts. Analysis of hematology lab values across two double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials at total daily doses ranging from 50mg to 300mg demonstrated that dexpramipexole consistently and markedly lowered peripheral blood eosinophils. This effect developed after 1month on treatment, required 3-4months to reach its maximum, remained constant throughout treatment, and partially recovered to baseline levels upon drug withdrawal. All doses tested were well tolerated. The overall adverse event rate was similar for dexpramipexole and placebo, and notably with no increase in infection-related adverse events associated with eosinophil-lowering effects. Given the reliance on and insufficiency of off-label chronic corticosteroid therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes and other eosinophilic-associated diseases (EADs), a need exists for less toxic, more effective, targeted therapeutic alternatives. Further clinical studies are underway to assess the eosinophil-lowering effect of dexpramipexole in the peripheral blood and target tissues of EAD patients and whether such reductions, if observed, produce clinically important benefits.
This phase I, open-label, single-dose study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of renally excreted drug dexpramipexole in subjects with normal and impaired renal function, i.e. mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis when matched by age and sex. Dexpramipexole area under the curves (AUCs), but not Cmax , were significantly increased with the severity of renal impairment after a single dose administration. The geometric mean ratio of dose-normalized AUC(0-72) was 1.4, 1.7, 2.7, and 4.5, respectively, in mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, and ESRD subjects when compared to healthy subjects. There was a strong association between renal function (eGFR) and dexpramipexole CLr. The slope (90% confidence interval(CI)) of eGFR and renal clearance (CLr) in the regression model was 3.1 (2.4, 3.7). Dexpramipexole elimination in ESRD subjects during both dialysis and non-dialysis (i.e., interval between dialysis) was insignificant. Single 75 mg and 150 mg doses of dexpramipexole were well tolerated, and the safety profile was comparable across renal function groups. Extensive drug accumulation may occur with repeated dosing in patients with significant renal impairment. It is recommended that dexpramipexole not to be given to patients with severe renal impairment or in those with ESRD.
OBJECTIVE: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and eosinophilia is a disease of the upper respiratory tract for which few therapies are available. Because the oral investigational drug dexpramipexole serendipitously decreased blood eosinophils in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis studies, we assessed its safety, eosinophil-lowering activity, and preliminary clinical efficacy in patients with CRSwNP and eosinophilia. METHODS: Sixteen subjects with CRSwNP, absolute eosinophil count (AEC) >/= 0.300 x 10(9) /L, and polyp tissue eosinophils were evaluable for efficacy in a 6-month open-label, multi-center study of dexpramipexole 150 mg twice daily. The coprimary endpoints were change in AEC and change in total polyp score (TPS) from baseline to month 6, with additional clinical and histologic endpoints assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen of 16 subjects completed 6 months of dexpramipexole treatment. Geometric mean baseline AEC was 0.525 +/- 0.465 eosinophils x 10(9) /L and decreased to 0.031 +/- 0.019 after 6 months of dexpramipexole treatment, a 94% reduction (P < 0.001). Ten of 16 subjects had eosinophil counts reduced to </= 0.020 x 10(9) /L at month 6. In 12 subjects with nasal polyp biopsies at baseline and month 6, tissue eosinophils were reduced from a mean of 168 +/- 134 to 5 +/- 2 per high-power field (HPF) (P = 0.001), a 97% reduction from baseline. There was no significant reduction in TPS or improvement in other clinical endpoints. Dexpramipexole was well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Dexpramipexole treatment produced profound eosinophil-lowering in peripheral blood and nasal polyp tissue. Despite the near-elimination of polyp eosinophils, decreased TPS and nasal symptom improvement were not observed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Laryngoscope, 129:E61-E66, 2019.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction and loss, rapidly progressive muscle weakness, wasting and death. Many factors, including mitochondrial dysfunction, may contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Riluzole, which has shown only modest benefits in a measure of survival time without demonstrated effects on muscle strength or function, is the only approved treatment for ALS. We tested the putative mitochondrial modulator dexpramipexole (KNS-760704; (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine) in subjects with ALS in a two-part, double-blind safety and tolerability study, with a preliminary assessment of its effects on functional decline and mortality. In part 1, the effects of dexpramipexole (50, 150 or 300 mg d(-1)) versus placebo were assessed over 12 weeks. In part 2, after a 4-week, single-blind placebo washout, continuing subjects were re-randomized to dexpramipexole at 50 mg d(-1) or 300 mg d(-1) as double-blind active treatment for 24 weeks. Dexpramipexole was safe and well tolerated. Trends showing a dose-dependent attenuation of the slope of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) in part 1 and a statistically significant (P = 0.046) difference between groups in a joint rank test of change from baseline in ALSFRS-R and mortality in part 2 strongly support further testing of dexpramipexole in ALS.
BACKGROUND: In a phase 2 study, dexpramipexole (25-150 mg twice daily) was well tolerated for up to 9 months and showed a significant benefit at the high dose in a combined assessment of function and mortality in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of dexpramipexole in a phase 3 trial of patients with familial or sporadic disease. METHODS: In our randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (EMPOWER), we enrolled participants aged 18-80 years (with first amyotrophic lateral sclerosis symptom onset 24 months or less before baseline) at 81 academic medical centres in 11 countries. We randomly allocated eligible participants (1:1) with a centralised voice-interactive online system to twice-daily dexpramipexole 150 mg or matched placebo for 12-18 months, stratified by trial site, area of disease onset (bulbar vs other areas), and previous use of riluzole. The primary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) score, based on changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) total scores and time to death up to 12 months. We assessed the primary endpoint in all participants who received at least one dose and had at least one post-dose ALSFRS-R measurement or died. We monitored adverse events in all participants. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01281189. FINDINGS: Between March 28, 2011, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 943 participants (474 randomly allocated dexpramipexole, 468 randomly allocated placebo, and one withdrew). Least-square mean CAFS scores at 12 months did not differ between participants in the dexpramipexole group (score 441.76, 95% CI 415.43-468.08) and those in the placebo group (438.84, 412.81-464.88; p=0.86). At 12 months, we noted no differences in mean change from baseline in ALSFRS-R total score (-13.34 in the dexpramipexole group vs -13.42 in the placebo group; p=0.90) or time to death (74 [16%] vs 79 [17%]; hazard ratio 1.03 [0.75-1.43]; p=0.84). 37 (8%) participants in the dexpramipexole group developed neutropenia compared with eight (2%) participants in the placebo group, and incidence of other adverse events was similar between groups. INTERPRETATION: Dexpramipexole was generally well tolerated but did not differ from placebo on any prespecified efficacy endpoint measurement. Our trial can inform the design of future clinical research strategies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. FUNDING: Biogen Idec.
