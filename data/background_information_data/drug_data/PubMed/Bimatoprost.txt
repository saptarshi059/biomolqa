Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a form of macular retina thickening that is characterized by the appearance of cystic fluid-filled intraretinal spaces. It has classically been diagnosed upon investigation after a decrease in visual acuity; however, improvements in imaging technology make it possible to noninvasively detect CME even before a clinically significant decrease in central vision. Risk factors for the development of CME include diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, uveitis, and cataract surgery. It has been proposed that eyes with elevated intraocular pressure after cataract surgery, including those treated with prostaglandin analog eye drops, may be at higher risk for the development of CME. We summarize the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying CME, the potential role of ocular surgery and topical glaucoma medication in increasing the risk of CME, the newly developed imaging methods for diagnosing CME, and the clinical management of CME.
Existing guidelines form no consensus for alopecia areata (AA) treatment due to the absence of a universal standard treatment and arbitrary selection of reference arms in randomized control trials (RCTs). The aim is to identify the best treatment and to rank treatments using systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data were extracted by the two investigators independently. Odds ratio (OR) of treatment success rate was pooled using the frequentist weighted least squares approach to random-model network meta-analysis. RCTs providing data of treatment success rate from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and manual search were included. About 54 RCTs consisting of 49 treatments and 3149 patients were included. Pentoxifylline plus topical corticosteroids had the highest treatment success rate compared with "no treatment," followed by pentoxifylline alone, topical calcipotriol plus narrowband ultraviolet radiation B phototherapy, topical calcipotriol, intralesional corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, minoxidil plus topical corticosteroids, topical bimatoprost, psoralen ultraviolet radiation A phototherapy, and tofacitinib. Even with the network meta-analysis, the best treatment because of independent loops and wide confidence intervals could not be identified. Treatment options above may be reasonable strategies, but further comparison is required.
An 81-year-old man with primary open-angle glaucoma on dorzolamide-timolol, bimatoprost and 0.02% netarsudil ophthalmic solution (Rhopressa), was found to have right lower lid basal cell carcinoma. The patient underwent Mohs surgery followed by repair of the right lower lid, with 3 episodes of wound dehiscence. When stopping netarsudil, appropriate granulation tissue was able to develop. While off netarsudil, the patient underwent Mohs resection of a left lower lid basal cell carcinoma, which was able to granulate well via secondary intention.
PURPOSE   : To compare the efficacy and safety of the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of netarsudil 0.02%/latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution (NET/LAT; Roclanda((R))) with bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol maleate 0.5% (BIM/TIM; Ganfort((R))) ophthalmic solution in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). METHODS: MERCURY-3 was a 6-month prospective, double-masked, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority study. Patients (>/= 18 years) with a diagnosis of OAG or OHT in both eyes that was insufficiently controlled with topical medication (IOP >/= 17 mmHg in >/= 1 eye and < 28 mmHg in both eyes) were included. Following washout, patients were randomized to once-daily NET/LAT or BIM/TIM for up to 6 months; efficacy was assessed at Week 2, Week 4, and Month 3; safety was evaluated for 6 months. Comparison of NET/LAT relative to BIM/TIM for mean IOP at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 h was assessed at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. Non-inferiority of NET/LAT to BIM/TIM was defined as a difference of </= 1.5 mmHg at all nine time points through Month 3 and </= 1.0 mmHg at five or more of nine time points through Month 3. RESULTS: Overall, 430 patients were randomized (NET/LAT, n = 218; BIM/TIM, n = 212), and all received at least one dose of study medication. Efficacy analyses were performed at Month 3 on 388 patients (NET/LAT, n = 184; BIM/TIM, n = 204). NET/LAT demonstrated non-inferiority to BIM/TIM, with a between-treatment difference in IOP of </= 1.5 mmHg achieved at all time points and </= 1.0 mmHg at the majority of time points (six of nine) through Month 3. Mean diurnal IOP during the study ranged from 15.4 to 15.6 mmHg and 15.2 to 15.6 mmHg in the NET/LAT and BIM/TIM groups respectively, with no between-group statistically significant difference. No significant differences were observed in key secondary endpoints. No serious, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were observed, and AEs were typically mild/moderate in severity. The most common treatment-related AEs were conjunctival hyperemia (NET/LAT, 30.7%; BIM/TIM, 9.0%) and cornea verticillata (NET/LAT, 11.0%; BIM/TIM, 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily NET/LAT was non-inferior to BIM/TIM in IOP reduction in OAG and OHT, with AEs consistent with previous findings. NET/LAT offers a compelling alternative FDC treatment option for OAG and OHT.
The treatment of glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure has relied traditionally on inhibiting aqueous humor secretion (inflow). However, recent therapeutic approaches have targeted aqueous humor outflow. Prostanoid FP receptor agonists selectively increase uveoscleral outflow and the prostamide analog bimatoprost alters trabecular and uveoscleral outflow. An emerging therapeutic strategy is direct neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cells, which are selectively lost in glaucoma.
