CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms affect the exposure, efficacy and safety of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with some drugs being affected by CYP2D6 only (e.g., nortriptyline and desipramine) and others by both polymorphic enzymes (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine). Evidence is presented for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype-directed dosing of TCAs. This document is an update to the 2012 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Tricyclic Antidepressants.
We assessed the effect of treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine, on peripheral thyroid hormone levels in 28 severely depressed patients. Only those whose depression responded showed a decrease in their thyroxine levels without alteration of other thyroid function tests. In a second study involving 38 depressed patients, we observed an increased response to antidepressant treatment with the addition of triiodothyronine but not equivalent doses of thyroxine (T4). The finding is consistent with the decreases in plasma T4 levels which accompany an antidepressant response to desipramine.
Sexual dysfunction secondary to antidepressant drugs is an under-recognized clinical problem, and likely an important factor in noncompliance with treatment. We report two patients with anhedonic ejaculation (ejaculation without orgasm) associated with initiation of treatment with desipramine.
It is proposed that factors including a long "track record," perceived lack of anticholinergic effects, suggestions of earlier onset of action, and the concept of noradrenergic specificity have contributed to the widespread clinical use of desipramine. Recent studies bearing on these clinical beliefs are reviewed, with a focus on desipramine side effects, specificity, and speed of onset as compared to other tricyclics and to new generation antidepressants.
The pharmacokinetic linearity of two single oral doses of desipramine hydrochloride was examined in a parallel study involving 30 subjects. Fourteen subjects received 75 mg (3 x 25 mg) of desipramine hydrochloride, and 16 subjects received 150 mg (1 x 150 mg). An open one-compartment model with a lag time to the start of absorption was used to examine the pharmacokinetic linearity. The results of the study suggest that the kinetics are linear in the dose range studied.
