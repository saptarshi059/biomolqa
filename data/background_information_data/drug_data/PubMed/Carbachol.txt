The effects of single doses of clonidine hydrochloride (200 micrograms), yohimbine hydrochloride (22 mg), a combination of the two treatments, and placebo, on some autonomic functions were studied in healthy volunteers using a double-blind crossover design. Clonidine prolonged the recovery time of the light reflex, lowered systolic blood pressure and reduced subjectively rated alertness; these effects were reversed by yohimbine. Responsiveness of sweat glands to carbachol was not affected by the treatments.
Carbachol instilled in 125 eyes at the time of extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber lens insertion had a statistically significant effect on lowering the postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) at 24 hours (average IOP 14.0 mm Hg) and at 72 hours (average IOP 11.6 mm Hg) (P less than .001). The percentage of patients with an acute IOP elevation at 24 hours was also significantly reduced: carbachol 10% versus control 33% (P = .001). Carbachol's prolonged lowering of postoperative IOP may increase the safety of cataract surgery, particularly in patients with compromised optic nerves.
Intraventricular administration of carbachol chloride evoked wet-dog shakes (WDS) in rats in a dose-related manner. WDS induced by carbachol at the dose of 20 microgram were antagonized by scopolamine, atropine, cyproheptadine, morphine, clonidine, phentolamine, haloperidol, and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Methergoline, propranolol, bicuculline, and aminooxyacetic acid had no effect on carbachol-induced shaking behavior. The present experiments show the existence of different types of shaking behavior, not exclusively related to the stimulation of central 5-HT structures.
Ocular hypotensive actions of N-demethylated carbachol hydrochloride (DMC) were studied in patients with open angle glaucoma; 1% pilocarpine hydrochloride solution was used as a reference. Although 1% pilocarpine seemed to be slightly more potent that 6% and 9% DMC solutions, DMC solutions were devoid of the noticeable side effects produced by pilocarpine. In all cases, maximum ocular hypotensive actions were observed six hours after the single-drop medication and were determined as 4.2, 4.6, and 4.8 mm Hg with 6% DMC, 9% DMC, and 1% pilocarpine, respectively.
Concentration-dependent contractions in response to carbachol were determined on isolated pieces of human iris. Atropine competivtively antagonized the effect of carbachol. An apparent dissociation equilibrium constant of 0.4--0.7 nM was estimated for the muscarine receptor-atropine complex.
