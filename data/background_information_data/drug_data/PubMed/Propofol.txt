Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is a hypnotic drug with a very rapid onset and offset of action. It has increasingly been used in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Administration of propofol by nurses or endoscopists is commonly referred to as non-anesthesiologist-administered propofol (NAAP). There have been a lot of studies on the safety of NAAP compared with those by anesthesiologists. Safety results of those studies are summarized in this review.
BACKGROUND: Remimazolam is a new medication with sedative and hypnotic effects. It has been demonstrated non-inferior to propofol in general anesthesia with regard to efficacy and safety. However, whether general anesthesia with remimazolam is better than propofol in terms of patients' recovery quality remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in this study were randomized to remimazolam or propofol group. In remimazolam group, general anesthesia was induced with remimazolam and sufentanil and maintained with remimazolam and remifentanil. In propofol group, general anesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium was also injected during anesthesia. Sedation level was monitored by bispectral index (BIS). Our primary outcome was the quality of patients' postoperative recovery, using the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) scale. Secondary outcomes included SpO(2), HR, MBP and frequency of application of vasoactive drugs during anesthesia, as well as incidences of adverse events in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RESULTS: The global scores of QoR-15 scale were lower in remimazolam group at postoperative day 1 and day 3 compared to propofol group, but differences between the two groups only had clinical significance at postoperative day 1. Among the five dimensions of QoR-15 scale, scores for physical comfort and emotional state were lower in remimazolam group than propofol group. MBP and HR were higher in remimazolam group than propofol group after anesthesia induction. SpO(2) was similar in the two groups. The frequency of application of vasoactive drugs during anesthesia was higher in propofol group than remimazolam group. There was no statistical difference in the incidences of adverse events between the two groups. CONCLUSION: General anesthesia with remimazolam can provide more stable hemodynamics but also cause temporary reduction in the quality of recovery in patients undergoing urologic surgery, compared to propofol.
Propofol is an established anesthetic widely used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. We investigated propofol for its anti-inflammatory effects on microglia and found that propofol treatment is associated with substantial lower levels of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in immune activated microglia. Importantly, EVs collected from immune activated microglia reversed propofol-mediated anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, suggesting that propofol reduces proinflammatory microglia activation and microglia-mediated neurotoxicity through inhibition of EV release. These data shed new insight into a novel molecular mechanism of propofol-mediated neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects through inhibition of EV release.
Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using a mixture of propofol and remifentanil in the same syringe has become an accepted technique in Pediatric Anesthesia. A survey by a group of respected UK anesthetists demonstrated a low incidence of serious complications, related to the pharmacology and dose of the drugs. However, a current guideline for the safe use of TIVA recommends against this practice. Pharmaceutical concerns include the physical stability of the emulsion when remifentanil is mixed with propofol; changes in drug concentration over time; nonuniform mixing of propofol and remifentanil; the risk of bacterial contamination; and the potential for drug administration errors. Propofol and remifentanil have markedly different pharmacokinetic profiles. When remifentanil is mixed with propofol and delivered as a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol, remifentanil delivery is not target-controlled but passively follows the variable infusion rates calculated by the syringe driver to deliver predicted plasma or effect-site concentrations of propofol. The pharmacokinetic consequences can be illustrated using pharmacokinetic modeling similar to that used in TCI pumps. The clinical consequences reflect the dose-dependent pharmacodynamics of remifentanil. Increasing the target propofol concentration produces a rapid increase and peak in remifentanil concentration that risks apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially with higher concentrations of remifentanil. The faster decline in remifentanil concentration with falling propofol concentrations risks inadequate narcosis and unwanted responses to surgical stimuli. Remifentanil delivery is inflexible and dosing cannot be adjusted to the clinical need and responses of individual patients. The medicolegal considerations are stark. In UK and EU Law, mixing propofol and remifentanil creates a new, unlicensed drug and the person mixing takes on the responsibilities of manufacturer. If a patient receiving anesthesia in the form of a mixed propofol-remifentanil infusion suffered a critical incident or actual harm, the clinician's practice may come under scrutiny and criticism, potentially involving a legal challenge and the Medical Regulator.
A case in which the intraoperative administration of propofol was strongly associated with an acute episode of diabetes insipidus is presented.
