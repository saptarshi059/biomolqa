Second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) have been developed to reduce or eliminate the sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects that occur with older H1 receptor antagonists. This article evaluates second-generation antihistamines, including acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, ketotifen, loratadine, mizolastine and terfenadine, for significant features that affect choice. In addition to their primary mechanism of antagonising histamine at the H1 receptor, these agents may act on other mediators of the allergic reaction. However, the clinical significance of activity beyond that mediated by histamine H1 receptor antagonism has yet to be demonstrated. Most of the agents reviewed are metabolised by the liver to active metabolites that play a significant role in their effect. Conditions that result in accumulation of astemizole, ebastine and terfenadine may prolong the QT interval and result in torsade de pointes. The remaining agents reviewed do not appear to have this risk. For allergic rhinitis, all agents are effective and the choice should be based on other factors. For urticaria, cetirizine and mizolastine demonstrate superior suppression of wheal and flare at the dosages recommended by the manufacturer. For atopic dermatitis, as adjunctive therapy to reduce pruritus, cetirizine, ketotifen and loratadine demonstrate efficacy. Although current evidence does not suggest a primary role for these agents in the management of asthma, it does support their use for asthmatic patients when there is coexisting allergic rhinitis, dermatitis or urticaria.
The incidence of anticholinergic syndrome due to second generation antihistamines is infrequently reported. Largely due to their decreased affinity for central nervous system (CNS) receptors, second generation antihistamines are rarely associated with anticholinergic symptoms, though toxicity is still possible particularly when taken in excess. We report a case of a six year old boy who presented with agitation, hallucinations, fixed and dilated pupils, tachycardia, and hyperthermia consistent with anticholinergic toxicity several hours after accidental overdose of a second generation antihistamine, cetirizine. Early identification of this rare phenomenon is important not only for appropriate emergency management but also for avoidance of potentially invasive and unnecessary tests which may further increase patient morbidity.
PURPOSE: Prostaglandins play a pivotal role in modulating hair growth cycle. Prostaglandin F2alpha and prostaglandin E have stimulating and prostaglandin D has inhibitory effects on hair follicle. Cetirizine inhibits release of prostaglandin D2 and stimulates the release of prostaglandin E2. In the present study, the efficacy and safety of twice daily application of topical cetirizine 1% versus minoxidil 5% solutions for 16 weeks were compared in male androgenetic alopecia (AGA). METHODS: Forty men, aged 18 to 49 years, ‎were randomly divided into two equal groups to apply either cetirizine 1% or minoxidil 5% solutions. The study was divided into two phases, a 16-week treatment phase either with cetirizine or minoxidil (anagen phase), followed by an 8-week ‎ drug-free (telogen phase) with a follow-up when patients used placebo. Efficacy outcomes included the change in total hair density, vellus and terminal hair density, hair diameter and the percentage of hair in anagen and telogen phases from baseline in 16 and 24 weeks. RESULTS: After 16 weeks, we observed a significant increase in total and vellus hair density in both minoxidil and cetirizine groups, but the improvement was much higher in the minoxidil group. The percentage of hair in the anagen phase also increased in both groups after 16 weeks of treatment, but then diminished after 8 weeks of placebo consumption. No significant adverse reactions associated with the administration of cetirizine solution were reported. CONCLUSION: Cetirizine 1% solution was effective in hair growth without any complications for treatment of male AGA.
Cetirizine is the carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, and has high specific affinity for histamine H(1) receptors. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug that acts directly on alpha-adrenergic receptors. black triangle Cetirizine/pseudoephedrine 5/120 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than intranasal budesonide 100 microg or placebo at improving nasal obstruction, nasal patency and reducing the volume of nasal secretion, and was significantly more effective than intranasal xylometazoline 0.1% with respect to nasal secretion, during house dust mite faeces challenge in three randomised, cross- over studies among volunteers with seasonal or perennial rhinitis. The onset of action of cetirizine/pseudoephedrine was reported to be approximately 30 minutes. black triangle The bioavailability of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine is similar after administration of cetirizine/pseudoephedrine 5/120 mg bilayer tablets or coadministration of cetirizine 5 mg tablets plus pseudoephedrine sustained-release (SR) 120 mg caplets. black triangle Cetirizine 5mg plus pseudoephedrine SR 120 mg twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks was significantly more effective than each drug given alone at reducing mean total symptom scores for seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in two randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials. In both studies, the mean proportion of days during which the five measured symptoms (nasal obstruction, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus and ocular pruritus) were absent or mild was significantly greater in recipients of the cetirizine plus pseudoephedrine SR. black triangle In one study, cetirizine 5 mg plus pseudoephedrine SR 120 mg was significantly more effective at reducing nasal obstruction than either drug alone. black triangle Cetirizine 5mg plus pseudoephedrine SR 120 mg twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks was well tolerated in patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. The most common adverse events were dry mouth, insomnia, headache, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness.
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common cause of hair loss in both genders with a higher psychological impact on females. Currently, topical minoxidil is the only FDA-approved treatment for female AGA and it needs life-long application and causes side effects. Cetirizine is an antihistamine that may be effective in hair loss treatment. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of topical cetirizine with minoxidil (group 1) versus topical minoxidil with placebo (group 2) in female patients with AGA. This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel study conducted at Dermatology Clinic, Cairo University Teaching Hospital (Kasr- Al- Ainy), Egypt. Sixty-six patients with female AGA, aged 20-50 years, Sinclair (II-IV), were randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups for 24 weeks. The trichoscopic parameters, patients' self-assessment, side effects and global photographic assessment were evaluated. There was a statistically significant change from baseline in frontal and vertex terminal and vellus hair density (P < 0.0005) with a significant increase in vertex hair shaft thickness and average number of hairs per follicular unit in group 1 (P < 0.05). Patients reported significantly better scores in patient self-assessment in group 1 (P < 0.05). Side effects were not significantly different between groups (P > 0.05). Topical cetirizine increases hair shaft thickness and results in a higher clinical improvement from patients' perspective with a good safety profile (NCT04481412, study start date: July 2020).
