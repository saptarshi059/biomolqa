Methylation is an essential biochemical mechanism that is central to the transmission of life, and crucially responsible for regulating gametogenesis and continued embryo development. The methylation of DNA and histones drives cell division and regulation of gene expression through epigenesis and imprinting. Brain development and its maturation also depend on correct lipid methylation, and continued neuronal function depends on biogenic amines that require methylation for their synthesis. All methylation processes are carried out via a methyltransferase enzyme and its unique co-factor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM); the transfer of a methyl group to a target molecule results in the release of SAH (SA homocysteine), and then homocysteine (Hcy). Both of these molecules are toxic, inhibiting methylation in a variety of ways, and Hcy recycling to methionine is imperative; this is achieved via the one carbon cycle, supported by the folates cycle. Folate deficiency causes hyperhomocysteinaemia, with several associated diseases; during early pregnancy, deficiency interferes with closure of the neural tube at the fourth week of gestation, and nutraceutical supplementation has been routinely prescribed to prevent neural tube defects, mainly involving B vitamins, Zn and folates. The two metabolic pathways are subject to single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter their activity/capacity, often severely, impairing specific physiological functions including fertility, brain and cardiac function. The impact of three types of nutraceutical supplements, folic acid (FA), folinic acid (FLA) and 5 Methyl THF (MTHF), will be discussed here, with their positive effects alongside potentially hazardous secondary effects. The issue surrounding FA and its association with UMFA (unmetabolized folic acid) syndrome is now a matter of concern, as UMFA is currently found in the umbilical cord of the fetus, and even in infants' blood. We will discuss its putative role in influencing the acquisition of epigenetic marks in the germline, acquired during embryogenesis, as well as the role of FA in the management of cancerous disease.
BACKGROUND: Nanoliposomal irinotecan showed activity in a phase 2 study in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapies. We assessed the effect of nanoliposomal irinotecan alone or combined with fluorouracil and folinic acid in a phase 3 trial in this population. METHODS: We did a global, phase 3, randomised, open-label trial at 76 sites in 14 countries. Eligible patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system at a central location to receive either nanoliposomal irinotecan monotherapy (120 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, equivalent to 100 mg/m(2) of irinotecan base) or fluorouracil and folinic acid. A third arm consisting of nanoliposomal irinotecan (80 mg/m(2), equivalent to 70 mg/m(2) of irinotecan base) with fluorouracil and folinic acid every 2 weeks was added later (1:1:1), in a protocol amendment. Randomisation was stratified by baseline albumin, Karnofsky performance status, and ethnic origin. Treatment was continued until disease progression or intolerable toxic effects. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The primary analysis was planned after 305 events. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01494506. FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2012, and Sept 11, 2013, 417 patients were randomly assigned either nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and folinic acid (n=117), nanoliposomal irinotecan monotherapy (n=151), or fluorouracil and folinic acid (n=149). After 313 events, median overall survival in patients assigned nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and folinic acid was 6.1 months (95% CI 4.8-8.9) vs 4.2 months (3.3-5.3) with fluorouracil and folinic acid (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92; p=0.012). Median overall survival did not differ between patients assigned nanoliposomal irinotecan monotherapy and those allocated fluorouracil and folinic acid (4.9 months [4.2-5.6] vs 4.2 months [3.6-4.9]; 0.99, 0.77-1.28; p=0.94). The grade 3 or 4 adverse events that occurred most frequently in the 117 patients assigned nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil and folinic acid were neutropenia (32 [27%]), diarrhoea (15 [13%]), vomiting (13 [11%]), and fatigue (16 [14%]). INTERPRETATION: Nanoliposomal irinotecan in combination with fluorouracil and folinic acid extends survival with a manageable safety profile in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who previously received gemcitabine-based therapy. This agent represents a new treatment option for this population. FUNDING: Merrimack Pharmaceuticals.
BACKGROUND: A folic-acid antagonist, methotrexate, is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs with its expanding use in clinical practice. The drug requires regular monitoring given its wide range of adverse effects including bone marrow suppression, hepatic or renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal distress, mucocutaneous damage, and neurotoxicity. The toxicity usually occurs rapidly and leads to severe neutropenia, sepsis, and advanced renal failure that are difficult to manage. METHODS: This review is an update for the clinicians to understand the pharmacology, clinical features, laboratory evaluation, and treatment of patients with methotrexate overdose. High-quality literature of the past six decades was collected and reviewed in this article. Several landmark articles were reviewed using PubMed, EMBASE Ovid, and the Cochrane Library, that have important implications in current clinical practice. RESULTS: Methotrexate overdose has complex toxicokinetic and produces myriad clinical features mimicking conditions of lesser severity. Organ dysfunction related to bone marrow, kidney or central nervous system is lifethreatening. The management should focus on high-quality supportive care, antidotal therapy (folinic acid and carboxypeptidase- G2) and plasma alkalization. CONCLUSION: In accordance with the dictum "prevention is better than cure", the author emphasizes on the role of patient education, regular clinical observation, and laboratory monitoring for prompt recognition and diagnosis of methotrexate overdosing at the earliest stage.
Pemetrexed is a cytostatic antifolate drug and a cornerstone in the treatment of lung cancer. Although generally well tolerated, a substantial part of the patient population experiences dose-limiting or even treatment-limiting toxicities. These include mucositis, skin problems, fatigue, renal toxicity, and neutropenia. Several studies confirmed that pemetrexed pharmacokinetics can serve as a prognostic factor for the development of toxicity, especially for neutropenia. Preventing and managing toxicity of pemetrexed can help to ensure durable treatment. Several evidence-based strategies are already implemented in clinical care. With the introduction of standard vitamin supplementation and dexamethasone, the incidence of hematological toxicity and skin reactions substantially decreased. In the case of high risk for toxicity, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can be used to prevent severe hematological toxicity. Moreover, high-dose folinic acid can resolve severe pemetrexed-induced toxicity. There are several experimental options to prevent or manage pemetrexed-related toxicity, such as the use of standard folinic acid, hemodialysis, antidotes such as thymidine, hypoxanthine, and glucarpidase, and the use of therapeutic drug monitoring. These strategies still need clinical evaluation before implementation, but could enable treatment with pemetrexed for patients who are at risk for toxicity, such as in renal impairment.
BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic or haematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects. OBJECTIVES: To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid (a) in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and haematologic side effects of MTX, and (b) whether or not folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit. SEARCH METHODS: We originally performed MEDLINE searches, from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to 2 March 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of </= 7 mg weekly). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for each outcome as assessed by GRADE, with the exception of haematologic side effects which were rated as 'low'. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled.For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) whilst on MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; P = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; P < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason (60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; P < 0.00001).We analysed the effect of folic or folinic acid on the incidence of stomatitis / mouth sores, and whilst showing a trend towards reduction in risk, the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06)It was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of folic or folinic acid on haematologic side effects of methotrexate due to small numbers of events and poor reporting of this outcome in included trials.It does not appear that supplementation with either folic or folinic acid has a statistically significant effect on the efficacy of MTX in treating RA (as measured by RA disease activity parameters such as tender and swollen joint counts, or physician's global assessment scores). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX.There was a significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects, hepatic dysfunction (asmeasured by elevated serum transaminase levels) as well as a significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason. A trend towards a reduction in stomatitis was demonstrated however this did not reach statistical significance.This updated review with its focus on lower doses of folic acid and folinic acid and updated assessment of risk of bias aimed to give a more precise and more clinically relevant estimate of the benefit of folate supplementation for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate.
