Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the most common form of alopecia in women. FPHL may compromise body image and strongly affect self-esteem, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for its treatment is topical minoxidil, with a variable response rate. Recently, a few studies in FPHL have pointed out bicalutamide as an emergent selective androgen receptor antagonist with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. This review aimed to summarize and discuss the key information on this new therapy for FPHL. Bicalutamide has no diuretic effect. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, and it has little effect on serum luteinizing hormone. Additionally, bicalutamide was found to be effective on women presenting with other features of hyperandrogenism such as seborrhea, acne, and hirsutism with mild and well-tolerated adverse effects. Despite the high prevalence and psychosocial impairment, FPHL treatment remains challenging. Therefore, although future prospective, comparative, randomized clinical trials are essential to establish the ideal dose and efficacy of the drug, oral bicalutamide appears to be a promising option to expand the arsenal of FPHL treatment.
BACKGROUND: Salvage radiation therapy is often necessary in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy and have evidence of prostate-cancer recurrence signaled by a persistently or recurrently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Whether antiandrogen therapy with radiation therapy will further improve cancer control and prolong overall survival is unknown. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1998 through 2003, we assigned 760 eligible patients who had undergone prostatectomy with a lymphadenectomy and had disease, as assessed on pathological testing, with a tumor stage of T2 (confined to the prostate but with a positive surgical margin) or T3 (with histologic extension beyond the prostatic capsule), no nodal involvement, and a detectable PSA level of 0.2 to 4.0 ng per milliliter to undergo radiation therapy and receive either antiandrogen therapy (24 months of bicalutamide at a dose of 150 mg daily) or daily placebo tablets during and after radiation therapy. The primary end point was the rate of overall survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up among the surviving patients was 13 years. The actuarial rate of overall survival at 12 years was 76.3% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 71.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.99; P=0.04). The 12-year incidence of death from prostate cancer, as assessed by means of central review, was 5.8% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 13.4% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at 12 years was 14.5% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 23.0% in the placebo group (P=0.005). The incidence of late adverse events associated with radiation therapy was similar in the two groups. Gynecomastia was recorded in 69.7% of the patients in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 10.9% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 24 months of antiandrogen therapy with daily bicalutamide to salvage radiation therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of long-term overall survival and lower incidences of metastatic prostate cancer and death from prostate cancer than radiation therapy plus placebo.

BACKGROUND: Rezvilutamide, a novel androgen-receptor inhibitor with low blood-brain barrier penetration, has shown potent antitumour activity against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rezvilutamide versus bicalutamide in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for high-volume, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. METHODS: CHART is a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 72 hospitals in China, Poland, Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and had high-volume metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Previous chemotherapy or other localised treatment for prostate cancer were not allowed. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ADT plus either rezvilutamide (240 mg) or bicalutamide (50 mg) orally once daily. Randomisation was done via an interactive response technology system (block size of four) and stratified according to ECOG performance status and presence of visceral metastasis (excluding lymph nodes). Herein, we present the results of the preplanned interim analyses for the two co-primary endpoints of radiographic progression-free survival assessed by a blinded independent review committee and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This study is ongoing, but is closed to recruitment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03520478. FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2018, and Aug 6, 2020, 792 patients were screened and 654 patients were randomly assigned to receive rezvilutamide plus ADT (n=326) or bicalutamide plus ADT (n=328). At the preplanned interim analysis for radiographic progression-free survival (data cutoff May 16, 2021), the median follow-up duration was 21.2 months (IQR 16.6-25.8). Rezvilutamide significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival compared with bicalutamide (median radiographic progression-free survival not reached [95% CI not reached-not reached] vs 25.1 months [95% CI 15.7-not reached]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.33-0.58]; p&lt;0.0001). At the preplanned interim analysis for overall survival (data cutoff Feb 28, 2022), the median follow-up duration was 29.3 months (IQR 21.0-33.3). Rezvilutamide significantly improved overall survival compared with bicalutamide (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.44-0.77]; p=0.0001; median overall survival was not reached [95% CI not reached-not reached] vs not reached [36.2-not reached]). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause in the safety population were hypertension (26 [8%] of 323 patients in the rezvilutamide group vs 24 [7%] of 324 patients in the bicalutamide group), hypertriglyceridaemia (24 [7%] vs seven [2%]), increased weight (20 [6%] vs 12 [4%]), anaemia (12 [4%] vs 16 [5%]), and hypokalaemia (11 [3%] vs four [1%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 90 (28%) of 323 patients in the rezvilutamide group and 69 (21%) of 324 patients in the bicalutamide group. No treatment-related deaths occurred in patients in the rezvilutamide group; one treatment-related death of unknown specific cause (&lt;1%) occurred in the bicalutamide group. INTERPRETATION: In the two interim analyses, rezvilutamide plus ADT significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival compared with bicalutamide plus ADT in patients with high-volume, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, with a tolerable safety profile.

A series of PROTACs (PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras) consisting of bicalutamide analogs and thalidomides were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as novel androgen receptor (AR) degraders. In particular, we found that PROTAC compound 13b could successfully demonstrate a targeted degradation of AR in AR-positive cancer cells and might be a useful chemical probe for the investigation of AR-dependent cancer cells, as well as a potential therapeutic candidate for prostate cancers.
A catalytic enantioselective synthesis of bicalutamide derivatives with promising potentials in prostate cancer treatment has been disclosed. The key intermediates, alpha-hydroxy-beta-keto esters, were efficiently constructed through cinchoninium-mediated asymmetric oxohydroxylation of easily accessible alkenes with potassium permanganate. Good yields and high levels of asymmetric induction are achieved. This method provides a new synthetic route to bicalutamide analogues with high structural diversity, which will beneficially support subsequent structure-activity relationship studies and boost prostate cancer drug development.
