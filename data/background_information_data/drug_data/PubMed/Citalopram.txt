Antidepressant medications have an onset of action of several weeks and have moderate efficacy. Their mode of administration is oral (p.o.). Some clinicians wondered whether intravenous (i.v.) administration would speed onset of action and increase efficacy. In this article we review controlled studies on i.v. administration of antidepressants. These include clomipramine, citalopram, and other antidepressants. Overall these studies do not support increased efficacy of i.v. over p.o.administration but there are suggestions of a faster onset of action. In one study i.v. citalopram showed superior response rates over p.o. citalopram (79% vs. 63%) in severely depressed patients at 8 weeks.
Citalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor that has demonstrated antidepressant efficacy in numerous controlled clinical trials. Additional studies have shown that the drug benefits patients with other illnesses that are related in some way to serotonergic dysfunction, including anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, premenstrual dysphoria, alcohol dependence and the behavioural disturbances of dementia. This paper reviews the full spectrum of citalopram's clinical efficacy, as well as its safety and tolerability, in a range of patients.
Citalopram is one of the newer and most potent selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs. It has a well-established antidepressive action with a favorable adverse event profile. We present a fifty-year-old woman with diffuse photopigmentation who had been diagnosed as suffering from depression. The patient was given citalopram (40 mg/day) for her psychiatric condition and diffuse photopigmentation was noted thereafter. To our knowledge, such an adverse event has not been reported previously.
Escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depression. This chapter reviews preclinical and clinical studies with escitalopram, focusing on its therapeutic profile of action and tolerability. Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of the racemic SSRI citalopram. It has been proposed that the S-enantiomer of citalopram is the isomer that holds antidepressant efficacy, and that the R-enantiomer is clinically inactive; preclinical and clinical data support this. Based on in vitro radioligand binding data, escitalopram is the most selective SSRI available. Hypotheses that escitalopram has a more rapid onset of action or fewer adverse effects than citalopram have not yet been fully documented in published studies, although its profile is at least comparable to citalopram. Escitalopram is more effective than placebo in the treatment of major depression and as effective as other SSRIs, including citalopram. Comparable to other SSRIs, it is well tolerated, safe in overdose and has a low incidence of adverse effects or drug interactions.
A variety of medications can induce or enhance a tremor. Tremors most commonly affect the limbs, especially the arms. We report a patient who presented with a 5-6 Hz jaw tremor with a temporal association with the administration of citalopram. To our knowledge, this is the first report in literature, of a transient jaw tremor associated with citalopram. According to the current data, citalopram-induced jaw tremor can be explained by an indirect inhibitory effect on central dopaminergic activity.
