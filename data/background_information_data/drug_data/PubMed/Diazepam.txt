Diazepam and lorazepam differ in potency and in the time-course of their action. As a sedative, diazepam 10 mg is equivalent to lorazepam 2-2.5 mg. Diazepam is better absorbed after oral than after i.m. administrations but this does not apply to lorazepam. The clinical effect and amnesia begin more rapidly with diazepam, but last longer following lorazepam. Lorazepam is more effective than diazepam in blocking the emergence sequelae from ketamine. Lorazepam i.v. is followed by a lesser frequency of venous thrombosis.
Eleven healthy subjects received single oral doses of placebo, 2 mg diazepam, 5 mg diazepam, and 10 mg diazepam in a randomized four-way crossover study. Plasma diazepam levels, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and fraction of total electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude falling in the sigma plus beta (13 to 31 Hz) frequency range were determined during the 12 hours after drug administration. Peak plasma diazepam concentration and area under the 12-hour curve were proportional to dose; time of peak was independent of dose. Baseline percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range averaged 15.7% and did not differ among the four trials. The percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range did not change over baseline with placebo or 2 mg diazepam but was increased 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours after 5 mg diazepam, (maximum, +7.3%) and 3/4 to 12 hours after 10 mg diazepam (maximum, +15.2%). The increase in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range was highly correlated with plasma diazepam concentration. DSST scores for placebo and 2 mg diazepam were nearly identical. DSST decrements with 5 and 10 mg diazepam paralleled and were correlated with the changes in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range and with plasma diazepam levels. Thus the EEG analysis provides objective quantitation of benzodiazepine central nervous system effects, in turn reflecting plasma levels and other clinical measures.
In Ophthalmic practice diazepam is often used a a premedicant. We report a case where administration of diazepam led to a state of acute delirium because of which surgery had to be postponed. The possible mechanisms for this reaction and the treatment is discussed. This side effect of diazepam should be kept in mind while dealing with delirium in the geriatric age group.
Intravenous diazepam rapidly relieved catatonic immobility in two schizophrenic patients, and oral diazepam maintained this therapeutic effect. Diazepam may be an immediately available and effective treatment for some patients with life-threatening catatonic disorders.
Reports of the withdrawal syndrome following discontinuation of diazepam and drug dependence fears have contributed to diazepam's displacement as the most popular anxiolytic agent. Reports of the withdrawal syndrome, the factors involved in withdrawal, and the remedies proposed for diazepam withdrawal symptoms are reviewed.
