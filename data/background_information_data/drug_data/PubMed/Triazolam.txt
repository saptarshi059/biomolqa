This review aims at providing a critical assessment of the effects of the most widely used benzodiazepine (flurazepam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, triazolam) and non-benzodiazepine (zopiclone and zolpidem) hypnotic drugs, based on the recording of polysomnographic variables. In the light of newly acquired neurophysiological data on the microstructure of sleep, this paper reconsiders the problem of insomnia and the current ideas on polysomnography and hypnotic drugs.
Twelve volunteers with a complaint of chronic insomnia participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of the effects of buspirone t.i.d. on sleep pattern and daytime function. The drug was tested alone and in combination with flurazepam or triazolam. Buspirone alone did not impair objective measures of daytime wakefulness or performance. Impaired alertness was seen the day after bedtime administration of flurazepam but not after triazolam; buspirone did not alter these effects. Buspirone did not affect the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, a sensitive measure of changes in daytime alertness.
Triazolam, commonly prescribed to treat insomnia, also can be used to reduce dental anxiety. Despite controversial reports in the lay press, triazolam can be used safely at low doses for short periods. The authors review research concerning the drug's safety and discuss its use in dentistry.
Zalpelon was compared with triazolam for oral sedation in a third molar surgery model using a double-blind crossover design. Factors such as anxiolysis, amnesia, and quality of sedation were assessed. Of the 14 participants who completed the study, zaleplon sedation was found to be similar to triazolam sedation in all regards except that recovery from zaleplon was more rapid.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature that compares zolpidem with triazolam, with an emphasis on efficacy and safety in humans. DATA SOURCES: Information was retrieved from a MEDLINE search (1983-1996) of the English-language literature using the terms triazolam and zolpidem. STUDY SELECTION: Reports of clinical trials comparing the safety and efficacy of zolpidem and triazolam were included in this review. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were evaluated according to study design, efficacy, and adverse effects. Pertinent information was selected and the data synthesized into a review format. DATA SYNTHESIS: Zolpidem and triazolam have similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in humans. Clinical trials have shown that usually recommended, equipotent dosages of zolpidem and triazolam do not differ with respect to pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, residual effects, memory impairment, rebound insomnia, abuse potential, or other adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Zolpidem offers no distinct therapeutic advantage over triazolam for the treatment of insomnia.
