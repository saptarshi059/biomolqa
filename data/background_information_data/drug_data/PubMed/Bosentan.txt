BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bosentan therapy has been recommended for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and might be beneficial for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We aimed to evaluate the specific effects of bosentan for PAH and CTEPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing efficacy and safety of bosentan treatment for PAH and CTEPH through major biomedical database. RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs including 1185 patients were enrolled. For PAH patients, bosentan prolonged 6-minute walk distance with a weighted mean difference of 35.7 m, reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure by 5.7 mm Hg, increased cardiac index by 0.4 L/min/m(2) , reduced pulmonary vascular resistance by 305.1 dyn.s/cm(5) , prevented functional class from deterioration and reduced clinical worsening as compared with placebo. For CTEPH patients, bosentan improved cardiac index by 0.3 L/min/m(2) and reduced pulmonary vascular resistance by 176.0 dyn.s/cm(5) . Other efficacy outcomes regarding CTEPH did not attain statistical difference. For both PAH and CTEPH, there was no significant difference in mortality or adverse event between bosentan and placebo group. However, bosentan raised the risk of abnormal liver function in both PAH and CTEPH patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bosentan is effective in treating PAH, whereas it improves only certain hemodynamic parameters of CTEPH. Incidence of liver function abnormality is higher in bosentan treatment.
BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease in children, with significant mortality. Because of the limited research on pediatric PAH, first, systematic review of related drugs is conducted, and then economic evaluation of PAH drug treatment programs is conducted, which to provide a reference for the choice of more cost-effective treatment options. METHODS: The search includes electronic databases such as Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Embase. Through inclusion and exclusion criteria, screen high-quality randomized controlled trials. We used TreeAge Pro 2011 software to construct the markov model, that to simulate the total medical cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analysis of transfer probability, utility, and cost was carried out. RESULTS: Incorporate two studies that meet the criteria, one compared the therapeutic effects of bosentan and placebo on pediatric PAH, the other compared therapeutic effects of sildenafil and placebo on pediatric PAH, both articles were of good quality. Compared with the sildenafil group (3.38QALYs and $161,120.14), the QALY of the bosentan treatment group (3.33QALYs and $257,411.29) was reduced by 0.05, and the cost increased by $96,291.15. The estimated improvement to quality of life and reduced costs result in an estimate of economic dominance for sildenafil over bosentan. This dominant result persisted probabilistic analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, a more cost-effective treatment drug for PAH in children is sildenafil.
BACKGROUND: The data on bosentan were lacking for the treatment of exercise-induced elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (eePAP) or less severe PH in COPD. This study was conducted to investigate long-term efficacy and safety of bosentan for the treatment of eePAP or less severe PH in COPD. METHODS: COPD patients diagnosed at this hospital as having COPD (WHO functional class II, III or IV) with eePAP or less severe PH whose respiratory symptoms were stable but remained and gradually progressed even after COPD therapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either bosentan or no PH treatment for two years and assessed at baseline and every 6 months for respiratory failure, activities of daily living (ADL), lung and heart functions by right heart catheterization (RHC), and other parameters. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients who underwent RHC for detail examination were enrolled in the current study between August 2010 and October 2018.No death occurred in drug-treated group (n = 14) for 2 years; 5 patients died in untreated group (n = 15). Significant differences were noted between the 2 group in hospital-free survival (686.00 +/- 55.87 days vs. 499.94 +/- 53.27 days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.18; P = 0.026) and overall survival (727 days vs. 516.36 +/- 55.38 days; HR, 0.095; P = 0.030) in all causes of death analysis, but not in overall survival in analysis of respiratory-related death. Bosentan was not associated with increased adverse events including requiring O(2) inhalation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the prognosis for COPD patients with eePAP or less severe PH presenting with respiratory symptoms was very poor and that bosentan tended to improve their prognosis and suppress ADL deterioration without worsening respiratory failure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial as UMIN000004749 . First trial registration at 18/12/2010.
WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Two endothelin receptor antagonists, ambrisentan and bosentan, have been demonstrated to be effective individually compared with placebo in the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This network meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of ambrisentan and bosentan in patients with PAH. METHODS: Clinical trials were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL/CCTR), EMBASE and PubMed databases. Weighted mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes (6-min walk distance [6MWD] and Borg dyspnoea index [BDI]). Hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for binary outcomes, including clinical worsening, discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) and liver dysfunction. Surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to rank the treatments in each index. RESULTS: Five clinical trials from four published studies (total patients: n = 920) were included. Ambrisentan and bosentan showed no significant difference in 6MWD (MD: -1.32; 95% CI: -27.87, 25.31, SUCRA score: ambrisentan 0.73, bosentan 0.77), BDI (MD: -0.16; 95% CI: -0.98, 0.65, SUCRA score: ambrisentan 0.83, bosentan 0.66), clinical worsening (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.33, 2.94, SUCRA score: ambrisentan 0.75, bosentan 0.74) and discontinuation due to AEs (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.11, 5.86, SUCRA score: ambrisentan 0.47, bosentan 0.57). However, ambrisentan was significantly better than bosentan with respect to abnormal liver function (HR: 23.18; 95% CI: 2.24, 377.20, SUCRA score: ambrisentan 0.99, bosentan 0.02). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The results of this network meta-analysis suggest that ambrisentan was similar to bosentan in efficacy, while it exhibited better tolerability with respect to abnormal liver function in comparison with bosentan, in patients with PAH.
Presently described is successful cesarean delivery in a pregnancy superimposed on long-term bosentan treatment in an Eisenmenger syndrome patient with cor triatriatum sinistrum, double-orifice mitral valve, and large ventricular septal defect resulting in single functioning ventricle with double outlets. Cesarean delivery was performed at 27th week of gestation without maternal or fetal morbidity. The infant had no congenital cardiovascular abnormality or any probable teratogenic effect of bosentan treatment during pregnancy.
BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by early vascular abnormalities and subsequent fibroblast activation to myofibroblasts, leading to fibrosis. Recently, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), a complex biological process in which endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire a mesenchymal or myofibroblastic phenotype, has been reported in SSc. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of endothelin-1 (ET-1) dual receptor antagonists bosentan (BOS) and macitentan (MAC) to antagonize EndoMT in vitro. METHODS: Ten women with limited SSc were enrolled. They underwent double skin biopsy (affected and nonaffected skin). Fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) were isolated from biopsies. We performed mono- or coculture of MVECs (isolated from nonaffected skin) with fibroblasts (isolated from affected skin and stimulated with ET-1 and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-beta]). In cocultures, the MVEC layer was left undisturbed or was preincubated with BOS or MAC. After 48 h of coculture, MVECs were analyzed for their tube formation ability and for messenger RNA and protein expression of different vascular (CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor-A [VEGF-A], VEGF-A165b) and profibrotic (alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA], collagen type I [Col I], TGF-beta) molecules. RESULTS: After 48 h, MVECs showed a reduced tube formation ability when cocultured with SSc fibroblasts. CD31 and VEGF-A resulted in downregulation, while VEGF-A165b, the antiangiogenic isoform, resulted in upregulation. At the same time, mesenchymal markers alpha-SMA, Col I, and TGF-beta resulted in overexpression in MVECs. Tube formation ability was restored when MVECs were preincubated with BOS or MAC, also reducing the expression of mesenchymal markers and restoring CD31 expression and the imbalance between VEGF-A and VEGF-A165b. CONCLUSIONS: With this innovative EndoMT in vitro model realized by coculturing nonaffected MVECs with affected SSc fibroblasts, we show that the presence of a myofibroblast phenotype in the fibroblast layer, coupled with an ET-1-TGF-beta synergic effect, is responsible for EndoMT. BOS and MAC seem able to antagonize this phenomenon in vitro, confirming previous evidence of endothelium-derived fibrosis in SSc and possible pharmacological interference.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify if long-term bosentan is an effective and safe treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) regardless of type, including idiopathic PAH (IPAH), and PAH associated with congenital heart disease (APAH-CHD), connective tissue disease (APAH-CTD), and human immunodeficiency virus (APAH-HIV). METHODS: All relevant observations were systematically searched by two independent investigators and obtained from three databases, including PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, from the inception of each database to February 2020. Currently, long-term administration was defined as no less than 12 months. A random-effects or fixed-effects model was selected according to outcomes of the heterogeneity test for meta-analysis, where standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used for continuous outcomes, in addition to the estimated effect (ES; 95% CI) for the synthesized survival rate. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was applied to analyze the differences of efficacy and survivals in each type of PAH cohort. RESULTS: Fifteen studies including a total of 659 subjects undergoing oral bosentan administration for at least 12 months were pooled in this quantitative review. Meta-analysis and subgroup analysis indicated that significant clinical benefits existed, including an improved 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and functional class (FC), in patients with APAH-CHD (6MWD: SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.93, p < 0.0001; functional benefits: 50.4%, 95% CI 43.7-57.1%), APAH-HIV (6MWD: SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.36-1.30, p = 0.001; functional benefits: 80.4%), and IPAH (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.28-0.80, p < 0.0001; functional benefits: 61.4%, 95% CI 54.2-68.5%), but a non-significant change in APAH-CTD (6MWD: SMD 0.18, 95% CI - 0.60 to 0.95, p = 0.656; functional benefits: 27.5%). Furthermore, among the hemodynamic parameters, long-term bosentan led to a significant decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (SMD - 0.86, p < 0.0001) in APAH-CTD, and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (SMD - 0.65, p < 0.0001) and elevated oxygen saturation (SMD 0.30, p = 0.006) in APAH-CHD. Importantly, in all pooled studies, the overall survival indicated 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates of 94.3%, 88.8%, and 81.7%, respectively, in all-cause PAH, and subgroup analysis demonstrated a relative decreasing trend in patients with HIV, from a 2-year survival of 89.8% to a 3-year survival of 66.1%. Adverse drug reactions were relatively mild. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, long-term administration of oral bosentan has been identified as a well-tolerated and effective agent in different types of PAH. In addition, we conclude that long-term oral bosentan should be considered for patients with CTD to achieve a satisfactory exercise capacity, and for those with APAH-HIV to improve survivals, where more attention on adverse events is required.
We report a case of a seven-yr-old girl with a PAH treated with continuation therapy of bosentan and sildenafil. The combination therapy revealed safety and efficacy in long-term follow up.
Endothelin receptors (ETRs) have crucial roles in vascular control and are targets for drugs designed to treat circulatory-system diseases and cancer progression. The nonpeptide dual-ETR antagonist bosentan is the first oral drug approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Here we report crystal structures of human endothelin ET(B) receptor bound to bosentan and to the ET(B)-selective analog K-8794, at 3.6-A and 2.2-A resolution, respectively. The K-8794-bound structure reveals the detailed water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network at the transmembrane core, which could account for the weak negative allosteric modulation of ET(B) by Na(+) ions. The bosentan-bound structure reveals detailed interactions with ET(B), which are probably conserved in the ET(A) receptor. A comparison of the two structures shows unexpected similarity between antagonist and agonist binding. Despite this similarity, bosentan sterically prevents the inward movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), and thus exerts its antagonistic activity. These structural insights will facilitate the rational design of new ETR-targeting drugs.
BACKGROUND: Macitentan is an orally active, potent, dual endothelin receptor antagonist and is the only registered treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension that significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in a long-term study. AIM: We have recently reported that switch from bosentan to macitentan significantly improved exercise capacity in children and young adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension in a 24-week prospective study and well tolerated without adverse events. We now aimed to evaluate clinical efficacy, safety of switch in a larger patient population, in a 24-month prospective study. METHODS: This is a single-institution, 24-month prospective study. Patients >/=12 years with idiopathic/heritable, pulmonary arterial hypertension, or related to CHD or residual pulmonary arterial hypertension due to repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and on bosentan treatment were included. Concomitant treatment with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors/inhaled prostanoids was allowed. Outcome measures included change from baseline to 24 months, in the 6-minute walk distance, functional class, oxygen saturation at rest/after walk distance test, and natriuretic peptide levels. Safety end points included adverse events, laboratory abnormalities. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (19 adults/8 children, mean age: 21.1 +/- 6.3 years (12-36), weight: 53.1 +/- 15.7 kgs (26-87)) were included. Mean duration of macitentan treatment: 22.3 +/- 3.9 months (9-24). Six-minute walk distance significantly improved from baseline (mean: 458 +/- 79 m (300-620)) at 6 months (mean: 501 +/- 73 m (325-616) + 43 m) (p < 0.05), at 12 months (mean: 514 +/- 82 m (330-626) + 56 m) (p < 0.05), and at 24 months (mean: 532 +/- 85 m (330-682) + 74 m) (p < 0.05). We observed a significant improvement during the first 6 months but no incremental improvement after 6 months (p > 0.05). Macitentan did not significantly change functional class, oxygen saturation, and natriuretic levels (p > 0.05). None of the patients had anaemia, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral edema. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first study which showed that switch from bosentan to macitentan improved exercise capacity in children and young adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension significantly in the first 6 months and compared to baseline in 24 months and well tolerated without adverse events.
BACKGROUND: Tadalafil 40 mg orally once daily, was shown to be well-tolerated and efficacious for pulmonary arterial hypertension in a 16-week, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial. Inclusion criteria included the option for background bosentan. Analyses of tadalafil in treatment-naive patients and as add-on to bosentan were pre-specified. Objectives were to provide safety and efficacy data for both groups. METHODS: Groups analyzed included: treatment-naive + PBO; treatment-naive + tadalafil; background bosentan + PBO; and background bosentan + tadalafil. Patients randomized to tadalafil or PBO (N = 405) were analyzed by bosentan use (yes = 216, no = 189). Treatment differences in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD, PBO-adjusted), functional class (FC), clinical worsening (CW) and adverse events were assessed. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented for FC and CW. RESULTS: At Week 16, PBO-adjusted 6MWD increases were 44 m (CI: 20 to 69 m; n = 37) for tadalafil 40 mg in treatment-naive patients and 23 m (CI: -2 to 48 m; n = 42) for tadalafil 40 mg add-on to bosentan. The 6MWD for treatment-naive and background bosentan PBO patients decreased by 3 m and increased by 19 m, respectively, at Week 16 compared with baseline. Two (5%) treatment-naive patients had CW with tadalafil 40 mg vs 8 (22%) with PBO (HR = 3.3, CI: 1.1 to 10.0). Two (5%) background bosentan patients had CW with tadalafil 40 mg add-on vs 5 (11%) for PBO add-on (HR = 1.9, CI: 0.4 to 10.2). Adverse events for tadalafil monotherapy and as add-on were similar. CONCLUSION: Tadalafil 40 mg was well-tolerated and provided clinical benefit in patients as monotherapy. It was also well-tolerated when added to background bosentan, but data are insufficient to conclude additional benefit.
BACKGROUND: Macitentan is an orally active, potent, dual endothelin receptor antagonist and is the only registered treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension that significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in a long-term event-driven study. Aim Few studies compared the clinical efficacy and safety of switch from bosentan to macitentan only in adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of switch from bosentan to macitentan in children and young adults. METHODS: This is a single-institution, 24-week prospective study. Patients ⩾12 years of age with idiopathic/heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension or related to CHD or residual pulmonary arterial hypertension due to repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and on bosentan therapy were included. Concomitant treatment with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and inhaled prostanoids was allowed. Outcome measures included change from baseline to week 24, in the 6-minute walk distance, functional class, oxygen saturation at rest/after 6-minute walk distance test, systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated by echocardiography, and brain natriuretic peptide levels. Safety end points included adverse events laboratory abnormalities. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients - 5 male and 8 female - completed the study. The mean age was 20.3+/-6.5 years (12-35) and weight was 54.0+/-14.5 kg (27-75). Five patients were ⩽18 years of age. Macitentan improved 6-minute walk distance from baseline (mean: 466+/-35 m (300-590)), at 12 weeks (mean: 494+/-78 m (325-590), +28 m) (p0.05). None of the patients had anaemia, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral oedema. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first study that showed that switch from bosentan to macitentan significantly improved exercise capacity in children and young adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension and is well tolerated without any adverse events.
AIMS: The present study was conducted to characterize the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and to investigate a possible pharmacokinetic interaction with ketoconazole. METHODS: In a randomized, two-way crossover study, 10 healthy male subjects received treatments A and B. Treatment A consisted of a single dose of 62.5 mg bosentan on day 1 followed by 62.5 mg twice daily for 5.5 days. Treatment B consisted of bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily) for 5.5 days plus concomitant ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) for 6 days. Plasma concentrations of bosentan and its three metabolites were measured on days 1 and 7 of treatment A and on day 6 of treatment B. RESULTS: Bosentan was absorbed and eliminated with a tmax of 4.5 h (range 3.5-6.0 h) and a t(1/2) of 5.4 h (95% CI; 4.5, 6.6). Upon multiple dosing, the exposure to bosentan was reduced by 33% without change in tmax and t(1/2). Concomitant administration of ketoconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of bosentan 2.1- (95% CI; 1.5, 2.7) and 2.3-fold (95% CI; 1.8, 2.9), respectively. Exposure to the metabolites was low and represented less than 25% of that to bosentan both after single and multiple doses. In the presence of ketoconazole, formation of the metabolites was inhibited. DISCUSSION: The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of bosentan are consistent with the phenomenon of auto-induction. In the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors, bosentan concentrations may be increased 2-fold.
Renal hemodynamics and pharmacokinetics of bosentan with and without cyclosporine A. BACKGROUND: Endothelins may play an important role in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced renal vasoconstriction. Therefore, the effects of a mixed endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, bosentan (BO), on CsA were studied. METHODS: BO was given either alone or combined with CsA to healthy subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Standardized renal hemodynamics took place after a single dose of BO or placebo and after seven days of regular intake of CsA + BO or CsA + placebo. CsA was administered as a dose-adjusted regimen to achieve predetermined target trough levels. A pharmacokinetic study of CsA and BO was performed. RESULTS: A single dose of BO did not affect renal hemodynamics. After seven days of coadministration with CsA, BO significantly attenuated both the overall CsA-induced fall of renal plasma flow (RPF; placebo, 594 +/- 85; CsA + placebo, 490 +/- 93; CsA + BO, 570 +/- 106* mL/min, *P < 0.01) and the maximal RPF fall (P < 0.01) observed five hours after CsA intake. The CsA-induced rise of blood pressure and the decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were not influenced by comedication with BO. After seven days of CsA + BO, the area under the curve (AUC) of BO was nearly doubled compared with the AUC after a single dose of BO (P < 0.05). To reach the CsA target trough levels after seven days, the average CsA dose was increased by 35% when given with BO, as compared with placebo (P = 0.01). CsA exposure (trough levels, AUC) was not statistically different after CsA + placebo and after CsA + BO. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming CsA nephrotoxicity is mainly due to vasoconstriction, BO has the potential to attenuate the CsA renal toxicity by markedly blunting the renal hypoperfusion effect of CsA. A complex drug interaction between BO and CsA was observed.
The aim of this study was to evaluate in systemic sclerosis (SSc) retrospectively the effect of Bosentan and Sildenafil and their combination on Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), function, and capillaroscopic patterns. One hundred and twenty-three SSc patients (mean age +/- sd, 57.69 +/- 14.07 years) were retrospectively evaluated and divided into two groups according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification score: group 1 score < 10, group 2 score > 10. Each group was divided into three subgroups according to treatment: Bosentan, Sildenafil, and Bosentan + Sildenafil. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC), Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) and Raynaud Condition Score (RCS) were performed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. In Bosentan (29 patients: 12, group 1; 17, group 2), NVC changed significantly in both groups, after 3 and 6 months (p = 0.00439, group 1; p = 0.00035, group 2). In group 1, the "active" and the "late" patterns reduced, and the "aspecific" increased. In group 2, there was a reduction of late patterns, a worsening of SHAQ (p < 0.005) and an improvement of RCS (p = 0.00014). In Sildenafil (63 patients: 35, group 1; 28, group 2), after 3 months, NVC patterns changed significantly in both groups(p = 0.042 group 1, p = 0.00089 group 2). In group 1, the late and early patterns increased, and the aspecific decreased. In group 2, a significant change of NVC pattern was observed also after 6 months (p = 0.00089): the late pattern increased while the active one reduced. After 6 months, SHAQ was significantly reduced in group 1 (p = 0.00027) and in group 2 (p = 0.0043). RCS improved in both groups (p = 0.0042, group 1; p = 0.0016, group 2). Combination therapy (Bosentan + Sildenafil) (31 patients: 14, group 1; 17, group 2) induced significant changes on NVC only in group 1 after 3 (p = 0.00256) and 6 months (p = 0.000349) with a reduction of the late and active patterns and an increase of the early pattern. In both groups, after 6 months, SHAQ (p < 0.05, group 1; p = 0.00049, group 2) and RCS significantly reduced (group 1, p = 0.00024; group 2, p = 0.0021). Patients treated with Bosentan + Sildenafil show a significant improvement of RCS and NVC. This combination therapy may exert a vascular activity achieving an amelioration of the structure of microvasculature in SSc.
