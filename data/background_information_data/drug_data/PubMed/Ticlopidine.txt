Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare complication of ticlopidine treatment. This syndrome has been reported to occur typically within the first few weeks after the initiation of therapy. The authors describe a case of a 72-year-old woman in whom thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura developed just 2 days after starting ticlopidine therapy for a new-onset ischemic stroke. The patient responded successfully to plasmapheresis. The authors are reporting this case to emphasize the unpredictable nature of the association between the drug and the disease, which necessitates careful hematologic monitoring.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) occurs in association with a wide variety of disorders including infections, connective tissue diseases, and solid organ tumors. It also may coincide with administration of drugs such as mitomycin, metronidazole, oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, and many others. We report the occurrence of TTP in a patient shortly after the initiation of ticlopidine.
Fifty-one men with atherosclerotic intermittent claudication and haemorheological abnormalities completed a double-blind, one-year randomised trial of Ticlopidine (500 mg/day), a new antiplatelet agent. Ticlopidine caused significant inhibition of platelet aggregation but did not fully correct abnormalities of coagulation, viscosity, and fibrinolysis. There was no significant improvement in walking ability, Doppler ankle-pressure indices, or calf blood flow. Sustained platelet inhibition for 12 months was insufficient to correct the prothrombotic abnormality of extensive atherosclerosis.
BACKGROUND: Because of its side-effects, long-term administration of ticlopidine limits the use of the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in Japan. METHODS AND RESULTS: Side-effects of ticlopidine occurred in 41 (9.3%) of 440 patients who underwent SES implantation. The majority were liver dysfunction (4.5%) and rash (3.6%). One patient died from severe liver dysfunction. Neutropenia occurred in 3 patients (0.7%). It is remarkable that 28% of side-effects occurred >8 weeks after the initiation of ticlopidine. CONCLUSIONS: Ticlopidine has a relative high rate of side-effects. Clopidogrel should be approved for prevention of stent thrombosis as soon as possible.
The antithrombotic prodrugs ticlopidine and clopidogrel are thienotetrahydro-pyridine derivatives that are metabolized in the liver to produce thiols that irreversibly block adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-activated P2Y(12) receptors on thrombocytes. In their native, nonmetabolized form, both drugs were reported to act as inhibitors of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1, CD39). CD39 catalyzes the extracellular hydrolysis of nucleoside tri- and diphosphates, mainly adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and ADP, yielding adenosine monophosphate, which is further hydrolyzed by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) to produce adenosine. While ATP has proinflammatory effects, adenosine is a potent anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive agent. Inhibitors of CD39 and CD73 have potential as novel checkpoint inhibitors for the immunotherapy of cancer and infection. In the present study, we investigated 2-substituted thienotetrahydropyridine derivatives, structurally related to ticlopidine, as CD39 inhibitors. Due to their substituent on the 2-position, they will not be metabolically transformed into reactive thiols and can, therefore, be expected to be devoid of P2Y(12) receptor-antagonistic activity in vivo. Several of the investigated 2-substituted thienotetrahydropyridine derivatives showed concentration-dependent inhibition of CD39. The most potent derivative, 32, showed similar CD39-inhibitory potency to ticlopidine, both acting as allosteric inhibitors. Compound 32 showed an improved selectivity profile: While ticlopidine blocked several NTPDase isoenzymes, 32 was characterized as a novel dual inhibitor of CD39 and CD73.
