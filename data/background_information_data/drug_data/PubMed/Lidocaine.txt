Lidocaine has analgesic effect and antihyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, which enable its use as a general anesthetic adjuvant. Lidocaine can reduce nociception and/or cardiovascular responses to surgical stress, postoperative pain, and/or analgesic requirements. However, its mechanisms of action remain unclear, despite its different known properties. Although the exact mechanism of action remains uncertain, initial bolus followed by a continuous lidocaine infusion has clear analgesic benefits. Lidocaine is one of the major drugs for opioid-reduced anesthesia or opioid-free anesthesia procedures. It clearly improves the postoperative outcomes with increased patient satisfaction. Such procedures should be included wisely in the enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. By using the recommended protocols, a high safety and efficacy of lidocaine can be achieved.
The clinical efficacy, interventional ease of use, workload implications, and cost-effectiveness of using needle-free lidocaine for procedural pain management were examined in the pediatric acute care setting. The data from the four studies evaluated indicate that needle-free lidocaine significantly reduces procedural pain and is a cost-effective alternative to the use of topical lidocaine.
Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers. The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of bradyarrhythmias; and, thus, this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to lidocaine.
In a few uncontrolled studies intravenous lidocaine has been used in the treatment of chronic pain. In a controlled study we used intravenous lidocaine in 18 patients with severe chronic pain states due to various but mainly neurological diseases. After the infusion of lidocaine 14 patients (78%) had significant pain relief ranging from 2 hours to 25 days. There was no significant effect of placebo infusion with isotonic saline. The mechanism of the pain relieving ability of intravenous lidocaine is unknown.
BACKGROUND: Lidocaine, an amide anesthetic, has been used in the treatment of a wide variety of pain disorders for over 75 years. In addition to pain control, lidocaine is an anti-arrhythmic agent and has anti-inflammatory properties. Lidocaine's unique properties, including nonlinear pharmacokinetics, have limited its modern-day use. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to offer a better understanding of the properties of this unique treatment, which we hope will allow more practitioners to offer this to their patients. METHODS: An analysis of the history, pharmacokinetics, and relevant uses of lidocaine in headache medicine based on a synthesis of the medical literature and clinical experience. RESULTS: Lidocaine is an amide anesthetic that inhibits voltage gated sodium channels, and lidocaine metabolism occurs exclusively in the liver. One lidocaine metabolite has its own unique properties and may be an active form of the drug. CONCLUSION: Open label and retrospective studies have investigated the use of lidocaine in many headache disorders, primarily via injection or infusion. Further research into the active metabolite of lidocaine may allow for its use as a novel nonopiate treatment of chronic pain.
