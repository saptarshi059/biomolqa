BACKGROUND: WHO guidelines recommend dolutegravir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for second-line HIV therapy, with NRTI switching from first-line tenofovir to zidovudine. We aimed to examine whether dolutegravir is non-inferior to darunavir, the best-in-class protease inhibitor drug, and whether maintaining tenofovir in second-line therapy is non-inferior to switching to zidovudine. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, open-label, factorial, randomised, non-inferiority trial (NADIA), participants with confirmed HIV first-line treatment failure (HIV-1 RNA >/=1000 copies per mL) were recruited at seven clinical sites in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Following a 2 x 2 factorial design and stratified by site and screening HIV-1 RNA concentration, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive a 96-week regimen containing either dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) or ritonavir-boosted darunavir (800 mg of darunavir plus 100 mg of ritonavir once daily) in combination with either tenofovir (300 mg once daily) plus lamivudine (300 mg once daily) or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) plus lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). The NRTI drugs allocated by randomisation were administered orally in fixed-dose combination pills; other drugs were administered orally as separate pills. The previously reported primary outcome was the proportion of participants with a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 400 copies per mL at 48 weeks. Here, we report the main secondary outcome: the proportion of participants with a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 400 copies per mL at 96 weeks (non-inferiority margin 12%). We analysed this outcome and safety outcomes in the intention-to-treat population, which excluded only those who were randomly assigned in error and withdrawn before receiving trial drugs. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03988452, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between July 30 and Dec 18, 2019, we screened 783 patients and enrolled 465. One participant was randomly assigned in error and immediately withdrawn. The remaining 464 participants were randomly assigned to receive either dolutegravir (n=235) or ritonavir-boosted darunavir (n=229) and to receive lamivudine plus either tenofovir (n=233) or zidovudine (n=231). At week 96, 211 (90%) of 235 participants in the dolutegravir group and 199 (87%) of 229 participants in the darunavir group had HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (percentage point difference 2.9, 95% CI -3.0 to 8.7), indicating non-inferiority. Nine (4%) participants (all in the dolutegravir group) developed dolutegravir resistance; no participants developed darunavir resistance (p=0.0023). In the other randomised comparison, 214 (92%) of 233 patients in the tenofovir group and 196 (85%) of 231 patients in the zidovudine group had HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL (percentage point difference 7.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 12.8), showing non-inferiority and indicating the superiority of tenofovir (p=0.019). The proportions of participants with any grade 3-4 adverse event were similar between the dolutegravir (26 [11%]) and darunavir (28 [12%]) groups and between the tenofovir (22 [9%]) and zidovudine (32 [14%]) groups. There were no deaths related to study medication. INTERPRETATION: Dolutegravir-based and darunavir-based regimens maintain good viral suppression during 96 weeks; dolutegravir is non-inferior to darunavir but is at greater risk of resistance in second-line therapy. Tenofovir should be continued in second-line therapy, rather than being switched to zidovudine. FUNDING: Janssen.
BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine and darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir has been suggested as an approach to improve the outcome of patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES: To examine the safety of combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine and darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia treated with hydroxychloroquine and darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. Clinical evaluations, electrocardiograms and the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine, darunavir and lopinavir were examined according to clinical practice and guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received hydroxychloroquine with lopinavir/ritonavir (median age 68 years; 10 males) and 25 received hydroxychloroquine with darunavir/ritonavir (median age 71 years; 15 males). During treatment, eight patients (17.4%) developed ECG abnormalities. Ten patients discontinued treatment, including seven for ECG abnormalities a median of 5 (range 2-6) days after starting treatment. All ECG abnormalities reversed 1-2 days after interrupting treatment. Four patients died within 14 days. ECG abnormalities were significantly associated with age over 70 years, coexisting conditions (such as hypertension, chronic cardiovascular disease and kidney failure) and initial potential drug interactions, but not with the hydroxychloroquine concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Of the patients with COVID-19 who received hydroxychloroquine with lopinavir or darunavir, 17% had ECG abnormalities, mainly related to age or in those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends dolutegravir with two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for second-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Evidence is limited for the efficacy of this regimen when NRTIs are predicted to lack activity because of drug resistance, as well as for the recommended switch of an NRTI from tenofovir to zidovudine. METHODS: In a two-by-two factorial, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients for whom first-line therapy was failing (HIV-1 viral load, >/=1000 copies per milliliter) to receive dolutegravir or ritonavir-boosted darunavir and to receive tenofovir or zidovudine; all patients received lamivudine. The primary outcome was a week 48 viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter, assessed with the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm (noninferiority margin for the between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the primary outcome, 12 percentage points). RESULTS: We enrolled 464 patients at seven sub-Saharan African sites. A week 48 viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter was observed in 90.2% of the patients in the dolutegravir group (212 of 235) and in 91.7% of those in the darunavir group (210 of 229) (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.7 to 3.7; P = 0.58; indicating noninferiority of dolutegravir, without superiority) and in 92.3% of the patients in the tenofovir group (215 of 233) and in 89.6% of those in the zidovudine group (207 of 231) (difference, 2.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.6 to 7.9; P = 0.32; indicating noninferiority of tenofovir, without superiority). In the subgroup of patients with no NRTIs that were predicted to have activity, a viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter was observed in more than 90% of the patients in the dolutegravir group and the darunavir group. The incidence of adverse events did not differ substantially between the groups in either factorial comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Dolutegravir in combination with NRTIs was effective in treating patients with HIV-1 infection, including those with extensive NRTI resistance in whom no NRTIs were predicted to have activity. Tenofovir was noninferior to zidovudine as second-line therapy. (Funded by Janssen; NADIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03988452.).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of etravirine on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/cobicistat and vice versa. Safety and tolerability of this combination were also evaluated. METHODS: Open-label, fixed-sequence trial in two cohorts of HIV-infected patients on therapy with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily (DRV cohort; n = 15) or etravirine 400 mg once daily (ETR cohort; n = 15). Etravirine or darunavir/cobicistat were added on days 1-14 and 1-7 in participants in the DRV or ETR cohort, respectively. Full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained on days 0 and 14 in the DRV cohort, and on days 0 and 7 in the ETR cohort. Darunavir, cobicistat and etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters [AUC0-24, Cmax and trough concentrations in plasma (C24)] were calculated for each individual by non-compartmental analysis and were compared using linear mixed-effects models. Adverse events and HIV-1 RNA in plasma were monitored. RESULTS: Etravirine co-administration decreased cobicistat AUC0-24, Cmax and C24 by 30%, 14% and 66%, respectively. Although darunavir AUC0-24 and Cmax were unchanged by etravirine, darunavir C24 was 56% lower for darunavir/cobicistat co-administered with etravirine relative to darunavir/cobicistat alone. Etravirine pharmacokinetics were unchanged by darunavir/cobicistat. Treatments were well tolerated, and HIV-1 RNA remained undetectable in all participants. CONCLUSIONS: Although etravirine pharmacokinetics was unchanged by darunavir/cobicistat, there was a significant decrease in cobicistat exposure and in darunavir C24 when darunavir/cobicistat was co-administered with etravirine. Boosting darunavir with ritonavir instead of with cobicistat may be preferred if darunavir is to be combined with etravirine in clinical practice.
Treatment of HIV-infected patients coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is challenging due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between antiretrovirals (ARVs) and antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of cobicistat (COBI) or ritonavir (RTV) in modulating DDIs between darunavir (DRV) and rifampin (RIF) in a human hepatocyte-based in vitro model. Human primary hepatocyte cultures were incubated with RIF alone or in combination with either COBI or RTV for 3 days, followed by coincubation with DRV for 1 h. The resultant DRV concentrations were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, and the apparent intrinsic clearance (CL(int.app.)) of DRV was calculated. Both RTV and COBI lowered the RIF-induced increases in CL(int.app.) in a concentration-dependent manner. Linear regression analysis showed that log(10) RTV and log(10) COBI concentrations were associated with the percent inhibition of RIF-induced elevations in DRV CL(int.app.), where beta was equal to -234 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -275 to -193; P < 0.0001) and -73 (95% CI = -89 to -57; P < 0.0001), respectively. RTV was more effective in lowering 10 muM RIF-induced elevations in DRV CL(int.app.) (half-maximal [50%] inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.025 muM) than COBI (IC(50) = 0.223 muM). Incubation of either RTV or COBI in combination with RIF was sufficient to overcome RIF-induced elevations in DRV CL(int.app.), with RTV being more potent than COBI. These data provide the first in vitro experimental insight into DDIs between RIF and COBI-boosted or RTV-boosted DRV and will be useful to inform physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to aid in optimizing dosing regimens for the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and M. tuberculosis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate darunavir and cobicistat pharmacokinetics during pregnancy compared with postpartum and in infant washout samples after delivery. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter phase-IV prospective study of darunavir and cobicistat pharmacokinetics in pregnant women with HIV and their children in the United States. METHODS: Intensive steady-state 24-h pharmacokinetic profiles were performed after administration of 800 mg of darunavir and 150 mg of cobicistat orally in fixed dose combination once-daily during the second trimester, third trimester, and postpartum. Infant washout samples were collected after birth. Darunavir and cobicistat were measured in plasma by validated HPLC-UV and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS)/MS assays, respectively. A two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test (alpha = 0.10) was employed for paired within-participant comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 29 pregnant women receiving darunavir and cobicistat once-daily enrolled in the study. Compared with paired postpartum data, darunavir AUC0--24 was 53% lower in the second trimester [n = 12, P = 0.0024, geometric mean of ratio (GMR)=0.47, 90% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 - 0.68] and 56% lower in the third trimester (n = 18, P < 0.0001, GMR = 0.44, 90% CI 0.36 - 0.54), whereas cobicistat AUC0--24 was 50% lower in the second trimester (n = 12, P = 0.0024, GMR = 0.50, 90% CI 0.36-0.69) and 56% lower in the third trimester (n = 18, P < 0.0001, GMR = 0.44, 90% CI 0.35-0.55). Placental transfer of darunavir and cobicistat was limited. CONCLUSION: Standard darunavir/cobicistat dosing during pregnancy results in significantly lower exposure during pregnancy, which may increase the risk of virologic failure and perinatal transmission.
BACKGROUND: Once-weekly isoniazid with rifapentine (HP) for 3 months is a recommended treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in persons with HIV. HP reduces exposures of certain antiretroviral medications, resulting in limited options for the concomitant use of these therapies. Here, we examined the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of darunavir/cobicistat with HP. METHODS: This was an open-label, fixed sequence, two-period crossover study in persons without HIV. Participants received darunavir 800 mg/cobicistat 150 mg once-daily alone for 4 days, then continued darunavir/cobicistat once-daily for days 5-19 with HP coadministration on days 5, 12, and 19. Intensive PK assessments were performed on days 4, 14, and 19. PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. Geometric mean ratios with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and compared between phases using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Thirteen participants were enrolled. Two withdrew after day 4, and one withdrew after day 14. Of the 3 withdrawals, 2 were attributed to drug-related adverse events. Darunavir area under the concentration-time curve, maximum concentrations (Cmax), and concentrations at 24 hours postdose (C24h) were reduced by 71%, 41%, and 96%  approximately 48-72 hours after HP administration (day 14), respectively, and 36%, 17%, and 89% with simultaneous HP administration (day 19), respectively. On day 14, 45% of the predose and 73% of C24h concentrations were below the darunavir EC50 (0.055 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Darunavir exposures were significantly decreased with HP coadministration. Temporal relationships between HP coadministration and the extent of induction or mixed inhibition/induction of darunavir metabolism were apparent. Coadministration of darunavir/cobicistat with 3HP should be avoided.
There is an ongoing debate regarding whether low-level viremia (LLV), in particular persistent LLV, during HIV treatment with optimal adherence originates from low-level viral replication, viral production, or both. We performed an observational study in 30 individuals with LLV who switched to a boosted darunavir (DRV)-based therapy. In-depth virological analyses were used to characterize the viral population and the (activity) of the viral reservoir. Immune activation was examined using cell-bound and soluble markers. The primary outcome was defined as the effect on HIV-RNA and was categorized by responders (<50 cp/mL) or non-responders (>50 cp/mL). At week 24, 53% of the individuals were considered responders, 40% non-responders, and 7% could not be assigned. Sequencing showed no evolution or selection of drug resistance in the non-responders. Production of defective virus with mutations in either the protease (D25N) or RT active site contributed to persistent LLV in two individuals. We show that in about half of the study participants, the switch to a DRV-based regimen resulted in a viral response indicative of ongoing low-level viral replication as the cause of LLV before the switch. Our data confirm that in clinical management, high genetic barrier drugs like DRV are a safe choice, irrespective of the source of LLV.
Darunavir is a nonpeptidic protease inhibitor recently approved for the treatment of antiretroviral therapy-experienced patients. It has potent in vitro activity against viral isolates that are resistant to currently licensed protease inhibitors. In randomized clinical trials with optimized background regimens, it has shown virologic and immunologic responses superior to comparator-based regimens.
AIMS: Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy reduces inflammation and immune activation in people with HIV, but not down to the levels observed in people without HIV. Limited drug penetration within tissues has been argued as a potential mechanism of persistent inflammation. Data on the inflammation role on ARV plasma/intracellular (IC) pharmacokinetics (PK) through to expression of cytochrome P450 3A/membrane transporters are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between inflammation markers (IM) and plasma/IC PK of ARV regimen in HIV-positive patients. METHODS: We included ART-experienced patients switching to three different ARV regimens. Plasma and IC ARV drug concentration means at the end of dosing interval (T(0) ), IM on samples concomitantly with ARV PK determination: sCD14, CRP, IL-6 and LPS were analysed. RESULTS: Plasma and IC drug concentrations were measured in 60 samples. No significative differences between CRP, sCD14, IL-6 and LPS values in the three arms were observed. A significant inverse correlation between tenofovir plasma concentration and sCD14 (rho = -0.79, P < .001), and between DRV IC/plasma ratio and Log(10) IL-6 concentrations (rho = -0.36, P = .040), and a borderline statistically significant positive trend between DRV plasma concentration and sCD14 (rho = 0.31, P = .070) were suggested. Furthermore, a borderline statistically significant inverse trend between DTG IC concentrations and sCD14 (rho = -0.34, P = .090) was observed in 24 patients on DTG-based triple therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data support the hypothesis of lower DRV and DTG IC concentrations and lower TFV plasma exposure in patients with higher plasma IM suggesting an interplay between HIV drug penetration and persistent inflammation in cART-treated HIV-positive patients.
BACKGROUND: Since limited data are available, we aimed to compare the efficacy and durability of dolutegravir and darunavir in advanced naive patients. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study including AIDS- or late-presenting (def. CD4 </= 200/microL) HIV-infected patients starting dolutegravir or ritonavir/cobicistat-boosted darunavir+2NRTIs. Patients were followed from the date of first-line therapy initiation (baseline, BL) to the discontinuation of darunavir or dolutegravir, or for a maximum of 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall 308 patients (79.2% males, median age 43 years, 40.3% AIDS-presenters, median CD4 66 cells/microL) were enrolled; 181 (58.8%) and 127 (41.2%) were treated with dolutegravir and darunavir, respectively. Incidence of treatment discontinuation (TD), virological failure (VF, defined as a single HIV-RNA > 1000 cp/mL or two consecutive HIV-RNA > 50 cp/mL after 6 months of therapy or after virological suppression had been achieved), treatment failure (the first of TD or VF), and optimal immunological recovery (defined as CD4 >/= 500/microL + CD4 >/= 30% + CD4/CD8 >/= 1) were 21.9, 5.2, 25.6 and 1.4 per 100 person-years of follow-up, respectively, without significant differences between dolutegravir and darunavir (p > 0.05 for all outcomes). However, a higher estimated probability of TD for central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (at 36 months: 11.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) was observed for dolutegravir, whereas darunavir showed a higher probability of TD for simplification (at 36 months: 21.3% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Dolutegravir and darunavir showed similar efficacy in AIDS- and late-presenting patients. A higher risk of TD due to CNS toxicity was observed with dolutegravir, and a higher probability of treatment simplification with darunavir.
BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with gain in quantity of fat and muscle, but the impact on quality is less understood. The objective of this study was to compare fat and muscle density among people with HIV (PWH) on stable raltegravir (RAL), atazanavir with ritonavir (ATV/r), or darunavir with ritonavir (DRV/r), and explore implications on muscle function. METHODS: Participants from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic taking RAL, ATV/r, or DRV/r with at least 1 computed tomography (CT) scan were included. CT scans were reanalyzed for area and density of truncal fat and musculature. Multivariate models explored the effect of ART on fat and muscle density. RESULTS: One hundred six participants were receiving ATV/r, 48 DRV/r, and 141 RAL. In multivariate models (reference ATV/r), only DRV/r was associated with greater subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area, lower lateralis muscle density (more fat), and greater lateralis intermuscular fat area. Compared to ATV/r, RAL was independently associated with less psoas intermuscular fat area. Among all, greater paraspinal muscle density correlated with better physical function. No associations between ART group and physical function were seen among men; DRV/r was associated with stronger grip strength among women. CONCLUSION: DRV/r was associated with greater fat area and lower density of both fat and muscle, and RAL with less intermuscular psoas fat. Higher density psoas and paraspinal musculature were associated with better physical function, suggesting potential clinical relevance of these findings.
OBJECTIVE: The DUALIS study showed that switching to boosted darunavir (bDRV) plus dolutegravir (DTG; 2DR) was non-inferior to continuous bDRV plus 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; 3DR) in treatment-experienced virologically suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH). We analyzed virologic outcomes with respect to treatment history and HIV drug resistance. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of a randomized trial. METHODS: Main inclusion criteria were an HIV RNA level < 50 copies/mL for >/= 24 weeks and no resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors or bDRV. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were interpreted using the Stanford HIVdb mutation list. Outcomes measures were 48-week virologic response (HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL, FDA snapshot) and HIV RNA >/= 50 copies/mL (including discontinuation due to a lack of efficacy or reasons other than adverse events and HIV RNA >/= 50 copies/mL, referred to as snapshot non-response). RESULTS: The analysis population included 263 patients (2DR: 131, 3DR: 132): 90.1% males; median age, 48 years; CD4 + T-cell nadir < 200/microl, 47.0%; >/= 2 treatment changes, 27.4%; NRTI, non-NRTI (NNRTI), and major protease inhibitor (PI) RAMs in 9.5%, 14.4%, and 3.4%, respectively. In patients with RAMs in the 2DR and 3DR groups, virologic response rates were 87.8% and 96.0%, respectively; the corresponding rates in those without RAMs were 85.7% and 81.8%. RAMs were unrelated to virologic non-response in either group. No treatment-emergent RAMs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: DTG + bDRV is an effective treatment option without the risk of treatment-emergent resistance for PLWH on suppressive first- or further-line treatment with or without evidence of pre-existing NRTI, NNRTI, or PI RAMs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EUDRA-CT Number 2015-000360-34; registered 07 April 2015; https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2015-000360-34/DE .
BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic data are lacking for progestin-releasing subdermal contraceptive implants when used with either rilpivirine- or darunavir/ritonavir-based ART. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel implants when administered with these ART regimens over 48 weeks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two separate, parallel, three-group, non-randomized, pharmacokinetic studies evaluated either etonogestrel or levonorgestrel in women receiving rilpivirine- or darunavir-based ART compared with women without HIV (control group). Participants on ART were switched to rilpivirine-based ART with a run-in period of 6 weeks or darunavir-based ART with a run-in of 2 weeks prior to implant insertion. Plasma was collected on Day 0, and 1, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks post-insertion. Plasma progestin concentrations were compared between ART and control groups by geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 90% CI. RESULTS: At the primary endpoint of Week 24, progestin concentrations were similar between the rilpivirine and control groups [etonogestrel: 1.18 (0.99-1.37); levonorgestrel: 1.16 (0.97-1.33)]. At Week 24, progestin exposure was higher in the darunavir groups compared with the control group [etonogestrel: 2.56 (1.69-3.28); levonorgestrel: 1.89 (1.38-2.29)]. Results remained consistent through to Week 48. No differences in etonogestrel-related adverse events were observed, but both ART groups experienced more menstrual abnormalities versus the control group with levonorgestrel. CONCLUSIONS: Etonogestrel and levonorgestrel concentrations were not altered by rilpivirine-based ART. Although progestin concentrations were higher in the ART groups containing ritonavir-boosted darunavir, no implant-related serious adverse events were observed. Both progestin-releasing implants are an appropriate contraceptive option with either rilpivirine- or darunavir/ritonavir-based ART.
Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) are associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs). The aim of this study was to evaluate improvements in NPAEs after switching an INSTI-based regimen to darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c) or doravirine (DOR). Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the reversibility of NPAEs via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and D) in patients who started antiretroviral therapy with dolutegravir (DTG) or bictegravir (BIC). These patients were switched to DRV/c or DOR. Scales were compared at the moment of the switch and 12 weeks later. Results: We included 1153 treatment-naive men, 676 (58.7%) with BIC and 477 (41.3%) with DTG. A total of 32 (2.7%) experienced NPAEs that led to discontinuation. Insomnia was found in 20 patients; depression via PHQ-9 in 21 patients, via HADS-D in 5 patients, and anxiety via HADS-A in 12 patients. All of them were evaluated by a psychiatrist at the moment of the symptoms; 7 (21.8%) started psychotropic drugs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, PHQ-9, ISI, HADS-A, and HADS-D decreased, with a p-value </= 0.05. Conclusions: NPAEs seem to improve after switching to a DRV/c- or DOR-based regimen after the first 4 and 12 weeks.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate darunavir and cobicistat pharmacokinetics in pregnant women with HIV-1 infection. METHODS: This phase 3b, open-label study enrolled HIV-1-infected pregnant women (18-26 weeks of gestation) receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with once-daily darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg. The plasma pharmacokinetics of darunavir (total and unbound) and cobicistat were assessed over 24 h during the second and third trimesters (24-28 and 34-38 weeks of gestation, respectively) and 6-12 weeks postpartum. Pharmacokinetic parameters [area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC(24 h) ), maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) and minimum plasma concentration (C(min) )] were derived using noncompartmental analysis and compared using linear mixed effects modelling (pregnancy versus postpartum). Antiviral activity and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: Seven women were enrolled in the study; six completed it. Total darunavir exposure was lower during pregnancy than postpartum (AUC(24 h) , 50-56% lower; C(max) , 37-49% lower; C(min) , 89-92% lower); unbound darunavir exposure was also reduced (AUC(24 h) , 40-45% lower; C(max) , 32-41% lower; C(min) , 88-92% lower). Cobicistat exposure was also lower during pregnancy than postpartum (AUC(24 h) , 49-63% lower; C(max) , 27-50% lower; C(min) , 83% lower). At study completion, five of six (83%) women were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL). There was one virological failure (the patient was nonadherent; no emerging genotypic resistance was observed and susceptibility to antiretrovirals was maintained). No mother-to-child transmission was detected among six infants born to the six women who completed the study. Overall, darunavir/cobicistat was well tolerated in women and infants. CONCLUSIONS: In view of markedly reduced darunavir and cobicistat exposures during pregnancy, this combination is not recommended in HIV-1-infected pregnant women.
BACKGROUND: The OPTIPRIM-ANRS 147 trial compared intensive combination ART (darunavir/ritonavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine, raltegravir and maraviroc) started early during primary HIV-1 infection with standard tritherapy with darunavir/ritonavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. From month 6 to 18, the percentage of viral load values <50 copies/mL was lower in the pentatherapy arm than in the tritherapy arm. Here we compared antiretroviral drug concentrations between the two arms. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 50 patients at various times after drug administration. A Bayesian approach based on published population pharmacokinetic models was used to estimate residual drug concentrations (Ctrough) and exposures (AUC) in each patient. A mixed linear regression model was then used to compare the AUC and Ctrough values of each drug used in both groups. RESULTS: Published models adequately described our data and could be used to predict Ctrough and AUC. No significant difference in tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine and ritonavir parameters was found between the two arms. However, darunavir Ctrough and AUC were significantly lower in the pentatherapy arm than in the tritherapy arm (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adding maraviroc and raltegravir to darunavir-based tritherapy decreased darunavir concentrations. Compliance issues, maraviroc-darunavir interaction and raltegravir-darunavir interaction were suspected and may affect the kinetics of viral decay during pentatherapy. A specific pharmacokinetic interaction study is needed to explore the interactions between darunavir and maraviroc and raltegravir.
OBJECTIVES: Darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) in mono or dual therapy has proven efficacy in selected patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of switching from DRV/r to DRV/cobicistat (DRV/c) in patients under mono or dual therapy. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter cohort study of patients using DRV/r under mono or dual therapy plus lamivudine who changed to DRV/c maintaining the previous regimen. All patients had a controlled HIV viral load (<50 copies/ml) when switched and were examined every 12 weeks. The primary end-point was the percentage of participants without virological failure (VF) at week 48 in the intent-to-treat analysis. The CD4 cell count and concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride, and creatinine were measured from baseline to week 48. RESULTS: A total of 162 patients were included: 68.5% were men, and their mean age was 46 +/- 12 years. Seventy (43.2%) patients were treated with DRV/r monotherapy, and 92 (56.8%) were treated with DRV/r plus lamivudine. The efficacy at week 48 was 95.1% (95% CI: 90.6%-97.5%) in the intent-to-treat analysis and 98.7% (95.5-99.6%) in the on-treatment analysis. Two VFs were documented but without development of resistance mutations. No significant changes were found in the lipid profile. Creatinine concentration increased significantly by 0.07 mg/dl (0.04-0.10, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from DRV/r to DRV/c in patients under mono or dual therapy is safe and effective.
BACKGROUND: The drug-drug interactions between pitavastatin and darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) as well as pitavastatin and efavirenz (EFV) were examined in an open-label, parallel-arm, pharmacokinetic (PK) study in HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers. METHODS: Subjects received a pitavastatin dose of 2 mg for 4 days, followed by either EFV 600 mg (n = 14) or DRV/r 800/100 mg (n = 14) daily for 10 days, and pitavastatin 2 mg coadministered with EFV 600 mg or DRV/r 800/100 mg for 4 days. Full PK profiles were determined for pitavastatin and its lactone metabolite on days 4 and 18 and for EFV or DRV on days 14 and 18. RESULTS: In the EFV arm, the geometric mean area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-tau) and Cmax of pitavastatin were 85.3 ng.h.mL and 15.6 ng/mL, respectively, when given alone, versus 76 ng.h.mL and 18.8 ng/mL when coadministered with EFV. The geometric mean ratio for pitavastatin with EFV versus alone was 0.89 [90% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.09] for AUC0-tau and 1.20 (90% CI: 0.79 to 1.83) for Cmax. In the DRV/r arm, AUC0-tau and Cmax were 62.8 ng.h.mL and 24.0 ng/mL, respectively, when pitavastatin was administered alone, versus 56.9 ng.h.mL and 23.2 ng/mL when coadministered with DRV/r. The geometric mean ratio for pitavastatin with DRV/r versus alone was 0.91 (90% CI: 0.78 to 1.06) for AUC0-tau and 0.93 (90% CI: 0.72 to 1.19) for Cmax. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant PK interactions between pitavastatin and EFV or DRV/r. No significant safety issues or lipid changes were noted.
BACKGROUND: To compare the steady state plasma concentrations (Css) of three antiretroviral drugs in both normal and overweight patients, and to determine the relationship between Css and fat mass (FM) or lean body mass. METHODS: Patients treated for more than 6 months once daily with one of the antiretroviral drugs: efavirenz (EFV) 600mg, atazanavir boosted with ritonavir (ATV-r) 300mg/100mg, or darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV-r) 800mg/100mg, combined with two nucleoside analogues, were enrolled prospectively. One at steady state, plasma samples for the assessment of drug concentration were taken and body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients were enrolled (46, 45 and 48 in the groups EFV, ATV-r and DRV-r respectively). Their mean age was 46.2+/-10.4 years, 58% were male, 55.4% were from Sub Sahara African (SSA); body mass index (BMI) was 25.4+/-4.4kg/m(2). Mean drug plasma Css of the three drugs did not differ according to BMI group. DRV-r Css tended to be higher in patients with BMI>/=25kg/m(2) (2896.7+/-1689 versus 2091.9+/-1038, P=0.09) and was significantly correlated with FM (r=0.3, P=0.02). In subgroup analysis, the effect of FM on DRV-r Css was significant in patients from SSA (r=0.4, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Css result from many factors and body composition has been shown to only weakly influence interindividual variability but should be investigated in morbidly obese patients treated with DRV-r.
