Imatinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of the protein tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta) and KIT. Imatinib is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), which have dysregulated activity of an imatinib-sensitive kinase as the underlying pathogenetic feature. Pharmacokinetic studies of imatinib in healthy volunteers and patients with CML, GIST and other cancers show that orally administered imatinib is well absorbed, and has an absolute bioavailability of 98% irrespective of oral dosage form (solution, capsule, tablet) or dosage strength (100 mg, 400 mg). Food has no relevant impact on the rate or extent of bioavailability. The terminal elimination half-life is approximately 18 hours. Imatinib plasma concentrations predictably increase by 2- to 3-fold when reaching steady state with 400mg once-daily administration, to 2.6 +/- 0.8 microg/mL at peak and 1.2 +/- 0.8 microg/mL at trough, exceeding the 0.5 microg/mL (1 micromol/L) concentrations needed for tyrosine kinase inhibition in vitro and leading to normalisation of haematological parameters in the large majority of patients with CML irrespective of baseline white blood cell count. Imatinib is approximately 95% bound to human plasma proteins, mainly albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The drug is eliminated predominantly via the bile in the form of metabolites, one of which (CGP 74588) shows comparable pharmacological activity to the parent drug. The faecal to urinary excretion ratio is approximately 5:1. Imatinib is metabolised mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 or CYP3A5 and can competitively inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 substrates. Interactions may occur between imatinib and inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, leading to changes in the plasma concentration of imatinib as well as coadministered drugs. Hepatic and renal dysfunction, and the presence of liver metastases, may result in more variable and increased exposure to the drug, although typically not necessitating dosage adjustment. Age (range 18-70 years), race, sex and bodyweight do not appreciably impact the pharmacokinetics of imatinib.
Imatinib mesylate is an inhibitor of Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase, which essentially participates the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib is highly effective in the treatment of CML. Because imatinib also inhibits c-kit and platelet-derived growth-factor (PDGF) receptor, it may be efficacious against some tumors which possess c-kit or PDGF receptors.
Targeted therapy of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate has been one of the most striking achievements in modern cancer medicine. However, while imatinib can establish long-term remission in many cases, resistance to or intolerance of imatinib is eventually experienced by a substantial number of patients. Subsequent advances have led to the development of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). One such inhibitor, nilotinib, was rationally designed to increase its affinity and specificity for the oncogenic tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl compared with imatinib and has been shown to be effective after imatinib failure. Recently, nilotinib has been shown to be more effective when used as first-line therapy of chronic phase CML.
Novartis has launched imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl, for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib selectively inhibits activation of target proteins involved in cellular proliferation. It also inhibits c-KIT tyrosine kinase activity and is equally effective against both wild-type and constitutively active enzyme. Close correlation between in vitro responses to IFNalpha and imatinib suggested that it may be an alternative to IFNalpha therapy for chronic-phase CML, and the compound has the advantage that it can be administered orally. Futhermore, Bcr-Abl-expressing cells treated with imatinib undergo apoptosis. Imatinib also has potential for the treatment of other cancers that express these kinases, including acute lymphocytic leukemia and certain solid tumors. In February 2002, the FDA approved imatinib for the treatment of inoperable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST); in September 2001, launch for the indication was expected in 2002. In November 2000, imatinib was granted Orphan Drug status in Japan for the target indication of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. By May 2001, imatinib had entered phase II trials for small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and glioma. Imatinib has been launched in more than 35 countries, including the US, Brazil, Switzerland, Australia and the UK. By December 2001, the drug had also been launched in Japan. The drug is marketed as Gleevec (imatinib mesilate) in the US, and Glivec (imatinib) outside the US. In August 2001, Deutsche Bank estimated sales of SFr 233 million in 2001, rising to SFr 850 million in 2005; while Bear Stearns & Co predicted sales of SFr 250 million in 2001, rising to SFr 800 million in 2005.
Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec, Glivec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) has profoundly changed the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The unprecedented efficacy of a drug that specifically acts on the causative lesion in a malignant disorder is a proof of principle for the concept of molecular targeted therapy. This article will review the development of imatinib as a new therapy for CML. Data regarding the use of higher than the standard dose of 400 mg of imatinib and combinations of imatinib with other antileukemic agents will be discussed in the context of emerging data regarding resistance mechanisms.
