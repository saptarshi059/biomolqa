Cimetidine is a rare cause of drug-induced fever. In a patient without evidence of hypersensitivity (the lymphocytes did not react to the drug in vitro) fever was the sole manifestation of an adverse reaction to cimetidine that was confirmed by challenge with the drug.
This case of an adult with cimetidine-induced hepatitis is presented. An etiologic role for the drug was strongly suggested when the patient developed transient hepatic dysfunction after two reexposures to cimetidine, which reverted promptly on withdrawal of the drug. The temporal relation between the administration of the drug and the development of hepatic dysfunction suggests that it is a hypersensitivity type of reaction.
Although cimetidine is more effective than a placebo for the prophylaxis of stress-induced ulcers, it has no advantage over titrated antacid dosing. Several comparative studies even suggest that combining cimetidine with antacid is no more effective than use of full-dose antacid. Therefore, we recommend prophylactic use of cimetidine only when very large dosages of antacid are required, in order to minimize acid-base disturbances.
BACKGROUND: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is caused by deficiency of the enzyme converting protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) into heme resulting in accumulation of PpIX; leading to photosensitivity and liver toxicity. Cimetidine might inhibit delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase influencing the heme biosynthesis. We present cases with EPP treated with cimetidine at our department, and a literature review. METHODS: Systematic searches were performed to identify literature describing EPP patients treated with cimetidine. On that ground we treated EPP patients with cimetidine through spring and summer in 2020 and 2021 at our department. Their erythrocyte PpIX level and standard blood and liver parameters were collected before and during 4 months of treatment. Using a questionnaire, patients were asked about change in photosensitivity, side effects, and whether they would like to resume treatment in the spring of 2022. RESULTS: Literature searches identified 9 patients treated with cimetidine. Four were outpatients reporting decreased photosensitivity. At our department 18 outpatients started treatment. Fifteen used oral cimetidine daily for 4 months or more providing a significant decrease in erythrocyte PpIX with a median of 20% (range: -18% to 53%) after 4 months. Eleven of the 15 patients reported a decrease in photosensitivity during treatment, 3 patients were unsure, and 1 patient experienced unchanged photosensitivity. Only mild side effects were reported. Fourteen patients requested to resume treatment in the spring of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: These cases suggest that cimetidine can lower erythrocyte PpIX in patients with EPP.
A patient is described who developed reversible renal failure while taking cimetidine.
