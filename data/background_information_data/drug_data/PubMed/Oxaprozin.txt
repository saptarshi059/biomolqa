Oxaprozin, a propionic acid derivative, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity has been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models.1 The majority of published clinical trials have focused on the use of oxaprozin (from Searle) in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which reaches peak plasma concentrations 2 to 6 hours after oral administration. Oxaprozin binds extensively, in a concentration-dependent manner, to plasma albumin. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of oxaprozin is linearly proportional to the dose for oral doses up to 1200 mg. At doses greater than 1200 mg there is an increase in the unbound fraction of drug, leading to an increased clearance and volume of distribution (Vd) of total oxaprozin. Accumulation of the drug at steady state is between 40 and 58% lower than predicted by single dose data. After administration of multiple doses, the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and Vd of total oxaprozin increased while those of the unbound drug decreased significantly. Substantial concentrations of oxaprozin are attained in synovial fluid, which is a proposed site of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Relationships between total plasma, unbound plasma and synovial concentrations, and therapeutic and toxicological effects have yet to be established. Oxaprozin is eliminated following biotransformation to glucuroconjugated metabolites which are excreted in urine and bile, with little drug being eliminated unchanged. Two hydroxylated metabolites have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity. Hepatic disease and rheumatoid arthritis do not significantly alter the disposition of oxaprozin. Patients with renal impairment demonstrate an increase in unbound plasma concentrations of oxaprozin. A significant drug interaction has been demonstrated between oxaprozin and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid).
Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug characterised by a propionic acid-based structure. It is able to diffuse easily into inflamed synovial tissues after oral administration. Although discovered > 20 years ago, it is now under intensive investigation because of its unusual pharmacodynamic properties. Other than being a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, the drug is capable of inhibiting both anandamide hydrolase in neurons (median inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 85 micromol/l), with consequent potent analgesic activity, and NF-kappaB activation in inflammatory cells (IC50 = 50 micromol/l). Moreover, oxaprozin induces apoptosis of activated monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect being detectable at a concentration of 5 micromol/l and reaching the maximum activity at 50 micromol/l. As monocyte-macrophages and NF-kappaB pathways are crucial for synthesis of proinflammatory and histotoxic mediators in inflamed joints, oxaprozin appears to be endowed with pharmacodynamic properties exceeding those presently assumed as markers of classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
The kinetics of a single 1200 mg oral dose of oxaprozin, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent of the propionic acid class, was studied in 22 healthy female volunteers aged 21 to 64 years. Eleven subjects had been taking a conjugated estrogen preparation for at least 3 months; the other 11 subjects served as control women who were not taking conjugated estrogens. Mean pharmacokinetic variables in control and conjugated estrogen groups were: volume of distribution, 15.1 vs 14.1 l; elimination half-life, 59.8 vs 54.2 h; clearance, 3.2 vs 3.1 ml/min; peak plasma concentration, 84.8 vs 90.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. None of the differences were significant. However, the time of peak concentration (8.9 vs 4.0 h) was significantly longer in the control group than in the conjugated estrogen group, respectively (p less than 0.05). Oxaprozin clearance, accomplished by a combination of oxidation and conjugation, is unimpaired by coadministration of conjugated estrogens.
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of oxaprozin are reviewed. Oxaprozin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) under consideration for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, is characterized as a propionic acid. By inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase, oxaprozin decreases the formation of prostaglandin (PG) precursors from arachidonic acid, resulting in decreased PG biosynthesis and reduced pain and inflammatory responses. Oxaprozin is well absorbed after oral administration, and peak plasma concentration is reached in three to six hours. Oxaprozin is primarily eliminated by urinary excretion of the unchanged drug. It has a long elimination half-life and persists in synovial fluid. In clinical studies, oxaprozin was equally or more effective than aspirin and as effective as naproxen in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. For treatment of osteoarthritis, oxaprozin was as effective as naproxen and more effective than aspirin or piroxicam. Studies have also shown oxaprozin to be effective therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Oxaprozin, like other NSAIDs, can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects. Other possible adverse effects include allergic reactions, analgesic nephropathy, hepatotoxicity, and increased bleeding times. For adults, the anticipated daily dosage is 600-1200 mg given as a single dose for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and analgesia. In children, oxaprozin 10-20 mg/kg/day has been used to treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Oxaprozin is as effective as other NSAIDs and offers once-daily dosing; however, it does not offer any therapeutic advantage over other currently available NSAIDs.
