Treatment of HIV-1 infections with nevirapine is associated with skin and liver toxicity. These two organ toxicities range from mild to severe, in rare cases resulting in life-threatening liver failure or toxic epidermal necrolysis. The study of the mechanistic steps leading to nevirapine-induced skin rash has been facilitated by the discovery of an animal model in which nevirapine causes a skin rash in rats that closely mimics the rash reported in patients. The similarity in characteristics of the rash between humans and rats strongly suggests that the basic mechanism is the same in both. The rash is clearly immune-mediated in rats, and partial depletion of CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, is protective. We have demonstrated that the rash is related to the 12-hydroxylation of nevirapine rather than to the parent drug. This is presumably because the 12-hydroxy metabolite can be converted to a reactive quinone methide in skin, but that remains to be demonstrated. Although the rash is clearly related to the 12-hydroxy metabolite rather than the parent drug, cells from rechallenged animals respond ex vivo to the parent drug by producing cytokines such as interferon-gamma with little response to the 12-hydroxy metabolite, even when the rash was induced by treatment with the metabolite rather than the parent drug. This indicates that the response of T cells in vitro cannot be used to determine what caused an immune response. We are now studying the detailed steps by which the 12-hydroxy metabolite induces an immune response and skin rash. This animal model provides a unique tool to study the mechanistic details of an idiosyncratic drug reaction; however, it is likely that there are significant differences in the mechanisms of different idiosyncratic drug reactions, and therefore the results of these studies cannot safely be generalized to all idiosyncratic drug reactions.
Nevirapine and other members of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) family of anti-HIV-1 drugs are essential components of antiretroviral treatment regimens. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become an important issue with respect to all therapeutic targets in HIV-1. This paper summarizes current knowledge about the mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV-1 that are responsible for drug resistance and the mechanisms whereby drug resistance develops.
Nevirapine is metabolized by several hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms to generate four primary hydroxylated metabolites: 2-hydroxynevirapine, 3-hydroxynevirapine, 8-hydroxynevirapine, and 12-hydroxynevirapine. The present study characterized associations between genetic polymorphisms and metabolite ratios in HIV-infected Cambodians. We demonstrate associations between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and metabolite ratios for both 3-hydroxynevirapine and 8-hydroxynevirapine, suggesting involvement of CYP2B6 in generating these metabolites.
The number of HIV-infected patients who are newly exposed to nevirapine is increasing worldwide. To minimize toxicity, clinicians must adhere to dosing guidelines, avoid prescribing the drug in patients with known increased risk of toxicity, and promptly recognize toxicities, which are mainly cutaneous and hepatic. These toxicities are more common with nevirapine than with efavirenz. Women with CD4 counts>250 cells/mm3 have particularly increased susceptibility to nevirapine toxicity. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of nevirapine toxicity, and its relationship with pharmacokinetic parameters, genetic factors and cellular immune kinetics will enhance our ability to reduce the risk to the HIV-infected individual.
The contribution of efavirenz and nevirapine remains clinically relevant and is the reason for the frequent prescription of these two agents. Recent clinical data on efavirenz and nevirapine in naive patients confirms their effectiveness compared to protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/r (ACTG 5142) or atazanavir/r (ACTG 5202) for efavirenz, or such as atazanavir/r (ARTEN trial) for nevirapine. Their easy use is another advantage; efavirenz is part of the first triple therapy as a single tablet given once a day, and nevirapine, with its new extended-release formulation, was designed for a single daily intake. However, the two agents exhibit different safety profiles and pharmacological properties. Their penetration rates in the genital tracts are different (70 to 80% for nevirapine versus 0 to 3% for efavirenz in men and 13-80% for nevirapine versus 0 to 4% for efavirenz in women). Finally, the authors of two recent studies reported the differences in the residual VL measured by ultrasensitive assays in successfully treated patients. The VL of patients treated with nevirapine was significantly more frequently below the detection limit of 1 or 2.5 RNA copies/mL than patients treated with efavirenz.
