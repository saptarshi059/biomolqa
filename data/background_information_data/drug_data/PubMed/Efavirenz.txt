Many patients switch from efavirenz- to dolutegravir-based regimens. In a phase 1 dolutegravir-efavirenz interaction study, mean dolutegravir minimum concentration decreased by 60% and 85% among CYP2B6 normal and slow/intermediate metabolizers, respectively. Mean efavirenz half-life was 2.7 times greater in slow vs normal metabolizers. Slow metabolizers will experience more prolonged subtherapeutic dolutegravir concentrations.
Rilpivirine is an orally administered, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is a component drug in combination therapy for antiretroviral-naive patients with HIV-1 infection. The randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multinational ECHO and THRIVE trials in antiretroviral-naive adult patients with HIV-1 infection compared rilpivirine with efavirenz, administered with background nucleoside/nucleotide antiretroviral regimens. Rilpivirine 25 mg once daily recipients had a treatment response (confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA level of <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks; primary endpoint) that was noninferior to that of efavirenz 600 mg once daily recipients. The response rates in the rilpivirine and efavirenz groups were 83% and 84% (ECHO) and 87% and 83% (THRIVE). Virological failure rates in rilpivirine and efavirenz groups in the intent-to-treat analysis were 11% and 4% in the ECHO trial and 7% and 5% in the THRIVE trial. In a pooled analysis of both trials, in rilpivirine recipients with an HIV-1 RNA level of >100,000 copies/mL at baseline, the virological failure rate at 48 weeks was 15% (vs 6% with efavirenz), whereas in those with a level of </=100,000 copies/mL, the virological failure rate was 4% (vs 3% with efavirenz). In general, rilpivirine was better tolerated than efavirenz throughout treatment. Rilpivirine recipients had significantly fewer treatment-related adverse events, discontinuations because of adverse events, psychiatric-neurological adverse events and a significantly lower rate of blood lipid abnormalities.
Individuals with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at higher risk of developing adverse drug reactions. Multiple drugs are usually prescribed to patients with HIV infection for preventing the replication of HIV and for the treatment of the associated opportunistic infections. We report here the first case of an HIV-1-infected patient who developed an exfoliative dermatitis induced by efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of efavirenz-induced skin eruptions from the start of antiviral treatment of HIV infection.
Efavirenz (Sustiva((R))) is a first-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection or to prevent the spread of HIV. In 1998, the FDA authorized efavirenz for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Patients formerly required three 200 mg efavirenz capsules daily, which was rapidly updated to a 600 mg tablet that only required one tablet per day. However, when given 600 mg once daily, plasma efavirenz concentrations were linked not only to poor HIV suppression but also to toxicity. Clinical data suggested that the standard dose of efavirenz could be reduced without compromising its effectiveness, resulting in a reduction in side effects and making the drug more affordable. Therefore, ENCORE1 was performed to compare the efficiency and safeness of a reduced dose of efavirenz (400 mg) with the standard dose (600 mg) plus two NRTI in antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected individuals. Nowadays, due to the emergence of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), some consider that it is time to stop using efavirenz as a first-line treatment on a global scale, in the parts of the world where that is possible. Efavirenz has been a primary first-line antiviral drug for more than 15 years. However, at this moment, the best use for efavirenz could be for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and repurposing in medicine.
Evidence of the risk of birth defects with efavirenz use is limited. We updated a meta-analysis of birth defects in infants with first trimester efavirenz exposure up to July 2011. In 21 studies, there were 39 defects among live births in 1437 women receiving first trimester efavirenz [2.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-3.18]. The relative risk of defects comparing women on efavirenz-based (1290 live births) and nonefavirenz-based regimens (8122 live births) was 0.85 (95% CI 0.61-1.20). One neural tube defect was observed (myelomeningocele), giving an incidence of 0.07% (95% CI 0.002-0.39).
