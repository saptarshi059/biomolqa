Amphetamine was discovered over 100 years ago. Since then, it has transformed from a drug that was freely available without prescription as a panacea for a broad range of disorders into a highly restricted Controlled Drug with therapeutic applications restricted to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. This review describes the relationship between chemical structure and pharmacology of amphetamine and its congeners. Amphetamine's diverse pharmacological actions translate not only into therapeutic efficacy, but also into the production of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse. Accordingly, the balance of benefit/risk is the key challenge for its clinical use. The review charts advances in pharmaceutical development from the introduction of once-daily formulations of amphetamine through to lisdexamfetamine, which is the first d-amphetamine prodrug approved for the management of ADHD in children, adolescents and adults. The unusual metabolic route for lisdexamfetamine to deliver d-amphetamine makes an important contribution to its pharmacology. How lisdexamfetamine's distinctive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile translates into sustained efficacy as a treatment for ADHD and its reduced potential for recreational abuse is also discussed.
Amphetamines are the second most commonly used illicit drug worldwide. Amphetamine use can result in significant cutaneous morbidity. This review highlights the dermatological manifestations of amphetamine abuse.
The relationship between amphetamine use and aggressive or violent behaviour is unclear. This review examined laboratory data collected in humans, who were administered an acute dose of amphetamine or methamphetamine, in order to investigate the link between amphetamines and aggression. It is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019127711). Included in the analysis are data from twenty-eight studies. Behavioural and/or subjective measures of aggression were assessed in one thousand and sixty-nine research participants, with limited amphetamine-use histories, following a single amphetamine dose (0-35 mg). The available published evidence indicates that neither amphetamine nor methamphetamine acutely increased aggression as assessed by traditional laboratory measures. Future research should assess supratherapeutic amphetamine doses as well as include a broader range of multiple aggression measures, facilitating simultaneous assessment of the various components that comprise this complex, multifaceted construct.
There is a plethora of amphetamine derivatives exerting stimulant, euphoric, anti-fatigue, and hallucinogenic effects; all structural properties allowing these effects are contained within the amphetamine structure. In the first part of this review, the interaction of amphetamine with the dopamine transporter (DAT), crucially involved in its behavioral effects, is covered, as well as the role of dopamine synthesis, the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, and organic cation 3 transporter (OCT3). The second part deals with requirements in amphetamine's effect on the kinases PKC, CaMKII, and ERK, whereas the third part focuses on where we are in developing anti-amphetamine therapeutics. Thus, treatments are discussed that target DAT, VMAT2, PKC, CaMKII, and OCT3. As is generally true for the development of therapeutics for substance use disorder, there are multiple preclinically promising specific compounds against (meth)amphetamine, for which further development and clinical trials are badly needed.
A 32-year-old man had acute renal failure after ingesting amphetamines. The renal biopsy findings indicated acute interstitial nephritis. In contrast to other reports, which indicate an association between coexisting rhabdomyolysis, hyperpyrexia, or necrotizing angiitis and acute renal failure in amphetamine abusers, our case suggests that amphetamine alone may cause acute renal injury.
