OBJECTIVES: We report information about an unpublished 1970s study ("8-way" Bendectin Study) that aimed to evaluate the relative therapeutic efficacy of doxylamine, pyridoxine, and dicyclomine in the management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. We are publishing the trial's findings according to the restoring invisible and abandoned trials (RIAT) initiative because the trial was never published. DESIGN: Double blinded, multi-centred, randomized placebo-controlled study. SETTING: 14 clinics in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 2308 patients in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy with complaints of nausea or vomiting were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient was randomized to one of eight arms: placebo, doxylamine/pyridoxine/dicylcomine, doxylamine/pyridoxine, dicylomine/pyridoxine, doxylamine, dicyclomine/pyridoxine, pyridoxine and dicyclomine. Each patient was instructed to take 2 tablets at bedtime and 1 additional tablet in the afternoon or morning if needed, for 7 nights. OUTCOMES: Reported outcomes included the number of hours of nausea reported by patients, the frequency of vomiting reported by patients and the overall efficacy of medication as judged by physicians. RESULTS: Data from 1599 (69% of those randomized) participants were analyzed. Based on the available summary data of physician evaluation of symptoms and ignoring missing data and data integrity issues, the proportion of participants who were "evaluated moderate or excellent" was greater in each of the seven active treatment groups when compared with placebo (57%): doxylamine/pyridoxine/dicylcomine (14% absolute difference versus placebo; 95% CI: 4 to 24), doxylamine/pyridoxine (21; 95% CI 11 to 30), dicylomine/pyridoxine (21; 95% CI 11 to 30), doxylamine (20; 95% CI 10 to 29), dicyclomine/pyridoxine (4; 95% CI -6 to 14), pyridoxine (9; 95% CI -1 to 19) and dicyclomine (4; 95% CI -6 to 14). Based on incomplete information, the most common adverse events were apparently drowsiness and fatigue. There is a high risk of bias in these previously unpublished results given the high attrition rate in a 7 day trial, the lack of prespecified outcomes or analyses, and the exclusion of some data because of questionable data integrity. CONCLUSION: The available information about this "8-way Bendectin" trial indicates it should not be used to support the efficacy of doxylamine, pyridoxine or dicyclomine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy because of a high risk of bias. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not registered.
In a prospective cohort study of 20, 282 gravidas and their offspring, congenital malformation rates were similar in the children of over 1,000 women exposed and those not exposed to two components of Bendectin (doxylamine succinate and dicyclomine hydrochloride) during the first four lunar months of pregnancy. In a cohort reduced to 41,337 mother-child pairs for technical reasons, mean birth weight and perinatal mortality rates were similar according to exposure or nonexposure to either drug, as were intelligence quotient scores measured at four years of age in 28,358 of the children. Control of potential confounding factors with a variety of multivariate techniques did not materially alter these findings.
Recent publicity regarding possible teratogenic effects of the doxylamine/dicyclomine/pyridoxine combination (Debendox) has led to a degree of apprehension in women for whom the drug is prescribed, and in doctors who prescribe it. This study, based on an ongoing epidemiological surveillance programme, reports an analysis of the records of 1817 women for whom the drug was prescribed compared with 5771 non-users. The object of the study was to evaluate the outcome of pregnancy against exposure to the drug, taking into account the coexistent influences of other factors. Thorough statistical analysis disclosed no evidence of teratogenicity of the doxylamine/dicyclomine/pyridoxine overall, nor in relation to the skeletal or cardiovascular systems in particular. Two unexpected findings were an apparent moderate increase in genital tract abnormalities in users of this drug, and the possibility of a synergistic relationship between tobacco and this drug in early pregnancy, both aspects warranting further investigation.
Symptomatic treatment of the uninhibited bladder has presented a challenge because of the lack of an effective, well tolerated smooth muscle relaxant for the bladder that can be used during an extended interval. In a preliminary study oral dicyclomine produced resolution or significant improvement of symptoms in 24 of 27 patients and an increase in bladder capacity by an average of 137 plus or minus 26 ml. (91 plus or minus 22 per cent) after 8 weeks of therapy. Additional controlled trials definitely are warranted.
Using a double-blind crossover technique in patients suffering from maladies associated with gastrointestinal spasm, sustained-release 40 mg dicyclomine hydrochloride tablets (Merbentyl Dospan) have been compared with 20 mg plain dicyclomine hydrochloride tablets (Merbentyl). It has been concluded that these two dicyclomine formulations are equivalent in terms of efficacy and low incidence of side effects.
Lipase is one of the most important groups of enzymes for industry and medicine. It breaks down triacylglycerol to glycerol and fatty acids. Some bacteria use lipase to degrade the extracellular matrix of the host cells to penetrate into the tissues. Dicyclomine is a muscarinic antagonist receptor that relieves the smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract and affects the cardiovascular system. In this research, the effect of a dicyclomine on the lipase activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. Hanes-Woolf plot showed that the drug inhibited the enzyme by competitive inhibition. The IC(50) value (60uM) and Ki (30uM) of the drug revealed that the drug bound to enzyme with high affinity. Determination of enzyme activity in various temperature showed that the maximum activity of lipase was at 60 degrees C both in the presence and absence of the drug. Arrhenius plot determined that the activation energy of the enzyme reaction was increased in the presence of the drug. The model of binding demonstrated that the drug entered a pocket containing 10 amino acids and interacted by hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction and the conformational change of the enzyme after binding of the drug was confirmed by fluorescence measurement.
Background: Contraction alkalosis is characterized by low serum sodium and chloride and high serum carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. Case Report: A 28-year-old Caucasian active-duty male with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (D-IBS) presented to his primary care provider (PCP) with elevated blood pressure (136/96 mmHg), was diagnosed with stage-2 hypertension, and started oral HCTZ (25 mg/day). His medications included dicyclomine (10 mg oral three times daily). Subsequently, (Visit 1), his blood pressure was 130/91 mmHg and he was started on telmisartan (20 mg/day). At Visit 2, 4 weeks later, his blood pressure improved (121/73 mmHg); however, blood chemistry revealed elevated serum CO2 (32 mEq/L) and chloride (94 mmol/L). Four days later, the patient presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea and swallowing difficulty. The patient returned to his PCP 3 days later complaining of cough, congestion, vomiting, and mild dyspnea, blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. Two months later, sudden onset of projectile vomiting and abdominal pain while running was reported, resolved by rehydration and a single oral dose of prochlorperazine 25 mg. Three months later, (Visit 3), he complained of lightheadedness and cloudy judgment, suggesting contraction alkalosis. HCTZ was discontinued and telmisartan was increased to 20 mg twice daily. A follow-up blood chemistry panel 2 weeks later revealed serum chloride and CO2 levels within normal limits and blood pressure under 130/80 mmHg. Conclusion: This is the first known report of contraction alkalosis driven by drug-drug interaction between dicyclomine and HCTZ.
In two deaths of infants investigated by the Medical Examiner, high levels of dicyclomine were detected in blood. In one of the cases, a level of 0.505 micrograms/ml was found, nearly 10 times reported adult therapeutic blood concentrations, and death was ascribed to an overdose of dicyclomine. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for the analysis of biological specimens.
