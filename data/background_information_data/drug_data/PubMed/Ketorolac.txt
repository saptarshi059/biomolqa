OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of posttonsillectomy bleeding in patients who received intraoperative ketorolac tromethamine. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Three hundred eleven patients who underwent tonsillectomy in an 18-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Occurrence of bleeding complications in patients who received ketorolac during tonsillectomy. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 311 patients who underwent tonsillectomy received intraoperative ketorolac with an overall postoperative bleeding rate of 17%. This high rate of bleeding complications compares with 4.4% in the remaining 253 patients who received traditional opioid analgesics. CONCLUSIONS: Until further controlled studies have been conducted, the use of ketorolac in patients undergoing tonsillectomy should be avoided because of the increased incidence of postoperative bleeding complications.
Clinical questionDoes the analgesic effect of intravenous ketorolac differ if given in doses of 10, 15, or 30 mg to patients presenting to the emergency department with acute pain?Article chosenMotov S, Yasavolian M, Likourezos A, et al. Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three single-dose regimens for treating acute pain in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial. Ann Emerg Med 2017;70(2):177-84.
BACKGROUND: The use of ketorolac in children undergoing tonsillectomy remains limited because of the concern about postoperative bleeding. METHODS: A search was performed addressing the question: For patients undergoing a surgical tonsillectomy, does a weight-appropriate single dose of intravenous ketorolac affect the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage? RESULTS: Five systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. A Cochrane Review included 15 studies with 1,101 pediatric subjects and focused on perioperative bleeding requiring intervention. Many of the systematic reviews appraised the same studies. Subgroup analysis often allowed assessment of the effects of ketorolac administration. FINDING: There was no consensus on the increased risk of bleeding when nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketorolac are given to pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy. The conclusions varied from ketorolac should not be used to it is safe to use with these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The perianesthesia team must carefully weigh the risks and benefits before deciding to use ketorolac with this subset of patients.
It's time to review our dosing with ketorolac for acute pain management.
Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is used to achieve biliary decompression in jaundiced patients with biliary obstruction. High drain output >2000 mL/day is rare, and can cause dehydration and electrolyte derangements, without effective treatments. We present the first patient, to our knowledge, who reacted to the use of the analgesic ketorolac with progressive reduction in biliary output, in the setting of malignant biliary obstruction from duodenal adenocarcinoma.
