The role of gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in the pathophysiology of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is now uncontested. Although the definitive mechanism has not been established, the association with weaker GBCA ligands and with reduced renal clearance supports a hypothesis that Gd release from the GBCAs is a key process in precipitating the disease. Prevention strategies often include the use of more stable GBCA ligands in patients with reduced kidney function, but animal models and some clinical data suggest that better patient outcomes can be achieved when excess ligand is administered with weaker GBCAs; this is particularly significant for OptiMARK, which contains a nonionic, linear ligand similar to gadodiamide, the active ingredient in Omniscan, but contains twice the amount of excess ligand. Here we review evidence regarding the use of OptiMARK over Omniscan for prevention of NSF and perform a pharmacokinetic-based simulation to determine if the presented evidence is consistent with the established kinetics of GBCAs and Gd.
BACKGROUND: Today, although gadolinium based contrast agents have been frequently used in the field of medicine, there is limited data available whether gadolinium based agents affect the genome. AIM: The present study aimed to investigate the genotoxic and cytotoxic potentials of gadoteric acid and gadoversetamide used as gadolinium-based contrast agents for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was applied to human peripheral blood lymphocytes to assess the genotoxicity measured as micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPBs) and nuclear bud (NBUDs) frequencies. Furthermore, cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) was calculated to determine cytostasis. Lymphocytes were treated with gadoteric acid at concentrations of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 25 mM and with gadoversetamide at concentrations of 0.25, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mM for 48 h. RESULTS: Gadoteric acid did not cause significant increase in MN, NBPs and NBUDs frequencies and CBPI values at any concentration. Gadoversetamide induced significantly increase MN formation at concentration of 2.5 mM, NBP formation at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.5 mM, and NBUD formation at concentrations of 0.25, 1.0 and 2.5 mM. Additionally, gadoversetamide exposure resulted in statistically significant decrease in CBPI values compared to the control at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mM. In addition, CBPI levels in response to concentrations of gadoversetamide was negatively and significantly associated with concentration. CONCLUSION: These findings show that gadoteric acid does not have genotoxic or cytotoxic potential, while gadoversetamide might have both genotoxic and cytotoxic potential on human peripheral blood lymphocytes. As a comparison, gadoversetamide was found more genotoxic and cytotoxic.
Gadobutrol and gadoversetamide are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) widely used during magnetic resonance imaging examination. In this study, the genotoxicity of two GBCAs, gadobutrol and gadoversetamide, was investigated by using different endpoints: chromosome aberration (CAs), sister chromatid exchange (SCEs), and micronucleus (MNi). Human peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) were treated with five concentrations (7 000, 14 000, 28 000, 56 000, and 112 000 mug/mL) of both agents. While a few concentrations of gadobutrol significantly increased abnormal cell frequency and CA/Cell, nearly all the concentrations of gadoversetamide significantly elevated the same aberrations. Similarly, the effect of gadoversetamide on the formation of SCEs was higher than those of gadobutrol. Only one concentration of gadoversetamide significantly increased MN% but no gadobutrol. The comet assay was applied for the only gadobutrol which induced a significant increase in tail intensity at the highest concentration only. On the other hand, significantly decreased mitotic index (MI) was observed following both substances, again gadoversetamide was slightly higher than those of the gadobutrol. The results revealed that both the contrast agents are likely to induce genotoxic risk in PBLs. However, different concentrations and treatment periods should be examined in vitro and specifically in vivo with different test systems for the safer usage of these contrast agents.
BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) can occur unexpectedly and be life-threatening when gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used. Gadolinium deposition disease (GDD) and symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure (SAGE) have been controversial for a long time. However, similar studies are currently incomplete or outdated. Therefore, comparing the safety of different GBCAs in terms of HSRs and GDD/SAGE using the latest post-marketing safety data should yield further insights into safely using GBCAs. METHODS: The safety differences between all GBCAs to GDD and the spectrum of GBCA-related HSRs were all compared and analyzed by using the World Health Organization database VigiBase and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database in this study. A further analysis of SAGE was also conducted using FAERS data. The lower limit of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) 95% confidence interval was used for signal detection. Moreover, the frequency of HSRs was calculated by dividing the number of reports in VigiBase by the total sales volume (measured in millions) from 2008 to 2022 in the IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System. All adverse events were standardized using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 26.0. RESULTS: This study shows that all GBCAs have the potential to induce HSRs, with nonionic linear GBCAs exhibiting a comparatively lower signal. According to standardized MedDRA query stratification analysis, gadobutrol had a greater ROR(025) for angioedema. The ROR(025) of gadobenate dimeglumine and gadoteridol is larger for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock conditions. Regarding severe cutaneous adverse reactions, only gadoversetamide and gadodiamide showed signals in FAERS and VigiBase. There were also differences in the frequency of HSRs between regions. Regarding GDD, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol had a lower ROR(025). An analysis of the 29 preferred terms linked to SAGE indicated that special consideration should be given to the risk of skin induration associated with gadoversetamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, and gadoteridol. Additionally, gadodiamide and gadoteridol pose a greater risk of skin tightness compared to other GBCAs. CONCLUSIONS: The risk differences among GBCAs using data from several sources were compared in this study. However, as a hypothesis-generating method, a clear causal relationship would require further research and validation.
Background Hypersensitivity reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) that occur despite corticosteroid premedication (breakthrough reactions) are not well understood. Purpose To determine the GBCA breakthrough reaction rate overall and according to GBCA class and to determine the effect of using an alternative GBCA or allergy skin testing on the risk of a breakthrough reaction. Materials and Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE (from 1946 to 2019), Embase (from 1947 to 2019), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2019 only) were searched for patients with a breakthrough reaction to a GBCA who were undergoing repeat GBCA administration. Breakthrough reaction rates were determined with random-effects modeling and meta-regression. Secondary analyses of GBCA class, switching to an alternative GBCA, and allergy skin testing were assessed. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 was used to determine risk of bias and applicability. Percentages are meta-regression results and do not directly reflect raw data. Results Of the 148 identified studies, 23 were included, encompassing 120 patients and 130 GBCA administrations. The overall breakthrough reaction rate was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30%, 49%; 37 of 103 administrations). Breakthrough reaction rates for macrocyclic (36%; 95% CI: 25%, 48%; 23 of 64 administrations) and protein-binding linear (31%; 95% CI: 1%, 94%; [one of seven administrations) GBCAs did not differ (P = .90). There were insufficient analyzable data for gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, and gadopentetate. Hypersensitivity reaction rate after switching GBCAs was 50% (95% CI: 21%, 79%; three of nine administrations) with and 71% (95% CI: 21%, 95%; four of five administrations) without corticosteroid premedication, which did not differ (P = .82 and P = .17, respectively) from the observed rate when using corticosteroid premedication and the same GBCA (36%; 95% CI: 26%, 48%; 37 of 84 administrations). Hypersensitivity reaction rate after allergy skin testing (17%; 95% CI: 7%, 29%; zero of 21 studies) did not differ when compared with use of the same agent with corticosteroid premedication (P = .10). Meta-analysis limitations were the small number of patients and the high risk of bias. Conclusion Patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) often had breakthrough reactions. The effect of switching to an alternative GBCA or using allergy skin testing to decrease reaction risk lacked enough available data for meaningful comparisons.
