: Alprazolam is one of the most widely prescribed benzodiazepines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Its clinical use has been a point of contention as most addiction specialists consider it to be highly addictive, given its unique psychodynamic properties which limit its clinical usefulness, whereas many primary care physicians continue to prescribe it for longer periods than recommended. Clinical research data has not fully shed light on its "abuse liability," yet it is one of the most frequently prescribed benzodiazepines. "Abuse liability" is the degree to which a psychoactive drug has properties that facilitate people misusing it, or becoming addicted to it, and is commonly used in the literature. We have replaced it in our manuscript with "misuse liability" as it reflects a more updated terminology consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). In this paper, we have reviewed alprazolam's indications for use, its effect on pregnant women, misuse liability, withdrawal syndrome, pharmacodynamic properties, and suggest better clinical prescription practice of alprazolam by presenting an indepth theory of its clinical effects with use and withdrawal.
A cumulative review of case reports in the literature describing withdrawal reactions secondary to alprazolam is presented. In four of eight reports, the primary withdrawal manifestations were grand mal seizures. One case was characterized by painful myoclonus. In the remaining three cases, the major complications consisted of rebound anxiety with psychotic features. Despite tapering of the daily dosage according to manufacturer guidelines, a withdrawal syndrome was precipitated in three of the cases. As a result of alprazolam's atypical pharmacodynamic profile, the issue is raised as to whether alprazolam is pharmacologically cross-tolerant with other benzodiazepines.
This article reviews the evidence on the efficacy of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and of alprazolam in the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia. It also presents guidelines to the clinician on how to implement these treatments in practice.
Effective tinnitus relief can be achieved in a large percentage of patients using appropriately selected wearable devices that provide masking of the tinnitus. Guidelines are presented for selecting between three types of devices for that purpose: (1) tinnitus maskers; (2) hearing aids; and (3) tinnitus instruments (units that combine hearing aid and masker in the same case). For patients whose tinnitus cannot be masked, oral administration of alprazolam may be an effective alternative, which should be done with the knowledge and cooperation of the patient's primary care physician. Dosages and guidelines for administering alprazolam are presented.
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of alprazolam in the treatment of tinnitus. The Johnson trial is the only study to date assessing the role of alprazolam, and at best it is an open-label trial demonstrating activity. There is a need for definitive double-blind, controlled, crossover studies of sufficient statistical power to resolve the issue. Furthermore, once efficacy is demonstrated, further studies are needed to determine the appropriate length of therapy, the necessity for maintenance therapy, the role of "drug holidays," appropriate dose tapering schedules, and a more careful delineation of which populations of patients are more likely to respond to alprazolam.
