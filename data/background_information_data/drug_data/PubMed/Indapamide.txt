The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure-the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)-and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring-the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has often been contrasted with chlorthalidone, but relatively little is known about HCTZ versus indapamide (INDAP). This systematic review retrieved 9765 publications, and from these, it identified 14 randomized trials with 883 patients comparing HCTZ with INDAP and chlorthalidone on antihypertensive potency or metabolic effects. To make fair comparisons, the dose of the diuretic in each arm was assigned 1 of 3 dose levels. In random effects meta-analysis, INDAP and chlorthalidone lowered systolic blood pressure more than HCTZ: -5.1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -8.7 to -1.6); P=0.004 and -3.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -7.3 to 0.0); P=0.052, respectively. For both comparisons, there was minimal heterogeneity in effect across trials and no evidence for publication bias. The HCTZ-INDAP contrast was biased in favor of greater HCTZ potency because of a much greater contribution to the overall effect from trials in which the HCTZ arm had a higher dose level than the INDAP arm. For the HCTZ-INDAP comparison, no single trial was responsible for the overall result nor was it possible to detect significant modifications of this comparison by duration of follow-up, high- versus low-bias trials, or the presence or absence of background medications. There were no detectable differences between HCTZ and INDAP in metabolic adverse effects, including effects on serum potassium. In conclusion, these head-to-head comparisons demonstrate that, like chlorthalidone, INDAP is more potent than HCTZ at commonly prescribed doses without evidence for greater adverse metabolic effects.
BACKGROUND: Blood pressure is an important determinant of the risks of macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, and guidelines recommend intensive lowering of blood pressure for diabetic patients with hypertension. We assessed the effects of the routine administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-diuretic combination on serious vascular events in patients with diabetes, irrespective of initial blood pressure levels or the use of other blood pressure lowering drugs. METHODS: The trial was done by 215 collaborating centres in 20 countries. After a 6-week active run-in period, 11 140 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to treatment with a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide or matching placebo, in addition to current therapy. The primary endpoints were composites of major macrovascular and microvascular events, defined as death from cardiovascular disease, non-fatal stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and new or worsening renal or diabetic eye disease, and analysis was by intention-to-treat. The macrovascular and microvascular composites were analysed jointly and separately. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00145925. FINDINGS: After a mean of 4.3 years of follow-up, 73% of those assigned active treatment and 74% of those assigned control remained on randomised treatment. Compared with patients assigned placebo, those assigned active therapy had a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 5.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 2.2 mm Hg. The relative risk of a major macrovascular or microvascular event was reduced by 9% (861 [15.5%] active vs 938 [16.8%] placebo; hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00, p=0.04). The separate reductions in macrovascular and microvascular events were similar but were not independently significant (macrovascular 0.92; 0.81-1.04, p=0.16; microvascular 0.91; 0.80-1.04, p=0.16). The relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 18% (211 [3.8%] active vs 257 [4.6%] placebo; 0.82, 0.68-0.98, p=0.03) and death from any cause was reduced by 14% (408 [7.3%] active vs 471 [8.5%] placebo; 0.86, 0.75-0.98, p=0.03). There was no evidence that the effects of the study treatment differed by initial blood pressure level or concomitant use of other treatments at baseline. INTERPRETATION: Routine administration of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide to patients with type 2 diabetes was well tolerated and reduced the risks of major vascular events, including death. Although the confidence limits were wide, the results suggest that over 5 years, one death due to any cause would be averted among every 79 patients assigned active therapy.
BACKGROUND: Single-pill combinations (SPCs) of three low-dose antihypertensive drugs can improve hypertension control but are not widely available. A key issue for any combination product is the contribution of each component to efficacy and tolerability. This trial compared a new triple SPC called GMRx2, containing telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide, with dual combinations of components for efficacy and safety. METHODS: In this international, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults with hypertension receiving between zero and three antihypertensive drugs, with a screening systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 140-179 mm Hg (on no drugs) to 110-150 mm Hg (on three drugs). Participants were recruited from Australia, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, Sri Lanka, the UK, and the USA. In a 4-week active run-in, existing medications were switched to GMRx2 half dose (telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, and indapamide 1.25 mg). Participants were then randomly allocated (2:1:1:1) to continued GMRx2 half dose or to each possible dual combination of components at half doses (telmisartan 20 mg with amlodipine 2.5 mg, telmisartan 20 mg with indapamide 1.25 mg, or amlodipine 2.5 mg with indapamide 1.25 mg). At week 6, doses were doubled in all groups, unless there was a clinical contraindication. The primary efficacy outcome was mean change in home SBP from baseline to week 12, and the primary safety outcome was withdrawal of treatment due to an adverse event from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy outcomes included differences in clinic and home blood pressure levels and control rates. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04518293, and is completed. FINDINGS: The trial was conducted between July 9, 2021 and Sept 1, 2023. We randomly allocated 1385 participants to four groups: 551 to GMRx2, 276 to telmisartan-indapamide, 282 to telmisartan-amlodipine, and 276 to amlodipine-indapamide groups. The mean age was 59 years (SD 11), 712 (51%) participants self-reported as female and 673 (48.6%) male, and the mean clinic blood pressure at the screening visit was 142/85 mm Hg when taking an average of 1.6 blood pressure medications. Following the run-in on GMRx2 half dose, the mean clinic blood pressure level at randomisation was 133/81 mm Hg and the mean home blood pressure level was 129/78 mm Hg. At week 12, the mean home SBP was 126 mm Hg in the GMRx2 group, which was lower than for each of the dual combinations: -2.5 (95% CI -3.7 to -1.3, p<0.0001) versus telmisartan-indapamide, -5.4 (-6.8 to -4.1, p<0.0001) versus telmisartan-amlodipine, and -4.4 (-5.8 to -3.1, p<0.0001) versus amlodipine-indapamide. For the same comparisons, differences in clinic blood pressure at week 12 were 4.3/3.5 mm Hg, 5.6/3.7 mm Hg, and 6.3/4.5 mm Hg (all p<0.001). Clinic blood pressure control rate below 140/90 mm Hg at week 12 was superior with GMRx2 (74%) to with each dual combination (range 53-61%). Withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 11 (2%) participants in the GMRx2 group, four (1%) in telmisartan-indapamide, three (1%) in telmisartan-amlodipine, and four (1%) in amlodipine-indapamide, with none of the differences being statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: A novel low-dose SPC product of telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide provided clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure reduction compared with dual combinations and was well tolerated. This SPC provides a new therapeutic option for the management of hypertension and its use could result in a substantial improvement in blood pressure control in clinical practice.

Allisartan isoproxil (AI) is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker and be converted into the active substance EXP3174 in vivo. We evaluated the drug-drug interactions of AI and an indapamide sustained-release (Ind SR) preparation, as well as the pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of AI and Ind SR in healthy subjects. The trial was set up in 6 sequences and 3 cycles, and each cycle contained a 7-day washout period. Subjects received 3 different trial drugs (A, AI; B, Ind SR; C, AI + Ind SR) during 3 different cycles. Twenty-four subjects were enrolled in the clinical trial. Of these, 22 completed the study, 2 subjects dropped out due to adverse events (AEs). For subjects given AI alone or combined with Ind SR, the pharmacogenetic parameters C(max) and the geometric mean ratio of steady state (combined/single) of EXP3174 was 130%. The geometric mean ratio of area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval at steady state (combined/single use) was 144.5%. Therefore, the combination of Ind SR had an impact on the pharmacokinetics of AI. Then, the results indicated that the AI combination had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Ind SR. Serious AEs did not occur. The AEs in this clinical trial were the same as those for AI and Ind SR. Combined administration resulted in 2 cases (2 subjects) of Grade 3 hypotension and 1 case of Grade 3 hypotension with AI alone. Considering that this trial included healthy volunteers, the risk of hypotension was expected to be manageable.
BACKGROUND: Despite the overwhelming evidence and the established benefits of antihypertensive treatment, adherence to treatment remains low. OBJECTIVE: To assess the adherence to treatment with a perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine single-pill combination (SPC), its effectiveness on blood pressure (BP) reduction, as well as the safety and tolerability of this SPC over a 4-month treatment period. METHODS: This multicenter, non-interventional study prospectively included 2285 hypertensive patients on perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine SPC. The data were recorded at baseline, 1 month, and 4 months. RESULTS: Of the 2285 hypertensive patients included in the study, 50.5% were at "high/very high risk". Mean systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) decreased from 162.3 +/- 13.3/93.1 +/- 9.3 mmHg at baseline to 129.7 +/- 8.3/78.6 +/- 7.1 mmHg at 4 months (p < 0.001). Patients with higher baseline BP levels showed greater BP reduction. Patients with hypertension stages 1, 2, and 3 showed mean SBP/DBP reductions of 21.5/10.4 mmHg, 34.2/14.7 mmHg, and 51.2/22.5 mmHg, respectively, at study end (p < 0.001). Only 26 patients (1.1%) prematurely discontinued treatment (0.58% due to an adverse reaction or event). CONCLUSIONS: Perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine SPC decreased BP levels rapidly and significantly. The degree of BP reduction was associated with the severity of hypertension and/or with total cardiovascular risk at baseline. Simplifying the drug regimen by using this SPC improved adherence and showed excellent tolerability.
Low physical stability is the main reason limiting the widespread use of amorphous pharmaceuticals. One approach to overcome this problem is to mix these drugs with various excipients. In this study coamorphous drug-drug compositions of different molar ratios of ezetimib and indapamid (i.e., EZB 10:1 IDP, EZB 5:1 IDP, EZB 2:1 IDP, EZB 1:1 IDP and EZB 1:2 IDP) were prepared and investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our studies have shown that the easily recrystallizing ezetimib drug can be significantly stabilized in its amorphous form by using even a small amount of indapamid (8.8 wt %). DSC experiments indicate that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the tested mixtures changes with the drug concentration in accordance with the Gordon-Taylor equation. We also investigated the effect of indapamid on the molecular dynamics of the ezetimib. As a result it was found that, with increasing indapamid content, the molecular mobility of the binary drug-drug system is slowed down. Finally, using the XRD technique we examined the long-term physical stability of the investigated binary systems stored at room temperature. These measurements prove that low-molecular-weight compounds are able to significantly improve the physical stability of amorphous APIs.
The effect of indapamide, 2.5 mg daily, on blood pressure, electrolyte balance and the renin-aldosterone system was studied in 11 patients with essential hypertension. During indapamide treatment blood pressure decreased and the renin-aldosterone system was stimulated. A moderate hypokalaemia seen during indapamide treatment was not correlated to changes in plasma aldosterone concentration. Fractional excretion of potassium was unchanged during treatment, while renal calcium excretion was reduced. No effect on calcium in serum was observed.
Left ventricular function was evaluated non-invasively in hypertensive patients treated with indapamide by means of echographically determined velocity of circumferential fibre shortening (VCF). A statistically significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both the standing and supine position (P less than 0.001) and after exercise, systolic (P less than 0.001) diastolic (P less than 0.05) occurred but no alteration in left ventricular function was found. Blood lipids showed no change from pre-treatment levels. Serum uric acid demonstrated a significant elevation and serum potassium a significant fall but each remained within the normal range. Three patients required potassium supplementation. A significant rise in serum sodium and fall in serum chloride, both remaining within the normal range, occurred.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this non-interventional post-marketing clinical trial was to analyze the antihypertensive effect and safety of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide in the treatment of unregulated essential hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospective clinical trial included patients aged 20 to 75 years with essential hypertension and blood pressure values >/= 140/90 mmHg at baseline. On the basis of the investigator's decision, patients received 2 mg perindopril + 0.625 mg indapamide (group 2+0.625) or 4 mg perindopril + 1.25 mg indapamide (group 4+1.25). RESULTS: The study included 1173 patients (426 patients in group 2+0.625 and 747 patients in group 4+1.25) at 27 investigational centers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mean blood pressure values at baseline and visits after nine months were significantly higher in the 4+1.25 group compared to the 2+0.625 group. There was a significant drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups. The target values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, according to the European Society of Cardiology (2018), were reached after nine months of therapy by more than 80% of patients in the 2+0.625 group, and this number was significantly higher compared to the 4+1.25 group where more than 60% of patients reached target values. Newly diagnosed patients had a better response to therapy. The percentage of patients receiving additional antihypertensive therapy decreased by the end of the study. Age, gender and the existence of diabetes mellitus were identified as negative predictors of target blood pressure achievement. The therapy showed a good safety profile. CONCLUSION: A fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide was effective and safe in the treatment of unregulated essential hypertension.
Left ventricular hypertrophy develops in 36%-41% of hypertensive patients and independently predicts cardiovascular events and total mortality. Moreover, drug-induced reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM) correlates with improved prognosis. The optimal thiazide-type diuretic for reducing LVM is unknown. Evidence regarding potency, cardiovascular events, sodium, and potassium suggested the hypothesis that "CHIP" diuretics (CHlorthalidone, Indapamide, and Potassium-sparing diuretic/hydrochlorothiazide [PSD/HCTZ]) would reduce LVM more than HCTZ. Systematic searches of five databases were conducted. Among the 38 randomized trials, a 1% reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) predicted a 1% reduction in LVM, P = 0.00001. CHIP-HCTZ differences in reducing LVM differed across trials (ie, heterogeneity), making interpretation uncertain. However, among the 28 double-blind trials, heterogeneity was undetectable, and HCTZ reduced LVM (percent reduction [95% CI]) by -7.3 (-10.4, -4.2), P < 0.0001. CHIP diuretics surpassed HCTZ in reducing LVM: chlorthalidone -8.2 (-14.7, -1.6), P = 0.015; indapamide -7.5 (-12.7, -2.3), P = 0.005; and all CHIP diuretics combined -7.7 (-12.2, -3.1), P < 0.001. The comparison of PSD/HCTZ with HCTZ had low statistical power but favored PSD/HCTZ: -6.0 (-14.1, +2.1), P = 0.149. Thus, compared to HCTZ, CHIP diuretics had twice the effect on LVM. CHIP diuretics did not surpass HCTZ in reducing systolic or diastolic blood pressure: -0.3 (-5.0, +4.3) and -1.6 (-5.6, +2.4), respectively. The strength of evidence that CHIP diuretics surpass HCTZ for reducing LVM was high (GRADE criteria). In conclusion, these novel results have demonstrated that CHIP diuretics reduce LVM 2-fold more than HCTZ among hypertensive patients. Although generally related to LVM, blood pressure fails to explain the superiority of CHIP diuretics for reducing LVM.
BACKGROUND: Fluid and sodium overload are a common problem in critically ill patients. Frusemide may result in diuresis in excess of natriuresis. The addition of indapamide may achieve a greater natriuresis, and also circumvent some of the problems associated with frusemide. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of adding indapamide to frusemide on diuresis, natriuresis, creatinine clearance and serum electrolytes. METHODS: Fluid overloaded ICU patients were randomised to either intravenous frusemide (Group F) or intravenous frusemide and enteral indapamide (Group F + I). Comprehensive exclusion criteria were applied to address confounders. 24 hour urine was analysed for electrolytes and creatinine. Serum electrolytes were measured before and 24 hours after administration of diuretics. RESULTS: Forty patients (20 in each group) were included in the study. The groups were similar in their baseline characteristics. Over the 24 h study period, patients in Group F + I, had a larger natriuresis (P = 0.01), chloride loss (P = 0.01) and kaliuresis (P = 0.047). Patients in Group F + I also had a greater 24 hour urinary creatinine clearance (P = 0.01). The 24 hour urine volume and fluid balance was similar between the groups. Patients in Group F had an increase in serum sodium (P = 0.04), while patients in Group F + I had a decrease in both serum chloride (P = 0.01) and peripheral oedema (P < 0.001) during the study duration. CONCLUSION: In fluid overloaded ICU patients, addition of indapamide to frusemide led to a greater natriuresis and creatinine clearance. Such a strategy might be utilised in optimising sodium balance in ICU patients.
A robust and rapid UPLC-MS/MS method has been developed, optimized and validated for determination of amlodipine (AML), indapamide (IND) and perindopril (PRN) in human plasma. A positive electrospray ionization mode was used in a Xevo TQD LC-MS/MS instrument. A single sample preparation step using extraction technique was applied to extract the three analytes from plasma samples. There was no need to extract indapamide from blood samples in a further step. Extraction of the three drugs and internal standards was done using a solvent mixture composed of methyl tertiary butyl ether, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. The prepared samples were analyzed using an Acquity UPLC HSS C(18) (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mum) column. Ammonium acetate and methanol, pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, were used as a mobile phase. Method validation was done as per the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Linearity was achieved in the range of 0.2-15 ng/ml for AML, 0.5-50 ng/ml for IND and 0.5-120 ng/ml for PRN. Accuracy and precision were estimated and found to be within the acceptable ranges. The rapid chromatography permits analysis of many samples per batch, making the method suitable for clinical and pharmacokinetic investigations. The developed and validated method was applied to estimate AML, IND, and PRN in a fasting bioequivalence study in healthy human volunteers.
BACKGROUND: A low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide may effectively reduce blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, but some factors related to study design might have contributed to the between-group differences in the rate of reduction of BP observed in some trials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically assess the efficacy and safety profiles (through review of randomized, controlled trials) of the fixed, low-dose combination perindopril 2 mg and indapamide 0.625 mg given as 1 tablet daily as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (1966-April 2003), EMBASE (1980-March 2003), BIOSIS (1999-December 2002), and the Cochrane Library, using the medical subject headings with the search terms perindopril, indapamide, hypertension, randomized controlled trials, randomly, random, randomization, perindopril-indapamide, essential hypertension, and primary hypertension. Additional articles were obtained from the reference lists of relevant reviews and papers. RESULTS: We reviewed 11 trials (5936 individuals). In 5 studies of perindopril-indapamide versus placebo, the between-group weighted mean differences (WMDs) for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively) favored perindopril-indapamide (SBP, -9.03 mm Hg [95% CI, -9.54 to -8.52]; DBP, -5.09 mm Hg [95% Cl, -5.42 to -4.77]; both P < 0.01 for z score for overall effect). In 6 studies of perindopril-indapamide versus routine antihypertensives, the between-group WMDs for SBP and DBP favored perindopril-indapamide (SBP, -3.72 mm Hg [95% CI, -7.11 to 0.33], P = 0.03 for z score for overall effect; DBP, -1.71 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.27 to -1.16], P < 0.01 for z score for overall effect). Five studies compared perindopril-indapamide and placebo; in the remaining 3 studies, which assessed perindopril-indapamide versus routine antihypertensives, the between-group WMDs for SBP and DBP favored perindopril-indapamide (SBP, -4.00 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.54 to -1.47], P < 0.01; DBP, -1.02 mm Hg [95% CI, -1.73 to -0.31], P < 0.01). Adverse events and withdrawals were not significantly different between perindopril-indapamide, placebo, or routine antihypertensive drugs. CONCLUSION: The studies in our analysis consistently demonstrated that a fixed, low-dose perindopril-indapamide combination has a favorable safety profile and may be efficacious as first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
OBJECTIVES: To assess, using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), the antihypertensive efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and indapamide 2.5 mg given as a monotherapy over 3 months to black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. DESIGN: Single-centre, prospective, randomised open pilot study in three phases: (i) 1-week drug-free washout period; (ii) 2-week placebo run-in phase; and (iii) 3-month prospective open-label active treatment period. RESULTS: Forty-two black patients with mean daytime diastolic BP (DBP) > or = 90 mmHg and < or = 115 mmHg (mean age 57 +/- 11 years, 28 women/14 men) were enrolled into the study. Overall, a profound and sustained BP reduction was achieved with indapamide at 3 months (N = 20). The 24-hour BP decreased from 150 +/- 17/94 +/- 6 mmHg to 130 +/- 19/82 +/- 9 mmHg (P < 0.0001 for systolic BP (SBP) and DBP at 3 months versus baseline); the mean daytime BP decreased from 155 +/- 15/98 +/- 6 mmHg to 134 +/- 18/87 +/- 10 mmHg (P < 0.0001 for SBP and DBP at 3 months versus baseline). The overall control (mean daytime DBP < 90 mmHg) and response (decrease in daytime DBP > or = 10 mmHg) rates achieved with indapamide were 10/20 (50%) and 13/20 (65%), respectively. In contrast, monotherapy with hydrochlorothiazide resulted in more modest BP reduction and control and response rates at 3 months (N = 22). The 24-hour BP decreased from 147 +/- 14/94 +/- 7 mmHg to 139 +/- 19/88 +/- 2 mmHg (P < 0.05 for DBP at 3 months versus baseline, P = NS for SBP); the mean daytime BP decreased from 151 +/- 14/98 +/- 5 mmHg to 144 +/- 16/93 +/- 10 mmHg (P < 0.05 for DBP at 3 months versus baseline, P = NS for SBP). The corresponding control and response rates were 7/22 (32%) and 8/22 (36%). Both hydrocholorothiazide and indapamide caused significant hypokalaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with indapamide is associated with greater BP reduction and control and response rates than monotherapy with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide and may be an appropriate choice of antihypertensive diuretic therapy in black South African patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
The binding of indapamide to isolated serum proteins and erythrocytes was studied in order to understand its blood distribution. In serum, indapamide was mainly bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein with a high affinity (K = 73.4/mM), and to albumin and lipoproteins. Indapamide was bound to erythrocytes via a saturable process with a high affinity (K = 385/mM and N = 57 microM for an hematocrit value of 0.48), and erythrocytes were the main binding component in blood (more than 80% of indapamide was associated to erythrocytes in blood). The binding to serum proteins affected indapamide distribution in blood, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was shown to be the more effective protein in decreasing the amount of indapamide associated to erythrocytes.
