OBJECTIVES: This narrative review summarizes literature on pharmaceutical fentanyl's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion patterns to inform research on illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). RESULTS: Fentanyl is highly lipophilic, lending itself to rapid absorption by highly perfused tissues (including the brain) before redistributing from these tissues to muscle and fat. Fentanyl is eliminated primarily by metabolism and urinary excretion of metabolites (norfentanyl and other minor metabolites). Fentanyl has a long terminal elimination, with a documented secondary peaking phenomenon that can manifest as "fentanyl rebound." Clinical implications in overdose (respiratory depression, muscle rigidity, and "wooden chest syndrome") and opioid use disorder treatment (subjective effects, withdrawal, and buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal) are discussed. The authors highlight research gaps derived from differences in medicinal fentanyl studies and IMF use patterns, including that medicinal fentanyl studies are largely conducted with persons who were opioid-naive, anesthetized, or had severe chronic pain and that IMF use is characterized by supratherapeutic doses and frequent and sustained administration patterns, as well as adulteration with other substances and/or fentanyl analogs. CONCLUSIONS: This review reexamines information yielded from decades of medicinal fentanyl research and applies elements of the pharmacokinetic profile to persons with IMF exposure. In persons who use drugs, peripheral accumulation of fentanyl may be leading to prolonged exposure. More focused research on the pharmacology of fentanyl in persons using IMF is warranted.
Opioid overdoses, many of which are attributed to use of illicit fentanyl, are currently one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. Although fentanyl has been used safely for decades in clinical settings, the widespread use of illicit fentanyl is a recent phenomenon. Starting in 2013, illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs began to appear on the streets. These substances were added to or sold as heroin, often unbeknownst to the user. Because fentanyl is so potent, only small amounts are needed to produce pharmacological effects, but the margin between safe and toxic doses is narrow. Surprisingly little is known about the exact signaling mechanisms underlying fentanyl-related respiratory depression or the effectiveness of naloxone in reversing this effect. Similarly, little is known about the ability of treatment medications such as buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone to reduce illicit fentanyl use. The present article reviews the receptor, preclinical and clinical pharmacology of fentanyl, and how its pharmacology may predict the effectiveness of currently approved medications for treating illicit fentanyl use.
Morphine and fentanyl are among the most used opioid drugs that confer analgesia and unwanted side effects through both G protein and arrestin signaling pathways of mu-opioid receptor (muOR). Here, we report structures of the human muOR-G protein complexes bound to morphine and fentanyl, which uncover key differences in how they bind the receptor. We also report structures of muOR bound to TRV130, PZM21, and SR17018, which reveal preferential interactions of these agonists with TM3 side of the ligand-binding pocket rather than TM6/7 side. In contrast, morphine and fentanyl form dual interactions with both TM3 and TM6/7 regions. Mutations at the TM6/7 interface abolish arrestin recruitment of muOR promoted by morphine and fentanyl. Ligands designed to reduce TM6/7 interactions display preferential G protein signaling. Our results provide crucial insights into fentanyl recognition and signaling of muOR, which may facilitate rational design of next-generation analgesics.
Deaths from opioid use are increasing in the US, with a growing proportion due to synthetic opioids. Until 2013, sporadic outbreaks of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs contaminating the heroin supply caused some deaths in heroin users. Since then, fentanyl has caused deaths in every state and fentanyl and its analogs have completely infiltrated the North American heroin supply. In 2014, the first illicit pills containing fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and other novel synthetic opioids such as U-47700 were detected. These pills, which look like known opioids or benzodiazepines, have introduced synthetic opioids to more unsuspecting customers. As soon as these drugs are regulated by various countries, new compounds quickly appear on the market, making detection difficult and the number of cases likely underreported. Standard targeted analytical techniques such as GC-MS (gas chromatography mass spectrometry) and LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) can detect these drugs, but novel compound identification is aided by nontargeted testing with LC-HRMS (liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry). Fentanyl, fentanyl analogs and other novel synthetic opioids are all full agonists of varying potencies at the mu-opioid receptor, leading to typical clinical effects of miosis and respiratory and central nervous system depression. Due to their high affinity for mu-opioid receptors, larger doses of naloxone are required to reverse the effects than are commonly used. Synthetic opioids are an increasingly major public health threat requiring vigilance from multiple fields including law enforcement, government agencies, clinical chemists, pharmacists, and physicians, to name a few, in order to stem its tide. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Designer Drugs and Legal Highs.'
BACKGROUND: The USA has recently entered the third decade of the opioid epidemic. Opioid overdose deaths reached a new record of over 74,000 in a 12-month period ending April 2021. Naloxone is the primary opioid overdose reversal agent, but concern has been raised that naloxone is not efficacious against the pervasive illicit high potency opioids (i.e., fentanyl and fentanyl analogs). METHODS: This narrative review provides a brief overview of naloxone, including its history and pharmacology, and the evidence regarding naloxone efficacy against fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. We also highlight current advances in overdose treatments and technologies that have been tested in humans. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The argument that naloxone is not efficacious against fentanyl and fentanyl analogs rests on case studies, retrospective analyses of community outbreaks, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. No well-controlled studies have been conducted to test this argument, and the current literature provides limited evidence to suggest that naloxone is ineffective against fentanyl or fentanyl analog overdose. Rather a central concern for treating fentanyl/fentanyl analog overdose is the rapidity of overdose onset and the narrow window for treatment. It is also difficult to determine if other non-opioid substances are contributing to a drug overdose, for which naloxone is not an effective treatment. Alternative pharmacological approaches that are currently being studied in humans include other opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., nalmefene), respiratory stimulants, and buprenorphine. None of these approaches target polysubstance overdose and only one novel approach (a wearable naloxone delivery device) would address the narrow treatment window.
