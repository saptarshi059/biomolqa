Among patients receiving thiazides for hypertension, there was no reliable predictor of those who would develop significant hypokalemia (a decrease in serum potassium of at least 0.5 mEq. per L). Eighty percent of patients required 60 mEq. of potassium chloride 10 percent elixir daily for successful treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia. Foods containing potassium or organic anion compounds of potassium are not useful in this potentially dangerous situation.
Loop diuretics, including torsemide, furosemide, bumetanide, and piretanide, act by inhibiting the sodium-potassium-chloride (Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-)) cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle within the nephron. This mechanism is pivotal in managing fluid retention associated with conditions such as heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. A comprehensive understanding of how these diuretics uniquely target this transporter provides crucial insights into effectively addressing fluid overload across diverse clinical conditions.
The first diagnosed cases of the surdo-cardiac syndrome are presented. The effect on the ECG of exercise, of digitalis treatment, of intramuscular injection of atropine and of intravenous injection of potassium chloride solution were studied. ECGs taken during attacks of syncope showed that the attacks are caused either by ventricular fibrillation or by ventricular standstill.
Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.
The usual metabolic derangement in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is metabolic acidosis, with an increase in the anion gap because of increased ketoacids and lactate. However, diabetic ketoalkalosis may occasionally be encountered, the prominent clinical feature of which is vomiting, with depletion of potassium, chloride, and hydrogen ions. Self-medication with absorbabe alkali may also contribute to the alkalosis. It would be dangerous to treat hyperlgycemic patients with alkali if their condition is ketoalkalosis instead of ketoacidosis.
