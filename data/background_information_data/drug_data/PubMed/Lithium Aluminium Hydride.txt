Ruthenium complexes offer potential reduced toxicity compared to current platinum anticancer drugs. 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrisoquinoline amino alcohol ligands were synthesised, characterised and coordinated to an organometallic Ru(II) centre. These complexes were evaluated for activity against the cancer cell lines MCF-7, A549 and MDA-MB-231 as well as for toxicity in the normal cell line MDBK. They were observed to be moderately active against only the MCF-7 cells with the best IC(5)(0) value of 34 muM for the cis-diastereomeric complex C4. They also displayed excellent selectivity by being relatively inactive against the normal MDBK cell line with SI values ranging from 2.3 to 7.4.
BACKGROUND AND AIM: [C]methyl iodide ([C]CH3I) is the most extensively used methylation agent for the preparation of a majority of C-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, which is commonly produced by the wet method and the gas-phase method. On account of the complexity of the gas-phase method, a simple automated synthesis of [C]methyl bromide ([C]CH3Br) as an analog of [C]CH3I is derived by the wet method in this study. Radiosynthesis of L-[S-methyl-C]methionine (MET), L-[S-methyl-C]cysteine (MCYS), [N-methyl-C]choline (CH), [C]methyl triflate ([C]CH3OSO2CF3), and [C]-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (CFT) by methylation reaction with [C]CH3Br, and PET imaging of patients are also described. METHODS: The preparation of [C]CH3Br by a one-pot wet method involved the following steps: reduction of [C]carbon dioxide with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) solution, treatment with hydrobromic acid, and distillation of [C]CH3Br under continuous nitrogen flow. [C]methylation of L-homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride, L-cysteine, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, silver triflate, and nor-beta-CFT as precursors with [C]CH3Br and purification with Sep-Pak cartridges gave MET, MCYS, CH, [C]CH3OSO2CF3, and CFT, respectively. In addition, PET imaging of brain cancer and Parkinson's disease was carried out. RESULTS: The uncorrected radiochemical yield of [C]CH3Br was (37.8+/-2.5%) based on [C]carbon dioxide within a total synthesis time of 10 min and the radiochemical purity of [C]CH3Br was greater than 95%. The uncorrected yields of MET, MCYS, CH, [C]CH3OSO2CF3, and CFT were 70.1+/-0.5%, 70.2+/-2.3%, 60.3+/-1.8%, 95.1+/-2.2%, and 60.1+/-1.5% (from [C]CH3OSO2CF3) within a total synthesis time of 2, 2, 5, 1, and 8 min, respectively. The radiochemical purity of MET, MCYS, CH, [C]CH3OSO2CF3, and CFT was more than 95%. Good PET images in the patients are obtained. CONCLUSION: Automated synthesis of [C]CH3Br can be done by the wet method on the commercial [C]CH3I synthesizer. [C]CH3Br can be used for a [C]methylation reaction to produce C-labeled tracers for clinical PET imaging.
Two series of new benzoxazepines substituted with different alkyl amino ethyl chains were synthesized comprising synthetic steps of inter and intramolecular Mitsunobu reaction, lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) reduction, debenzylation, bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The present study investigates the effect of a tyrosine-based benzoxazepine derivative in human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and in breast cancer animal model. The anti-proliferative effect of 15a on MCF-7 cells was associated with G1 cell-cycle arrest. This G1 growth arrest was followed by apoptosis as 15a dose dependently increased phosphatidylserine exposure, PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation that are hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, 15a activated components of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis characterized by activation of caspase-8 and -9, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increase in Bax/Bcl2 ratio. However, use of selective caspase inhibitors revealed that the caspase-8-dependent pathway is the major contributor to 15a-induced apoptosis. Compound 15a also significantly reduced the growth of MCF-7 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice. Together, 15a could serve as a base for the development of a new group of effective breast cancer therapeutics.
We here report the synthesis of ethylene glycol N-interlinked imipramine dimers of various lengths from the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine via an amide coupling reaction followed by reduction with lithium aluminium hydride. The target molecules were found to be potent inhibitors of cellular viability while inducing cell type specific death mechanisms in three cancer cell lines including a highly chemoresistant Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. Basic amine analogues were found to be important for increased potency. Imipramine and desipramine were also tested for apoptotic activity and were found to be much less active than the novel dimeric compounds. Imipramine dimers were only found to be moderate inhibitors of the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) having IC(50) values in the micromolar region whilst the induction of cell death occurred independently of hSERT expression. These results demonstrate the potential of newly designed and synthesised imipramines derivatives for use against malignant cells, including those resistant to standard chemotherapy.
The urinary excretion of fucose-containing material was found to be highly increased in a patient with fucosidosis type 2. Three structurally related compounds, a disaccharide and two glycoasparagines, were isolated from the urine. The isolation procedure included ultrafiltration, gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25, preparative zone electrophoresis and paper chromatography. From structural studies including optical rotation, sugar analysis, methylation analysis, ninhydrin degradation, reduction with lithium aluminium hydride and partial hydrolysis, the following structures were deduced: formula (see text), where Fucp is fucopyranose, Manp is mannopyranose, Galcp is galactopyranose, GlcNAcp is 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranose and Asn is asparagine. The yields of these compounds were 1.7, 40, and 6 mg/l, respectively. The origin of the disaccharide and the two glycoasparagines is probably the core region of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains.
