A new synthetic protocol for the LiAlH(4)-promoted reduction of non-activated aziridines under microwave conditions was developed. Thus, ring opening of 2-(acetoxymethyl)aziridines provided the corresponding beta-amino alcohols, which were then used as eligible substrates in the synthesis of 5-methylmorpholin-2-ones via condensation with glyoxal in THF. The same procedure was applied for the preparation of novel 5(R)- and 5(S)-methylmorpholin-2-ones starting from the corresponding enantiopure 2-(hydroxymethyl)aziridines. Additionally, 2-(methoxymethyl)- and 2-(phenoxymethyl)aziridines were treated with LiAlH(4) under microwave irradiation, giving rise to either isopropylamines or 1-methoxypropan-2-amines depending on the reaction conditions.
The reactivity of 4-aryl-1-(2-chloroethyl)azetidin-2-ones and 4-aryl-1-(3-bromopropyl)azetidin-2-ones with regard to lithium aluminium hydride has been evaluated for the first time. 4-Aryl-1-(2-chloroethyl)azetidin-2-ones were transformed into novel 1-(1-aryl-3-hydroxypropyl)aziridines through an unprecedented conversion of beta-lactams into 2,3-unsubstituted aziridine derivatives. Unexpectedly, 4-aryl-1-(3-bromopropyl)azetidin-2-ones underwent dehalogenation towards 3-aryl-3-(N-propylamino)propan-1-ols upon treatment with LiAlH(4). 1-(1-Aryl-3-hydroxypropyl)aziridines were further elaborated by means of ring opening reactions using benzyl bromide in acetonitrile towards 3-aryl-3-[N-benzyl-N-(2-bromoethyl)amino]propan-1-ols and using aluminium(iii) chloride in diethyl ether, affording 3-aryl-3-[N-(2-chloroethyl)amino]propan-1-ols.
An off-line technique is described for the preparation of H(2) from water prior to analysis of delta(2)H by dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry. H(2) is produced from sample water by reaction with LiAlH(4). This provides a rapid and inexpensive method for the analysis of delta(2)H in small (10 microL) samples of water. Precision was +/- 4.2 to 8.0 (1sigma(n), n = 8) delta(2)H(VSMOW) for samples between 428 and 1500 delta(2)H(VSMOW), +/- 14.5 delta(2)H(VSMOW) for water enriched to 3750 delta(2)H(VSMOW) and +/- 26.0 delta(2)H(VSMOW) for water enriched to 6100 delta(2)H(VSMOW). Accuracy was +/- 1.1 to 4.2 delta(2)H(VSMOW) for water standards from natural abundance to 1000 delta(2)H(VSMOW) (the highest enrichment at which water of accepted delta(2)H is currently available). This method for delta(2)H determination is most appropriate for use with small (<50 microL) samples of high delta(2)H enrichment such as those produced from doubly labelled water studies of small animals. The levels of measurement precision of delta(2)H would contribute 2.6-3.8% to the precision error in estimates of small animal energy expenditure made using the doubly labelled water technique when duplicate analyses are performed.
