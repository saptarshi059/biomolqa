Speedel Pharma is developing aliskiren (formerly CGP-60536), a renin inhibitor under license from Novartis, for the potential treatment of several cardiovascular disorders. By October 2001, a phase IIb study in hypertension had been completed, and phase III studies for this indication were anticipated for 2002; at this time, phase II studies in congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure were ongoing.
The first renin inhibitor, aliskiren, will soon enter the clinical arena. This review summarizes the potential differences between renin inhibitors and the currently existing blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [ie, the ACE inhibitors and the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists], taking also into consideration the recently discovered (pro)renin receptor. This receptor not only activates the inactive precursor of renin, prorenin, but it also exerts direct renin/prorenin-induced effects, independently of angiotensin. The review ends with a brief overview of the available (pre)clinical aliskiren data and a description of its safety profile.
The first evidence of the existence of renin was presented over 100 years ago. However, the importance of renin and the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease was only fully realized in the 1970s. It was another 20 years before the first inhibitors of renin were available for clinical research. Here, we describe the discovery and development of aliskiren, an orally active renin inhibitor, which became the first drug in its class to receive regulatory approval. In 2007, it was approved for the treatment of hypertension by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.
PURPOSE: The pharmacology, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects and toxicity, drug interactions, and dosage and administration of aliskiren as well as safety and economic issues related to its use are reviewed. SUMMARY: Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents, direct renin inhibitors, that act by blocking the rate- limiting step of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS). It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for use as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives. Clinical studies comparing aliskiren monotherapy with placebo indicated a dose-dependent reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). Greater reductions in BP have been achieved when aliskiren was used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or an angiotensin-receptor blocker. The most common adverse effects reported in clinical trials were headache, fatigue, dizziness, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis. Aliskiren has not been studied in patients with moderate renal dysfunction; as a RAAS-acting drug, it should be prescribed for such patients only with caution. CONCLUSION: Aliskiren at a dosage of 150 or 300 mg daily may be a good option for control of mild-to-moderate hypertension in patients with or without diabetes in whom first-line antihypertensives have failed to adequately control BP; comparative studies with other antihypertensives are needed to determine which patients can most benefit from aliskiren therapy.
Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, is the first in a new class of drugs interfering with the renin angiotensin system. Aliskiren was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2007, and in Europe in August 2007 for the treatment of hypertension (marketed as Tekturna and Rasilez, respectively). Several clinical trials demonstrated effective blood pressure reduction due to aliskiren treatment. Whether aliskiren exhibits morbidity and mortality benefits for patients beyond its blood pressure reduction capability, can only be judged after realization of comparative long-term clinical trials. Furthermore, it remains to be seen, whether the use of aliskiren will be indicated for treatment of additional diseases, as it was the case for other inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system. In fact, recent and ongoing clinical trials regarding heart failure and diabetic nephropathy demonstrated first beneficial effects of aliskiren in these conditions (reduction of urinary albumin/creatinine-ratio and NTproBNP, respectively).
