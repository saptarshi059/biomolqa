Analogues of the antimalarial alkaloid nitidine have been prepared with high potency against both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. Simple modifications, using an established synthetic route, resulted in an analogue with IC(50) below 5ng/mL against a chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. falciparum. N-Ethylethoxidine had IC(50) below 30ng/mL against both chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum.
High performance liquid chromatography was employed to quantify chloroquine in biological fluids and tissues in a death attributed to chloroquine overdose. The blood concentration of chloroquine was 16.71 mg/l. Results are discussed in the light of the existing literature.
The development of chloroquine as an antimalarial drug and the subsequent evolution of drug-resistant Plasmodium strains had major impacts on global public health in the 20th century. In P. falciparum, the cause of the most lethal human malaria, chloroquine resistance is linked to multiple mutations in PfCRT, a protein that likely functions as a transporter in the parasite's digestive vacuole membrane. Rapid diagnostic assays for PfCRT mutations are already employed as surveillance tools for drug resistance. Here, we review recent field studies that support the central role of PfCRT mutations in chloroquine resistance. These studies suggest chloroquine resistance arose in > or = 4 distinct geographic foci and substantiate an important role of immunity in the outcomes of resistant infections after chloroquine treatment. P. vivax, which also causes human malaria, appears to differ from P. falciparum in its mechanism of chloroquine resistance. Investigation of the resistance mechanisms and of the role of immunity in therapeutic outcomes will support new approaches to drugs that can take the place of chloroquine or augment its efficiency.
We report the case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with bilateral progressive deterioration in vision after taking chloroquine for severe rheumatoid arthritis for 10 years. She was found to have a bull's eye pattern of depigmentation in the macula of both eyes. Despite cessation of chloroquine, her vision did not improve. The clinical presentation of chloroquine retinopathy is discussed, along with the importance of scheduled eye examination for individuals taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
The malaria parasite's development of resistance to the drug chloroquine is a major threat to world health. A protein likely to be involved in chloroquine resistance has recently been identified; this discovery is important, but raises as many questions as it answers.
