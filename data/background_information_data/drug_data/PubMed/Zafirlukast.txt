Leukotriene-receptor antagonists are the first novel class of antiasthma drugs to become available over the past three decades. They have an unique profile in that they are a hybrid of an anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator drug, and they can be taken as a tablet once or twice daily. The published data with leukotriene-receptor antagonists such as montelukast or zafirlukast show good antiasthmatic activity over a wide spectrum of asthma severity either as monotherapy or with inhaled steroids. Another potential spin-off of leukotriene-receptor antagonists is that they also seem to be effective in treating allergic rhinitis, which commonly coexists in patients with asthma. Here I overview the clinical pharmacology of leukotriene antagonists and appraise the published data from clinical trials, and look at the appropriate position of these agents in asthma management guidelines.
BACKGROUND: Since the 1960s, silicone implants have been successfully used for breast augmentation and reconstruction. However, safety issues regarding the use of silicone have led to a moratorium by the US Food and Drug Administration between 1992 and 2006. DESIGN: To date, although the moratorium has been removed and women overwhelmingly prefer silicone over saline implants, local and systemic adverse effects still remain a concern. RESULTS: Silicone-elicited inflammatory fibro-proliferative response and capsular contracture is irrefutable. Studies on silicone breast implants have not supported a relationship to carcinogenesis, whereas that to autoimmunity mainly to nondefined autoimmune phenomena seems very plausible. These silicone-related autoimmune adverse events termed 'siliconosis' are probably limited to a small minority of implanted patients. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors, such as characteristic environmental exposure and/or genetic predisposition, still require further elucidation. Similarly to antibacterial agents, texturized implants and Zafirlukast that were found to be beneficial in inhibiting fibro-proliferative response and capsular contracture, elucidating autoimmune-related risk factors might subsequently enable physicians to accurately predict long-term health status of silicone implant recipients.
Churg-Strauss syndrome is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis involving small and medium-sized vessels. Classic features include asthma and hypereosinophilia. Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) are detected in about 40% of patients. Churg-Strauss syndrome has been reported in patients receiving leukotriene modifiers for asthma, in particular, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) (montelukast, zafirlukast or pranlukast). Clinical manifestations cases do not differ in these cases from those in Churg-Strauss syndrome without antileukotriene exposure. It is increasingly less likely that LTRA is the direct cause of this syndrome in those patients, although this hypothesis has not been completely ruled out. In many patients, LTRA treatment is prescribed because of worsening asthma, which is an early sign of Churg-Strauss syndrome. LTRA for asthma patients should be prescribed with great care, especially in cases of atypical or rapidly aggravated asthma. The onset of Churg-Strauss syndrome in patients treated with LTRA usually requires that they stop this treatment. Prescription of LTRA In patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome should be discussed with specialists.
BACKGROUND: The benefits and harms of adding antileukotrienes to H(1) antihistamines (AHs) for the management of urticaria (hives, itch, and/or angioedema) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to systematically synthesize the treatment outcomes of antileukotrienes in combination with AHs versus AHs alone for acute and chronic urticaria. METHODS: As part of updating American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters urticaria guidelines, we searched Medline, Embase, Central, LILACS, WPRIM, IBECS, ICTRP, CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, US Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines Agency databases from inception to December 18, 2023, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating antileukotrienes and AHs versus AHs alone in patients with urticaria. Paired reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Random effects models pooled effect estimates for urticaria activity, itch, wheal, sleep, quality of life, and harms. The GRADE approach informed certainty of evidence ratings. The study was registered at the Open Science Framework (osf.io/h2bfx/). RESULTS: Thirty-four RCTs enrolled 3324 children and adults. Compared to AHs alone, the combination of a leukotriene receptor antagonist with AHs probably modestly reduces urticaria activity (mean difference, -5.04; 95% confidence interval, -6.36 to -3.71; 7-day urticaria activity score) with moderate certainty. We made similar findings for itch and wheal severity as well as quality of life. Adverse events were probably not different between groups (moderate certainty); however, no RCT reported on neuropsychiatric adverse events. CONCLUSION: Among patients with urticaria, adding leukotriene receptor antagonists to AHs probably modestly improves urticaria activity with little to no increase in overall adverse events. The added risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events in this population with leukotriene receptor antagonists is small and uncertain.
Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, despite many advances being made in recent decades. Changes in the tumor microenvironment, including dysregulated immunity, may contribute to carcinogenesis and cancer progression. The cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) pathway is involved in several signal pathways, having various functions in different tissues. We summarized major findings of studies about the roles of the CysLT pathway in cancer. Many in vitro studies suggested the roles of CysLTs in cell survival/proliferation via CysLT(1) receptor (CysLT(1)R). CysLT(1)R antagonism decreased cell vitality and induced cell death in several types of cancer cells, such as colorectal, urological, breast, lung and neurological malignancies. CysLTs were also associated with multidrug resistance of cancer, and CysLT(1)R antagonism might reverse chemoresistance. Some animal studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of CysLT(1)R antagonist in inhibiting tumorigenesis and progression of some cancer types, particularly colorectal cancer and lung cancer. The expression of CysLT(1)R was shown in various cancer tissues, particularly colorectal cancer and urological malignancies, and higher expression was associated with a poorer prognosis. The chemo-preventive effects of CysLT(1)R antagonists were demonstrated in two large retrospective cohort studies. In summary, the roles of the CysLT pathway in cancer have been delineated, whereas further studies are still warranted.
