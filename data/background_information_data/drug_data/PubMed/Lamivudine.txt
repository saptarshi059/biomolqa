BACKGROUND: Acute hepatitis B infection is associated with severe liver disease and chronic sequelae in some cases. The purpose of this review was to determine the efficacy of nucleoside analogues (NA) (lamivudine versus entecavir) compared to placebo or no intervention for treating acute primary HBV infection. METHODS: A meta-analysis for drug intervention was performed, following a fixed-effect model. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized studies that evaluated the outcomes of NA in acute hepatitis B infection were included. The following outcomes were considered: virological cure (PCR negative), elimination of acute infection (seroconversion of HBsAg), mortality, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Five trials with 627 adult participants with severe acute hepatitis B defined by biochemical and serologic parameters were included. Virological cure did not favor any intervention: OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.7 (p = 0.90), I2 = 58%. Seroconversion of HBsAg to negative favored placebo/standard-of-care compared to lamivudine: OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.9 (p = 0.02), I2 = 31%. The only trial that compared entecavir and lamivudine favored entecavir over lamivudine (OR: 3.64, 95% CI 1.31-10.13; 90 participants). Adverse events were mild. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence that NA obtain superior efficacy compared with placebo/standard-of-care in patients with acute viral hepatitis, based on low quality evidence.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) among treatment-naive and virologically suppressed treatment-experienced individuals in the multicentre cohort of the Spanish HIV/AIDS Research Network (CoRIS) during the years 2018-2021. METHODS: We used multivariable regression models to compare viral suppression (VS) [HIV RNA viral load (VL) <50 copies/mL] and the change in CD4 cell counts at 24 and 48 (+/-12) weeks after initiation with dolutegravir/lamivudine or other first-line ART regimens. RESULTS: We included 2160 treatment-naive subjects, among whom 401 (18.6%) started with dolutegravir/lamivudine. The remaining subjects started bictegravir (BIC)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) (n = 949, 43.9%), DTG + FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (n = 282, 13.1%), DTG/3TC/abacavir (ABC) (n = 255, 11.8%), darunavir (DRV)/cobicistat(COBI)/FTC/TAF (n = 147, 6.8%) and elvitegravir (EVG)/COBI/FTC/TAF (n = 126, 5.8%). At 24 and 48 weeks after starting dolutegravir/lamivudine, 91.4% and 93.8% of the subjects, respectively, achieved VS. The probability of achieving VS with dolutegravir/lamivudine was not significantly different compared with any other regimen at 24 or 48 weeks, with the exception of a lower chance of achieving VS at 24 weeks for DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF (adjusted OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.30-0.74) compared with dolutegravir/lamivudine.For the analysis of treatment-experienced virally suppressed subjects we included 1456 individuals who switched to dolutegravir/lamivudine, among whom 97.4% and 95.5% maintained VS at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. During the first 48 weeks after dolutegravir/lamivudine initiation, 1.0% of treatment-naive and 1.5% of treatment-experienced subjects discontinued dolutegravir/lamivudine due to an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: In this large multicentre cohort, effectiveness and tolerability of dolutegravir/lamivudine were high among treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects.
We report a case of a 62-yr-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis who developed hepatic decompensation after being started on lamivudine requiring liver transplantation. Decompensated liver disease while on lamivudine has been previously reported on two occasions, both HIV coinfected patients on a combination of nucleoside analogues. Our patient is alive and well nearly 2 yr after successful liver transplantation.
: Emtricitabine is structurally similar to lamivudine, which has been associated with red cell aplasia. We describe four patients with severe anaemia presenting soon after starting emtricitabine-containing antiretroviral therapy. Bone marrow biopsy in three patients confirmed red cell aplasia. Anaemia resolved after emtricitabine withdrawal in three patients, one patient died, and anaemia recurred on rechallenge in one patient whose anaemia persisted on lamivudine, resolving when this was stopped, suggesting a possible cross-reaction between lamivudine and emtricitabine.
Membranous glomerulopathy is a well-recognized extrahepatic manifestation of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The authors report two cases of HBV-related nephrotic syndrome treated with lamivudine. A 46-year-old Chinese man had a hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion along with improvement in his nephrotic syndrome after lamivudine therapy. Two years after treatment was discontinued, a reactivation of HBV was successfully treated again with lamivudine. A 44-year-old Chinese woman, who was intolerant of interferon, was treated with lamivudine for 15 months without a virological response. However, two years after completing lamivudine, her nephrotic syndrome resolved. Implications for the treatment of HBV-related glomerulopathy and a review of the literature are presented.
