Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare complication of the intravascular application of a contrast agent. CIE can be manifested by headache, cortical blindness, consciousness disorders, seizures, or focal neurological deficit. Neurological symptoms are typically transient with temporary abnormal findings on a brain scan. Urgent neuroimaging is important to obtain the correct diagnosis, especially in cases that require an acute management and treatment. We present a case of CIE after a digital subtraction angiography of the vertebral arteries in the patient with a symptomatic pre-occlusive stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery (Ref. 36).

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale vesicles secreted into the extracellular space by all cell types, including neurons and astrocytes in the brain. EVs play pivotal roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes such as waste removal, cell-to-cell communication and transport of either protective or pathogenic material into the extracellular space. Here we describe a detailed protocol for the reliable and consistent isolation of EVs from both murine and human brains, intended for anyone with basic laboratory experience and performed in a total time of 27 h. The method includes a mild extracellular matrix digestion of the brain tissue, a series of filtration and centrifugation steps to purify EVs and an iodixanol-based high-resolution density step gradient that fractionates different EV populations, including mitovesicles, a newly identified type of EV of mitochondrial origin. We also report detailed downstream protocols for the characterization and analysis of brain EV preparations using nanotrack analysis, electron microscopy and western blotting, as well as for measuring mitovesicular ATP kinetics. Furthermore, we compared this novel iodixanol-based high-resolution density step gradient to the previously described sucrose-based gradient. Although the yield of total EVs recovered was similar, the iodixanol-based gradient better separated distinct EV species as compared with the sucrose-based gradient, including subpopulations of microvesicles, exosomes and mitovesicles. This technique allows quantitative, highly reproducible analyses of brain EV subtypes under normal physiological processes and pathological brain conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become the focus of rising interest because of their numerous functions in physiology and pathology. Cells release heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins, including small EVs formed inside endosomal compartments (i.e., exosomes) and EVs of various sizes budding from the plasma membrane. Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9. Our work thus provides guidelines to define subtypes of EVs for future functional studies.
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been widely used for gene therapy. AAV-mediated gene transfer leads to durable protein expression in non-proliferating targeted tissues, which enables long-term modulation of gene expression. Here we describe a rAAV production protocol based on PEI-mediated triple transfection of HEK293T cells, followed by purification by iodixanol density gradient ultracentrifugation. Viral yield varies, depending on the size of the viral genome, but, typically, a yield of 3E11 viral genome (vg) can be achieved using the described protocol. Our results showed that injection of rAAV9 significantly transduces cardiac cells, which supports rAAV9 being an effective tool for gene delivery in the heart in vivo.
Iodixanol provides an easy and affordable solution to a problem that has limited resolution and brightness when imaging living samples.
