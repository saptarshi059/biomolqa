Zolpidem is currently the global market leader in the hypnotic arena. Recently several novel zolpidem formulations have been launched in the U.S. or are in the preregistration development phase. These comprise an extended-release form, two types of sublingual formulations and an oral spray. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of these formulations are reviewed.
STUDY OBJECTIVES: Nonrapid eye movement sleep boosts hippocampus-dependent, long-term memory formation more so than wake. Studies have pointed to several electrophysiological events that likely play a role in this process, including thalamocortical sleep spindles (12-15 Hz). However, interventional studies that directly probe the causal role of spindles in consolidation are scarce. Previous studies have used zolpidem, a GABA-A agonist, to increase sleep spindles during a daytime nap and promote hippocampal-dependent episodic memory. The current study investigated the effect of zolpidem on nighttime sleep and overnight improvement of episodic memories. METHODS: We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject design to test the a priori hypothesis that zolpidem would lead to increased memory performance on a word-paired associates task by boosting spindle activity. We also explored the impact of zolpidem across a range of other spectral sleep features, including slow oscillations (0-1 Hz), delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), sigma (12-15 Hz), as well as spindle-SO coupling. RESULTS: We showed greater memory improvement after a night of sleep with zolpidem, compared to placebo, replicating a prior nap study. Additionally, zolpidem increased sigma power, decreased theta and delta power, and altered the phase angle of spindle-SO coupling, compared to placebo. Spindle density, theta power, and spindle-SO coupling were associated with next-day memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sleep, specifically the timing and amount of sleep spindles, plays a causal role in the long-term formation of episodic memories. Furthermore, our results emphasize the role of nonrapid eye movement theta activity in human memory consolidation.
IMPORTANCE: Daytime functional impairments are the primary reasons for patients with insomnia to seek treatment, yet little is known about what the optimal treatment is for improving daytime functions and how best to proceed with treatment for patients whose insomnia has not remitted. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of behavioral therapy (BT) and zolpidem as initial therapies for improving daytime functions among patients with insomnia and evaluate the added value of a second treatment for patients whose insomnia has not remitted. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this sequential multiple-assignment randomized clinical trial conducted at institutions in Canada and the US, 211 adults with chronic insomnia disorder were enrolled between May 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015, and followed up for 12 months. Statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis in April and October 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to either BT or zolpidem as first-stage therapy, and those whose insomnia had not remitted received a second-stage psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy) or medication therapy (zolpidem or trazodone). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Study outcomes were daytime symptoms of insomnia, including mood disturbances, fatigue, functional impairments of insomnia, and scores on the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical and mental health components. RESULTS: Among 211 adults with insomnia (132 women [63%]; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years), 104 were allocated to BT and 107 to zolpidem at the first stage. First-stage treatment with BT or zolpidem yielded significant and equivalent benefits for most of the daytime outcomes, including depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II mean score change, -3.5 [95% CI, -4.7 to -2.3] vs -4.3 [95% CI, -5.7 to -2.9]), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory mean score change, -4.7 [95% CI, -7.3 to -2.2] vs -5.2 [95% CI, -7.9 to -2.5]), functional impairments (Work and Social Adjustment Scale mean score change, -5.0 [95% CI, -6.7 to -3.3] vs -5.1 [95% CI, -7.2 to -2.9]), and mental health (SF-36 mental health subscale mean score change, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.9-5.1] vs 2.5 [95% CI, 0.4-4.5]), while BT produced larger improvements for anxiety symptoms relative to zolpidem (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory mean score change, -4.1 [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.4] vs -1.2 [95% CI, -3.0 to 0.5]; P = .02; Cohen d = 0.55). Second-stage therapy produced additional improvements for the 2 conditions starting with zolpidem at posttreatment in fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, -3.8 [95% CI, -7.1 to -0.4]; zolpidem plus trazodone, -3.7 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.1]), functional impairments (Work and Social Adjustment Scale mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, -3.7 [95% CI, -6.4 to -1.0]; zolpidem plus trazodone, -3.3 [95% CI, -5.9 to -0.7]) and mental health (SF-36 mental health subscale mean score change: zolpidem plus BT, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.7-7.9]; zolpidem plus trazodone, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.1-4.0]). Treatment benefits achieved at posttreatment were well maintained throughout the 12-month follow-up, and additional improvements were noted for patients receiving the BT treatment sequences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of adults with insomnia disorder, BT and zolpidem produced improvements for various daytime symptoms of insomnia that were no different between treatments. Adding a second treatment offered an added value with further improvements of daytime functions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01651442.
INTRODUCTION: The imidazopyridine derivative zolpidem , which acts as a benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist, is the most widely prescribed hypnotic drug in the US. AREAS COVERED: This review addresses the neuroreceptor properties of zolpidem; clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug interactions; efficacy as a hypnotic; adverse effects; tolerance, dependence and withdrawal; relation to motor vehicle accidents and complex sleep behaviors; and new dosage forms. EXPERT OPINION: Approved doses of zolpidem (10 mg for adults, 5 mg for the elderly) are consistently effective in reducing sleep latency and consequently increasing sleep duration in patients with insomnia. However, favorable effects on sleep maintenance are observed less consistently. Residual daytime effects are unlikely with recommended doses, and provided that at least 8 h elapse prior to arising. Hypnotic efficacy is maintained with repeated nightly use, and the risk of rebound insomnia is low. Dependence and abuse of zolpidem are no more likely to occur than with typical benzodiazepines. Newly available novel dosage forms of zolpidem have increased therapeutic options for patients with insomnia variants such as sleep maintenance insomnia and middle-of-the-night awakening.
Zolpidem (Ambien) is an imidazopyridine hypnotic recently introduced in the USA. We report a case of a fatal overdose of Ambien. A 68-year-old female ingested at least 30 tablets of 10 mg Ambien (300 mg). She was found dead at home. Toxicological analyses revealed blood concentration of 4.1, 19.3 and 2.3 micrograms/ml of zolpidem, meprobamate and carisoprodol, respectively.
