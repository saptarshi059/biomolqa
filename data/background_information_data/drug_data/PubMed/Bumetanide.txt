Loop diuretics, including torsemide, furosemide, bumetanide, and piretanide, act by inhibiting the sodium-potassium-chloride (Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-)) cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle within the nephron. This mechanism is pivotal in managing fluid retention associated with conditions such as heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. A comprehensive understanding of how these diuretics uniquely target this transporter provides crucial insights into effectively addressing fluid overload across diverse clinical conditions.
A recent Phase II randomized, controlled trial of bumetanide as an adjunctive treatment for neonatal seizures showed a robust efficacy signal and no evidence of toxicity. Concerns regarding bumetanide as an adjunctive anticonvulsant are addressed here. An adequately powered multi-institutional trial is needed to accurately determine efficacy.
Bumetanide and furosemide are potent loop diuretics; the former is 40 to 50 times more potent than the latter on a weight basis. Bumetanide is absorbed more quickly than furosemide and is twice as bioavailable. Both drugs exhibit changes in elimination in the presence of renal insufficiency as well as changes in the time course of absorption in congestive heart failure. More data are needed to assess potential differences between them in various clinical conditions.
Currently information is available for 20 potential anti-seizure drugs in clinical development. They include candidates with mechanisms of action similar to those of marketed AEDs (allopregnanolone, brivaracetam, ganaxolone, ICA-105665, NS1209, selurampanel); those with new mechanisms of action (beprodon, VX-765); compounds repurposed for the treatment of epilepsy (biperiden, bumetanide, fenfluramine, melatonin, nalutozan, pitolisant, quinidine, valnoctamide, verapamil); and finally candidates with currently unknown mechanisms of action (JNJ-26489112, UCB0942, YKP3089 (Cenobamate). Clinical development of anti-seizure drugs is still active but unexciting. Potential anti-seizure drugs continue to be largely identified by their activity against seizures provoked by electrical or chemical procedures in animals with normal brains. As in the past, this may lead to new drugs whose efficacy is not better than that of those already on the market.
We recently showed that constraining eye contact leads to exaggerated increase of amygdala activation in autism. Here, in a proof of concept pilot study, we demonstrate that administration of bumetanide (a NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist that restores GABAergic inhibition) normalizes the level of amygdala activation during constrained eye contact with dynamic emotional face stimuli in autism. In addition, eye-tracking data reveal that bumetanide administration increases the time spent in spontaneous eye gaze during in a free-viewing mode of the same face stimuli. In keeping with clinical trials, our data support the Excitatory/Inhibitory dysfunction hypothesis in autism, and indicate that bumetanide may improve specific aspects of social processing in autism. Future double-blind placebo controlled studies with larger cohorts of participants will help clarify the mechanisms of bumetanide action in autism.
