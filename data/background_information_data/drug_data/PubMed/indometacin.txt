This article reviews the disorders of thunderclap, cough, exertional and sexual headache. These are a group of paroxysmal and precipitated headaches, which often occur in bouts with prolonged remissions. Indometacin seems to be the most effective preventative. Each can occur in primary and secondary form. Thunderclap headache is the most frequently reported headache syndrome associated with a secondary pathology. Discussed are the complexities of whether all patients with thunderclap headache should have further investigation if timely computerised tomography is normal and, the relevance of abnormal imaging in these disorders, differentiating what is deemed to be secondary and managing the pain.
Paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua are indometacin-sensitive trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, a terminology which reflects the predominant distribution of the pain, observable cranial autonomic features and shared pathophysiology. Understanding the latter is limited, both by low prevalence and the intricacies of studying brain function, requiring multimodal techniques to glean insights into such disorders. Similarly obscure is the curious response to indometacin. This review will address what is currently known about pathophysiology, the rationale for the current classification and, features which may confound the diagnosis, such as lack of cranial autonomic symptoms and those which are typically associated with migraine such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia and aura. Despite these characteristics, a dramatic response to indometacin, which is not seen in migraine nor the other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias , provides the hallmark of the diagnosis. The main clinical differential for paroxysmal hemicrania is based on temporal pattern and lies between cluster headache and short-lasting-neuralgiform headache attacks with tearing or additional cranial autonomic symptoms. For hemicrania continua it is more challenging as the main differential for which the disorder is often treated is migraine. A prior episodic pattern, often days at a time, and the tendency to exacerbation with analgesics will further deflect from the diagnosis. The relevance of this is that there is little overlap in therapeutics between paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua and other headache disorders and there are limited effective alternatives to indometacin. The most effective are other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including the newer COX-II inhibitors. Even though early reports suggest that a higher indometacin dose-requirement may herald a secondary precipitating pathology, this does not seem to be the case, with syndrome and response to treatment being similar with the primary disorder. In this context imaging of new onset paroxysmal hemicrania or hemicrania continua and implication of the results will be discussed as will alternative treatment options.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Little is known about most disorders classified as rare primary headaches. This review summarizes current knowledge about clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology and treatment options of rare headache disorders. Increasing public awareness on the different types of rare primary headache disorders may lead to more research and better patient identification and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The International Headache Society updated the classification criteria for primary headache disorders adding some clinical entities and moving others to different parts of the classification. SUMMARY: Neuroimaging should be performed in all patients suspected to suffer from rare primary headache to rule out secondary causes of headache. Indometacin might have a good therapeutic effect in some of these headache entities, but larger randomized controlled trials are missing.
INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth occurs in about 5% to 10% of all births in resource-rich countries, but in recent years the incidence seems to have increased in some countries, particularly in the USA. We found little reliable evidence for incidence in resource-poor countries. The rate in northwestern Ethiopia has been reported to vary from 11% to 22%, depending on the age group of mothers studied, and is highest in teenage mothers. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of preventive interventions in women at high risk of preterm delivery? What are the effects of interventions to improve neonatal outcome after preterm rupture of membranes? What are the effects of treatments to stop contractions in preterm labour? What are the effects of elective compared with selective caesarean delivery for women in preterm labour? What are the effects of interventions to improve neonatal outcome in preterm delivery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amnioinfusion for preterm rupture of membranes, antenatal corticosteroids, antibiotic treatment, bed rest, beta-mimetics, calcium channel blockers, elective caesarean, enhanced antenatal care programmes, magnesium sulphate, oxytocin receptor antagonists (atosiban), progesterone, prophylactic cervical cerclage, prostaglandin inhibitors (e.g., indometacin), selective caesarean, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (plus corticosteroids).
BACKGROUND: The risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications associated with the use of NSAIDs is a serious public health concern. The risk varies between individual NSAIDs; however, there is little information on the risk associated with some NSAIDs and on the impact of risk factors. These data are necessary to evaluate the benefit-risk of individual NSAIDs for clinical and health policy decision making. Within the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, the Safety Of non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [SOS] project aims to develop decision models for regulatory and clinical use of individual NSAIDs according to their GI and cardiovascular safety. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to provide summary relative risks (RR) of upper GI complications (UGIC) associated with the use of individual NSAIDs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. METHODS: We used the MEDLINE database to identify cohort and case-control studies published between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 2011, providing adjusted effect estimates for UGIC comparing individual NSAIDs with non-use of NSAIDs. We estimated pooled RR and 95% CIs of UGIC for individual NSAIDs overall and by dose using fixed- and random-effects methods. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate methodological and clinical heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: A total of 2984 articles were identified and 59 were selected for data abstraction. After review of the abstracted information, 28 studies met the meta-analysis inclusion criteria. Pooled RR ranged from 1.43 (95% CI 0.65, 3.15) for aceclofenac to 18.45 (95% CI 10.99, 30.97) for azapropazone. RR was less than 2 for aceclofenac, celecoxib (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.17, 1.81) and ibuprofen (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.54, 2.20); 2 to less than 4 for rofecoxib (RR 2.32; 95% CI 1.89, 2.86), sulindac (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.90, 4.42), diclofenac (RR 3.34; 95% CI 2.79, 3.99), meloxicam (RR 3.47; 95% CI 2.19, 5.50), nimesulide (RR 3.83; 95% CI 3.20, 4.60) and ketoprofen (RR 3.92; 95% CI 2.70, 5.69); 4-5 for tenoxicam (RR 4.10; 95% CI 2.16, 7.79), naproxen (RR 4.10; 95% CI 3.22, 5.23), indometacin (RR 4.14; 95% CI 2.91, 5.90) and diflunisal (RR 4.37; 95% CI 1.07, 17.81); and greater than 5 for piroxicam (RR 7.43; 95% CI 5.19, 10.63), ketorolac (RR 11.50; 95% CI 5.56, 23.78) and azapropazone. RRs for the use of high daily doses of NSAIDs versus non-use were 2-3 times higher than those associated with low daily doses. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed variability in the risk of UGIC among individual NSAIDs as used in clinical practice. Factors influencing findings across studies (e.g. definition and validation of UGIC, exposure assessment, analysis of new vs prevalent users) and the scarce data on the effect of dose and duration of use of NSAIDs and on concurrent use of other medications need to be addressed in future studies, including SOS.
