BACKGROUND: Tenofovir alafenamide shows high antiviral efficacy and improved renal and bone safety compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when used for HIV treatment. Here, we report primary results from a blinded phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide versus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention. METHODS: This study is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done at 94 community, public health, and hospital-associated clinics located in regions of Europe and North America, where there is a high incidence of HIV or prevalence of people living with HIV, or both. We enrolled adult cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men, both with a high risk of acquiring HIV on the basis of their self-reported sexual behaviour in the past 12 weeks or their recent history (within 24 weeks of enrolment) of bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Participants with current or previous use of PrEP with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were not excluded. We used a computer-generated random allocation sequence to randomly assign (1:1) participants to receive either emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group), or emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). As such, all participants were given two tablets. The trial sponsor, investigators, participants, and the study staff who provided the study drugs, assessed the outcomes, and collected the data were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy outcome was incident HIV infection, which was assessed when all participants had completed 48 weeks of follow-up and half of all participants had completed 96 weeks of follow-up. This full analysis set included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned study drug and had at least one post-baseline HIV test. Non-inferiority of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was established if the upper bound of the 95.003% CI of the HIV incidence rate ratio (IRR) was less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.62. We prespecified six secondary bone mineral density and renal biomarker safety endpoints to evaluate using the safety analysis set. This analysis set included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of the assigned study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02842086, and is no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2016, and June 30, 2017, 5387 (92%) of 5857 participants were randomly assigned and received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (n=2694) or emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=2693). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis (ie, when all participants had completed 48 weeks and 50% had completed 96 weeks) emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention, as the upper limit of the 95% CI of the IRR, was less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.62 (IRR 0.47 [95% CI 0.19-1.15]). After 8756 person-years of follow-up, 22 participants were diagnosed with HIV, seven participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group (0.16 infections per 100 person-years [95% CI 0.06-0.33]), and 15 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (0.34 infections per 100 person-years [0.19-0.56]). Both regimens were well tolerated, with a low number of participants reporting adverse events that led to discontinuation of the study drug (36 [1%] of 2694 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group vs 49 [2%] of 2693 participants in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide was superior to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all six prespecified bone mineral density and renal biomarker safety endpoints. INTERPRETATION: Daily emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide shows non-inferior efficacy to daily emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention, and the number of adverse events for both regimens was low. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide had more favourable effects on bone mineral density and biomarkers of renal safety than emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

BACKGROUND: Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine is the only approved complete long-acting regimen for the maintenance of HIV-1 virological suppression dosed every 2 months. The SOLAR study aimed to compare long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine every 2 months with continued once-daily bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide for the maintenance of HIV-1 virological suppression in adults living with HIV. METHODS: SOLAR is a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3b, non-inferiority study. The study was done in 118 centres across 14 countries. Participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL were randomly assigned (2:1), stratified by sex at birth and BMI, to either long-acting cabotegravir (600 mg) plus rilpivirine (900 mg) dosed intramuscularly every 2 months or to continue daily oral bictegravir (50 mg), emtricitabine (200 mg), and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg). Participants randomly assigned to long-acting therapy had a choice to receive cabotegravir (30 mg) plus rilpivirine (25 mg) once daily as an optional oral lead-in for approximately 1 month. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with virological non-response (HIV-1 RNA >/=50 copies per mL; the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm, 4% non-inferiority margin; modified intention-to-treat exposed population) at month 11 (long-acting start with injections group) and month 12 (long-acting with oral lead-in group and bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04542070, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: 837 participants were screened between Nov 9, 2020, and May 31, 2021, and 687 were randomly assigned to switch treatment or continue existing treatment. Of 670 participants (modified intention-to-treat exposed population), 447 (67%) switched to long-acting therapy (274 [61%] of 447 start with injections; 173 [39%] of 447 with oral lead-in) and 223 (33%) continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Baseline characteristics were similar; median age was 37 years (range 18-74), 118 (18%) of 670 were female sex at birth, 207 (31%) of 670 were non-White, and median BMI was 25.9 kg/m(2) (IQR 23.3-29.5). At month 11-12, long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine showed non-inferior efficacy versus bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (HIV-1 RNA >/=50 copies per mL, five [1%] of 447 vs one [<1%] of 223), with an adjusted treatment difference of 0.7 (95% CI -0.7 to 2.0). Excluding injection site reactions, adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between groups. No treatment-related deaths occurred. More long-acting group participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal (25 [6%] of 454 vs two [1%] of 227). Injection site reactions were reported by 316 (70%) of 454 long-acting participants; most (98%) were grade 1 or 2. INTERPRETATION: These data support the use of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine dosed every 2 months as a complete antiretroviral regimen that has similar efficacy to a commonly used integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based first-line regimen, while addressing unmet psychosocial issues associated with daily oral treatment.

Background: forgiveness is the ability of a given regimen to maintain complete viral suppression despite a documented imperfect adherence. We explored forgiveness of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Methods: drug refills were used to calculate the percent day covered (PDC) as a proxy of adherence. Forgiveness was calculated as the achieved rate of a selected HIV-RNA threshold by a given level of imperfect adherence. Results: 281 adult PLWH were followed for 343 patient/years. Adherence was very high with a median of 98% (IQR 95-100%). A PDC as low as 70% was sufficient to obtain 100% and maintain virologic suppression. According to probit analysis adherence was not related to the possibility to maintain an HIV-RNA TND or < 50 copies/ml. Conclusions: Long-term success of ART needs effective regimens that are the least intrusive of the patient's lifestyle, an elevated forgiveness may be considered as an additional feature that can further improve long-term outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended components of initial antiretroviral therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Bictegravir is a novel, potent INSTI with a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and low potential as a perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bictegravir coformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination versus coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. METHODS: We did this double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at 122 outpatient centres in nine countries in Europe, Latin America, and North America. We enrolled HIV-1 infected adults (aged >/=18 years) who were previously untreated (HIV-1 RNA >/=500 copies per mL); HLA-B*5701-negative; had no hepatitis B virus infection; screening genotypes showing sensitivity to emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, and abacavir; and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min or more. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size of four), to receive coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or coformulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg, with matching placebo, once daily for 144 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 RNA (</=100 000 copies per mL, >100 000 to </=400 000 copies per mL, or >400 000 copies per mL), CD4 count (<50 cells per muL, 50-199 cells per muL, or >/=200 cells per muL), and region (USA or ex-USA). Investigators, participants, and study staff giving treatment, assessing outcomes, and collecting data were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -12%. All participants who received one dose of study drug were included in primary efficacy and safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02607930. FINDINGS: Between Nov 13, 2015, and July 14, 2016, we randomly assigned 631 participants to receive coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (n=316) or coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (n=315), of whom 314 and 315 patients, respectively, received at least one dose of study drug. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL was achieved in 92.4% of patients (n=290 of 314) in the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group and 93.0% of patients (n=293 of 315) in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (difference -0.6%, 95.002% CI -4.8 to 3.6; p=0.78), demonstrating non-inferiority of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide to dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. No individual developed treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug. Incidence and severity of adverse events was mostly similar between groups except for nausea, which occurred less frequently in patients given bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide than in those given dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (10% [n=32] vs 23% [n=72]; p<0.0001). Adverse events related to study drug were less common with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide than with dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (26% [n=82] vs 40% [n=127]), the difference being driven by a higher incidence of drug-related nausea in the dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine group (5% [n=17] vs 17% [n=55]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: At 48 weeks, coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide achieved virological suppression in 92% of previously untreated adults and was non-inferior to coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine, with no treatment-emergent resistance. Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was safe and well tolerated with better gastrointestinal tolerability than dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. Because coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide does not require HLA B*5701 testing and provides guideline-recommended treatment for individuals co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B, this regimen might lend itself to rapid or same-day initiation of therapy in the clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: ADVANCE compared the efficacy and safety of two antiretroviral first-line combinations (dolutegravir combined with emtricitabine and either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide), with a third regimen (efavirenz combined with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) previously recommended by WHO. Here, we report the 96-week data for the study. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial, was done at two research sites in Johannesburg, South Africa, after participant recruitment from 11 public health clinics also in Johannesburg. Eligible participants were aged 12 years or older with HIV-1 infection, who weighed at least 40 kg, had no antiretroviral exposure in the previous 6 months, with a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL/min (>80 mL per min in individuals aged <19 years), and a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of 500 copies per mL or higher. Individuals who were pregnant or had tuberculosis were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by study staff using a computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by age (12 and <19 years and >/=19 years). Participants were randomly assigned to once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; once-daily oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg, and once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg; or once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and efavirenz 600 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, which has been reported previously. Here, we report the key secondary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of participants who had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL at the week 96 visit, assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -10%. Safety data, including clinical, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and laboratory data, are also reported. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03122262. FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2017, and May 14, 2018, we screened 1453 individuals, of whom 1053 were enrolled: 351 participants were randomly assigned to the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 351 to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group. All participants received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the primary analysis. At week 96, 276 (79%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, 275 (78%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 258 (74%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group had achieved a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 50 copies per mL. Non-inferiority was established in all three comparisons. The proportion of patients with protocol-defined virological failure at week 96 was low in all treatment groups. Participants in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group had fewer changes in bone density than the two other treatment groups. Mean weight gain was substantial (7.1 kg [SD 7.4] in the tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group; 4.3 kg [6.7] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir group, and 2.3 kg [7.0] in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group), and was greater among women than men. Ten (3%) of 351 participants in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, and efavirenz group discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events, of which liver dysfunction (n=4) and rash (n=4) were most common. INTERPRETATION: Medium-term and long-term metabolic and clinical consequences of the considerable increase in bodyweight observed in participants given these antiretroviral regimens and the trajectory of this weight gain over time, especially among women, require further study.

BACKGROUND: In DISCOVER, a multinational, randomised controlled trial, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide compared with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate showed non-inferior efficacy for HIV prevention and improved bone mineral density and renal safety biomarkers at week 48. We report outcomes analysed after all participants had completed 96 weeks of follow-up. METHODS: This study is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done at 94 community, public health, and hospital-associated clinics located in Europe and North America. Adult cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men, both with a high risk of acquiring HIV as determined by self-reported sexual behaviour or recent sexually transmitted infections, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (200/25 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group), or emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (200/300 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group). The primary efficacy outcome was incident HIV infection. Incidence of HIV-1 infection per 100 person-years was assessed when the last participant had completed 96 weeks of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02842086. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2016, and June 30, 2017, 5387 participants were randomly assigned to receive emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (n=2694) or emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=2693), contributing 10 081 person-years of follow-up. At 96 weeks of follow-up, there were eight HIV infections in participants who had received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (0.16 infections per 100 person-years [95% CI 0.07-0.31]) and 15 in participants who had received emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (0.30 infections per 100 person-years [0.17-0.49]). Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide maintained its non-inferiority to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention (IRR 0.54 [95% CI 0.23-1.26]). Approximately 78-82% of participants reported taking study medication more than 95% of the time across all study visits. Rates of sexually transmitted infections remained high and similar across groups (21 cases per 100 person-years for rectal gonorrhoea and 28 cases per 100 person-years for rectal chlamydia). Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide continued to show superiority over emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all but one of the six prespecified bone mineral density and renal biomarkers. There was more weight gain among participants who had received emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (median weight gain 1.7 kg vs 0.5 kg, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide is safe and effective for longer-term pre-exposure prophylaxis in cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is important for both maternal health and prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens that are likely to be used by pregnant women are scarce. In this trial we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the USA, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged >/=18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14-28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals in the past were excluded (up to 14 days of ART during the current pregnancy was permitted), as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses, or those with known fetal anomaly or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was done using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14-18, 19-23, and 24-28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate 25 mg; once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg; or once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants with viral suppression, defined as an HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 200 copies per mL, at or within 14 days of delivery, assessed in all participants with an HIV-1 RNA result available from the delivery visit, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -10% in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups versus the efavirenz-containing group (superiority was tested in a pre-planned secondary analysis). Primary safety outcomes, compared pairwise among treatment groups, were the occurrence of a composite adverse pregnancy outcome (ie, either preterm delivery, the infant being born small for gestational age, stillbirth, or spontaneous abortion) in all participants with a pregnancy outcome, and the occurrence of grade 3 or higher maternal and infant adverse events in all randomised participants. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03048422. FINDINGS: Between Jan 19, 2018, and Feb 8, 2019, we enrolled and randomly assigned 643 pregnant women: 217 to the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group, 215 to the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, and 211 to the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group. At enrolment, median gestational age was 21.9 weeks (IQR 18.3-25.3), the median HIV-1 RNA concentration among participants was 902.5 copies per mL (152.0-5182.5; 181 [28%] of 643 participants had HIV-1 RNA concentrations of <200 copies per mL), and the median CD4 count was 466 cells per muL (308-624). HIV-1 RNA concentrations at delivery were available for 605 (94%) participants. Of these, 395 (98%) of 405 participants in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups had viral suppression at delivery compared with 182 (91%) of 200 participants in the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (estimated difference 6.5% [95% CI 2.0 to 10.7], p=0.0052; excluding the non-inferiority margin of -10%). Significantly fewer participants in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group (52 [24%] of 216) had a composite adverse pregnancy outcome than those in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (70 [33%] of 213; estimated difference -8.8% [95% CI -17.3 to -0.3], p=0.043) or the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (69 [33%] of 211; -8.6% [-17.1 to -0.1], p=0.047). The proportion of participants or infants with grade 3 or higher adverse events did not differ among the three groups. The proportion of participants who had a preterm delivery was significantly lower in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group (12 [6%] of 208) than in the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (25 [12%] of 207; -6.3% [-11.8 to -0.9], p=0.023). Neonatal mortality was significantly higher in the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (ten [5%] of 207 infants) than in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group (two [1%] of 208; p=0.019) or the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (three [2%] of 202; p=0.050). INTERPRETATION: When started in pregnancy, dolutegravir-containing regimens had superior virological efficacy at delivery compared with the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen. The dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate regimen had the lowest frequency of composite adverse pregnancy outcomes and of neonatal deaths.

BACKGROUND: Effective two-drug regimens could decrease long-term drug exposure and toxicity with HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART). We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen compared with a three-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-naive adults. METHODS: We conducted two identically designed, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials: GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. Both studies were done at 192 centres in 21 countries. We included participants (>/=18 years) with HIV-1 infection and a screening HIV-1 RNA of 500 000 copies per mL or less, and who were naive to ART. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive a once-daily two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) or a once-daily three-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg). Both drug regimens were administered orally. We masked participants and investigators to treatment assignment: dolutegravir was administered as single-entity tablets (similar to its commercial formulation, except with a different film colour), and lamivudine tablets and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine tablets were over-encapsulated to visually match each other. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in the intention-to-treat-exposed population, using the Snapshot algorithm and a non-inferiority margin of -10%. Safety analyses were done on the safety population. GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02831673 and NCT02831764, respectively. FINDINGS: Between July 18, 2016, and March 31, 2017, 1441 participants across both studies were randomly assigned to receive either the two-drug regimen (n=719) or three-drug regimen (n=722). At week 48 in the GEMINI-1 intention-to-treat-exposed population, 320 (90%) of 356 participants receiving the two-drug regimen and 332 (93%) of 358 receiving the three-drug regimen achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted treatment difference -2.6%, 95% CI -6.7 to 1.5); in GEMINI-2, 335 (93%) of 360 in the two-drug regimen and 337 (94%) of 359 in the three-drug regimen achieved HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL (adjusted treatment difference -0.7%, 95% CI -4.3 to 2.9), showing non-inferiority at a -10% margin in both studies (pooled analysis: 655 [91%] of 716 in the two-drug regimen vs 669 [93%] of 717 in the three-drug regimen; adjusted treatment difference -1.7%, 95% CI -4.4 to 1.1). Numerically, more drug-related adverse events occurred with the three-drug regimen than with the two-drug regimen (169 [24%] of 717 vs 126 [18%] of 716); few participants discontinued because of adverse events (16 [2%] in the three-drug regimen and 15 [2%] in the two-drug regimen). Two deaths were reported in the two-drug regimen group of GEMINI-2, but neither was considered to be related to the study medication. INTERPRETATION: The non-inferior efficacy and similar tolerability profile of dolutegravir plus lamivudine to a guideline-recommended three-drug regimen at 48 weeks in ART-naive adults supports its use as initial therapy for patients with HIV-1 infection.

Doravirine (DOR) concentrations and HIV-1 RNA were evaluated in genital fluids from adults with HIV on stable therapy who switched to DOR + FTC/TAF. High protein-unbound DOR concentrations were observed in both seminal plasma and cervicovaginal fluid. DOR + FTC/TAF maintained viral suppression in genital fluids in all but 1 participant.
BACKGROUND: Injectable cabotegravir was superior to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine for HIV prevention in two clinical trials. Both trials had the primary aim of establishing the HIV prevention efficacy of long-acting injectable cabotegravir pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine daily oral PrEP. Long-acting PrEP was associated with diagnostic delays and integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance. This report presents findings from the first unblinded year of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 study. METHODS: The HPTN 083 randomised controlled trial enrolled HIV-uninfected cisgender men and transgender women at elevated HIV risk who have sex with men, from 43 clinical research sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the USA. Inclusion criteria included: a negative HIV serological test at the screening and study entry, undetectable HIV RNA levels within 14 days of study entry, age 18 years or older, overall good health as determined by clinical and laboratory evaluations, and a creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min or higher. Participants were randomly allocated to receive long-acting injectable cabotegravir or daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP. After study unblinding, participants remained on their original regimen awaiting an extension study. HIV infections were characterised retrospectively at a central laboratory. Here we report the secondary analysis of efficacy and safety for the first unblinded year. The primary outcome was incident HIV infection. Efficacy analyses were done on the modified intention-to-treat population using a Cox regression model. Adverse events were compared across treatment groups and time periods (blinded vs unblinded). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02720094. FINDINGS: Of the 4488 participants who contributed person-time to the blinded analysis, 3290 contributed person-time to the first unblinded year analysis between May 15, 2020, and May 14, 2021. Updated HIV incidence in the blinded phase was 0.41 per 100 person-years for long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP and 1.29 per 100 person-years for daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31 [95% CI 0.17-0.58], p=0.0003). HIV incidence in the first unblinded year was 0.82 per 100 person-years for long-acting PrEP and 2.27 per 100 person-years for daily oral PrEP (HR 0.35 [0.18-0.69], p=0.002). Adherence to both study products decreased after study unblinding. Additional infections in the long-acting PrEP group included two with on-time injections; three with one or more delayed injections; two detected with long-acting PrEP reinitiation; and 11 more than 6 months after their last injection. Infection within 6 months of cabotegravir exposure was associated with diagnostic delays and INSTI resistance. Adverse events were generally consistent with previous reports; incident hypertension in the long-acting PrEP group requires further investigation. INTERPRETATION: Long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP retained high efficacy for HIV prevention in men and transgender women who have sex with men during the first year of open-label follow-up, with a near-identical HR for HIV risk reduction between long-acting injectable cabotegravir and daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine PrEP during the first year after unblinding compared with the blinded period. Extended follow-up further defined the risk period for diagnostic delays and emergence of INSTI resistance.

Data supporting the safe and effective use of first-line antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis remains limited. Previously in this journal, the first case report of BIC/FTC/TAF use in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was presented. We present the first known case of DOR + FTC/TAF in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
BACKGROUND: This real-world study compared the safety and effectiveness of Dolutegravir/lamivudine (D/L) and Bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenefovir alafenamide (B/F/T) switch therapy regimens for people living with HIV (PLWH). METHODS: The retrospective study conducted from April 2019 to November 2022, included PLWH with < 50 copies/mL of HIV-RNA prior to recruitment who initiated either D/L or B/F/T switching therapy. The primary objective was to evaluate treatment discontinuation rates; safety and virologic outcomes were also evaluated. RESULTS: 690 PLWH were included, 358 in the D/L and 332 in the B/F/T, and a median follow-up of 728 and 1013 days, respectively. The discontinuation proportions were 8.7% (31 participants, incidence rate of 4.44 per 100 PYFU in the D/L group and 15.3% (51 participants, incidence rate of 6.25 per 100 PYFU) in the B/F/T group. The adjusted hazard ratio for B/F/T discontinuation compared to D/L was 1.20 (95% CI: 0.71;2.0; p = 0.494). Virologic failure (VL > 200 copies/mL in two consecutive measurements) occurred in 1.1% and 0.9% of patients in the D/L and B/F/T groups, respectively. Notably, one patient in D/L group with severe non-adherence and virologic failure developed resistance mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to either B/T/F or D/L treatment for PLWH was effective and well tolerated in this real-world study. Treatment discontinuation rates did not significantly differ between the two regimens.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, informed communities have demanded and fought for access to life-saving treatment. The last several years have seen interesting developments in this area - particularly with respect to the switch to dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens and scale-up of routine viral load testing (RVLT), and how these directly and indirectly impact issues of treatment optimization, HIV drug resistance, and sexual and reproductive health. In this review, we present recent advances in antiretroviral treatment and monitoring in the context of how treatment education and community demand for them. RECENT FINDINGS: The latest developments with DTG and RVLT highlight underlying issues for global health systems that need to be addressed - including drug surveillance, supply chain management, and comprehensive care linkages - and the importance of community engagement in such issues. SUMMARY: Decisions about treatment must be grounded in informed community demand, and should exist in the context of optimal care and treatment across the entire HIV cascade. Informed advocacy is essential for people living with HIV and their communities, so that they benefit from existing and future therapeutic advances. Research is needed on the importance of community demand across the HIV treatment cascade.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 96 weeks of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) treatment in participants switching from dolutegravir (DTG)-based therapy. DESIGN: Studies 1489 (NCT02607930) and 1490 (NCT02607956) were phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, first-line therapy trials in people with HIV-1. After 144 weeks of DTG-based or B/F/TAF treatment, participants could enter a 96-week open-label extension (OLE) of B/F/TAF. METHODS: A pooled analysis evaluated viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml) and changes in CD4 + cell count at OLE Weeks 48 and 96, treatment-emergent resistance, safety, and tolerability after switch from a DTG-based regimen to B/F/TAF. Outcomes by prior treatment were summarized using descriptive statistics and compared by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: At OLE Week 96, participants who switched to B/F/TAF ( N  = 519) maintained high levels of virologic suppression (99.5 and 99.1% in those switching from DTG/abacavir/lamivudine and DTG+F/TAF, respectively) and CD4 + cell count, with no treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF. Twenty-one participants experienced drug-related adverse events after switching, with diarrhea, weight gain, and headache occurring most commonly. There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy, drug-related Grade 4 adverse events, or serious adverse events. Two participants discontinued B/F/TAF due to treatment-related adverse events. Participants who switched from DTG/abacavir/lamivudine experienced statistically significant greater weight gain than those who switched from DTG+F/TAF; however, median weight change from the blinded phase baseline to OLE Week 96 was numerically similar across treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This medium-term analysis demonstrates the safety and efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF from a DTG-containing regimen in people with HIV-1.
BACKGROUND: The ability of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) to maintain virologic suppression in participants with M184V and/or M184I resistance mutations from historical genotypic reports when switching from a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based or abacavir (ABC)-based regimen was investigated. SETTING: Phase IIIb, 48-week, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, clinical trial (NCT02616029). METHODS: Virologically suppressed adults with HIV and documented M184V/I on historical genotypic records switched to E/C/F/TAF from a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based or ABC-based regimen. The primary end point was HIV-1 RNA of <50 copies per milliliter at week 12 using pure virologic response (PVR). Secondary end points included HIV-1 RNA of <50 copies per milliliter at weeks 24/48 (PVR) and at weeks 12, 24, and 48 (Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm), and change in CD4+ count at weeks 12, 24, and 48. RESULTS: M184V alone was reported in 82.8% of 64 participants; 9.4% and 7.8% had M184I and M184V/I, respectively, and 43.8% had archived M184V/I (baseline DNA). All (62/62 with available data, 100%, 95% confidence interval 94.2% to 100%) participants maintained PVR at weeks 12, 24, and 48. By Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm, one participant had HIV-1 RNA of >/=50 copies per milliliter (week 12); confirmatory HIV-1 RNA was <50 copies per milliliter. No significant changes were observed in CD4+ cell count. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported by 10 (15.6%) participants. Six (9.4%) and 5 (7.8%) participants had grade 3-4 AEs or serious AEs, respectively (none drug related). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the resistance mutations M184V/I did not jeopardize the efficacy of switching to E/C/F/TAF in virologically suppressed adults. High rates of virologic suppression were maintained throughout 48 weeks of therapy and treatment was well tolerated.
AIM: Treatment and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in pregnancy utilizes tenofovir (TFV) and emtricitabine (FTC) as NRTI backbone in combination with a third agent from a different class. We hypothesized that combined effect of pregnancy and pharmacogenetics significantly changes TFV and FTC pharmacokinetics (PK). Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the role of SNPs of transporters (ABCC2 and ABCC4) on TFV and FTC PK during pregnancy. METHOD: 61 pregnant or postpartum women on TFV and FTC were selected from a group of pregnant and postpartum Nigerian women and both SNPs and drug levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Pregnancy decreases TFV plasma concentration by 26% (log(10) beta = -0.131 [-0.228, -0.034; p = 0.009] at median [range] time-point postdose 14 [7-18.5h]). FTC concentration in individuals with ABCC2 12:g.154962860T>C TT genotype were one- to twofold higher than heterozygous (CT) and homozygous (CC) women. All other evaluated SNPs were not significant. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy decreased TFV concentration and significant relationship was found between FTC and ABCC2 12:g.154962860T>C wild-type allele. However, the interplay between pregnancy and pharmacogenetics on TFV and FTC PK is unclear but require further evaluation.
OBJECTIVES: Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) is a recommended and widely used regimen for HIV infection. In this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of E/C/F/TAF in people living with HIV (PLWH), who are either treatment-naive or switched from any tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimen. For switched patients, we aimed to determine the impact of switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to TAF on lipid profile and kidney functions. METHODS: ACTHIV-IST Study Group produced a database, and five dedicated HIV centres in Istanbul entered data of PLWH who switched from any TDF-containing regimen to E/C/F/TAF and treatment-naive patients who were initiated with the E/C/F/TAF regimen between January 2017 and December 2019. Clinical findings, viral parameters, lipid studies, renal function tests, adverse events and adherence to the treatment were recorded in this prospective observational study. RESULTS: The study included a total of 614 switched and treatment-naive patients. Of 430 treatment-experienced patients, 89% (382) were men, and the mean age was 42 +/- 12 years. Among them, 47% (181/382) self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). The median duration of HIV diagnosis was 54 +/- 29 months. The median duration of E/C/F/TAF use was 20 +/- 36 months and that of previous treatment was 23 +/- 18 months. HIV-RNA was undetectable at baseline and month 12 in 84.1% (360/428) and 86.1% (328/381) of patients, respectively (p > 0.05). Mean CD4 counts were 708 +/- 287 cells/microL and 802 +/- 305 cells/microL at baseline and month 12, respectively (p < 0.001). Serum creatinine levels remained stable during the treatment period. Mean total cholesterol levels at baseline and month 12 were 172 and 211 mg/dL (p < 0.01), LDL-cholesterol 104 and 138 mg/dL (p < 0.01), HDL-cholesterol 39 and 49 mg/dL (p < 0.01) and triglycerides 134 and 174 mg/dL (p < 0.01), respectively. The treatment was generally well tolerated. Eight patients discontinued the therapy (drug interaction: 3; lost to follow-up: 1; pregnancy: 1; pulmonary tuberculosis: 1; side effect: 1; patient's decision: 1). Of 184 treatment-naive patients, 88% (162) were men, and the mean age was 36.5+/- 12 years. Among them, 50% (81/162) self-identified as MSM. The mean duration of HIV infection was 21.6 +/- 17.1 months. The mean duration of E/C/F/TAF use was 16 +/- 4 months. HIV-RNA was undetectable at baseline and month 12 in 1% and 89.1% of patients, respectively. Mean CD4 counts at baseline and month 12 were 469 +/- 223 cells/microL and 740 +/- 298 cells/microL, respectively. During the treatment period, creatinine levels remained stable. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and also HDL-cholesterol levels increased. Mean total cholesterol levels at baseline and month 12 were 167 and 211 mg/dL (p < 0.01), LDL-cholesterol 108 and 143 mg/dL (p < 0.01), HDL-cholesterol 41 and 47 mg/dL (p < 0.01) and triglycerides 136 and 172 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.01). The treatment was generally well tolerated. Three patients discontinued the therapy (drug interaction: 1; non-responder: 1; patient's decision: 1). CONCLUSION: Starting with or switching to E/C/F/TAF in PLWH effectively suppresses HIV infection, is associated with an increase in CD4 cell count and is well tolerated in a real-life setting. Renal functions remained stable during the treatment. E/C/F/TAF use was associated with an increase in LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels along with an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels.
BACKGROUND: Modest weight and lipid changes have been observed in cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting (CAB + RPV LA) phase 3/3b studies. The SOLAR study included standardized evaluations of weight and metabolic changes in people living with HIV switching to CAB + RPV LA dosed every 2 months (Q2M) vs. continuing bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF). SETTING: Phase 3b, randomized, open-label study conducted in 118 centers across 14 countries. METHODS: Participants (n = 687) were randomized 2:1; 454 switched to CAB + RPV LA Q2M and 227 continued BIC/FTC/TAF. Participants who started lipid-modifying agents or underwent cosmetic procedures were excluded. We analyzed changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), muscle mass, body fat, and proportion with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome at 1 year. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) change in body weight from baseline was -0.40 kg (-2.95 to +2.10) and +0.05 kg (-2.30 to +1.95) in the LA and BIC/FTC/TAF arm, respectively. Median (interquartile range) changes in WC and HC were +0.06 cm (-4.50 to 4.00) and +0.00 cm (-4.00 to 3.97) in the LA arm, and +1.14 cm (-3.00 to 5.09) and +0.13 cm (-3.10 to 4.00) in the BIC/FTC/TAF arm. There were no clinically relevant changes in WHtR, WHR, or the proportion with metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance in either arm. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized changes in weight, BMI, and body composition were minor and similar between participant switching to CAB + RPV LA Q2M or continuing BIC/FTC/TAF, with no clinically relevant changes in metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance.
BACKGROUND: Coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide is a single-tablet regimen and was efficacious and well tolerated in children and adolescents with HIV (aged 6 years to <18 years) in a 48-week phase 2/3 trial. In this study, we report data from children aged at least 2 years and weighing 14 kg to less than 25 kg. METHODS: We conducted this open-label, multicentre, multicohort, single-arm study in South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the USA. Participants were virologically suppressed children with HIV, aged at least 2 years, weighing 14 kg to less than 25 kg. Participants received bictegravir (30 mg), emtricitabine (120 mg), and tenofovir alafenamide (15 mg) once daily, switching to bictegravir (50 mg), emtricitabine (200 mg), and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) upon attaining a bodyweight of at least 25 kg. The study included pharmacokinetic evaluation at week 2 to confirm the dose of coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide for this weight band by comparing with previous adult data. Primary outcomes were bictegravir area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC(tau)) and concentration at the end of the dosing interval (C(tau)) at week 2, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory abnormalities until the end of week 24 in all participants who received at least one dose of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02881320. FINDINGS: Overall, 22 participants were screened (from Nov 14, 2018, to Jan 11, 2020), completed treatment with bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (until week 48), and entered an extension phase. The geometric least squares mean (GLSM) ratio for AUC(tau) for bictegravir was 7.6% higher than adults (GLSM ratio 107.6%, 90% CI 96.7-119.7); C(tau) was 34.6% lower than adults (65.4%, 49.1-87.2). Both parameters were within the target exposure range previously found in adults, children, or both". Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in four (18%) participants by the end week 24 and six (27%) by the end of week 48. Drug-related adverse events occurred in three participants (14%) by the end of week 24 and week 48; none were severe. No Grade 3-4 adverse events, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred by the end of week 24 and week 48. INTERPRETATION: Data support the use of single-tablet coformulated bictegravir (30 mg), emtricitabine (120 mg), and tenofovir alafenamide (15 mg) for treatment of HIV in children aged at least 2 years and weighing 14 kg to less than 25 kg.
