A case of haloperidol-induced bronchospasm is described, and possible etiologies are suggested. Since haloperidol is commonly used in the treatment of psychoses, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this potentially lethal yet treatable side-effect.
Haloperidol has been used extensively for the treatment of psychotic disorders, and it has been suggested that the monitoring of plasma haloperidol concentration is clinically useful. Different assay methodologies have been used in research and clinical practice to examine the relationship between response and plasma concentration of the drug. Chemical assays such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) have good precision and sensitivity; radioimmunoassay (RIA) is generally more sensitive, but less precise and specific. Radioreceptor assay quantifies dopaminereceptor blocking activity but does not provide results comparable with those of HPLC, GLC and RIA. Large doses of haloperidol can safely be given intravenously and intramuscularly for rapid neuroleptisation; the bioavailability of this agent administered orally ranges from 60 to 65%. However, there is large interindividual, but not intraindividual, variability in plasma haloperidol concentrations and most pharmacokinetic parameters. This interindividual variability could be partially explained by the reversible oxidation/reduction metabolic pathway of haloperidol: it is metabolised via reduction to reduced haloperidol, which is biologically inactive. Different extents of enterohepatic recycling, and ethnic differences in metabolism, could also account for the observed variability in haloperidol disposition. Although not conclusive from different clinical studies, it appears that a plasma haloperidol concentration range of 4 micrograms/L to an upper limit of 20 to 25 micrograms/L produces therapeutic response. The role of reduced haloperidol in determining clinical response is not clear, although in some studies a high reduced haloperidol/haloperidol concentration ratio has been suggested to be associated with therapeutic failure. Measurements of red blood cell or cerebrospinal fluid haloperidol concentration have also been proposed as determinants of therapeutic response, but results from different studies are inconsistent, and do not seem to provide a significant advantage over plasma concentration monitoring. Physiological parameters such as prolactin and homovanillic acid levels have been evaluated, with the latter showing some promise that warrants further investigation. Haloperidol decanoate can be characterised by a flip-flop pharmacokinetic model because its absorption rate constant is slower than the elimination rate constant. Its plasma concentration peaks on day 7 after intramuscular injection. The elimination half-life is about 3 weeks, and the time to steady-state is about 3 months.
Haloperidol was synthesized on the 11th of February 1958 at the Janssen Laboratories, in Belgium. Soon after its synthesis and animal studies, which suggested to Paul Janssen and his colleagues that this butyrophenone drug would be of great interest as its action was similar but much more powerful than that of chlorpromazine, haloperidol was administered to humans at the Liege hospital. The subsequent clinical studies confirmed that this new drug was particularly active against delusions and hallucinations. The introduction of haloperidol in the United States of America was difficult for clinical and legal reasons. For many years, haloperidol had been widely used in western countries, until the introduction of "new antipsychotics."
Torsades de Pointes (TDP) is a potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmia that often has a drug-induced origin. Oral, but not intravenous, haloperidol has been generally associated with this arrhythmia. The authors detail three patient cases of TDP that occurred while the patients were receiving intravenous haloperidol. The authors discuss the known risk factors for the development of TDP and review the literature on ventricular arrhythmias associated with haloperidol use.
Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Large doses of the cholinomimetic, pilocarpine, could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked. Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol. A muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine, disrupted haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine-synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium, prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol. These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems. Alternatively, activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems.
