Acute psychosis is a possible side effect of many centrally acting drugs. Its appearance is facilitated by certain conditions like advanced age, comedication, or comorbidity. We report two cases of acute psychotic syndromes with visual (Case 1 + 2) and auditory (Case 1) hallucinations under rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor. This is one of the first reports of psychotic disorders under rofecoxib intake. We present a review of the literature on mental side effects of NSAID and on the pharmacological basis of the association of cyclooxygenase-inhibitors and mental disorders.
In October UK patients who had cardiovascular events while taking rofecoxib lost the right to fight Merck in the US for compensation. But researchers and journals can still benefit from this case if they learn from the mistakes, write Harlan Krumholz and colleagues
Rofecoxib selectively inhibits cyclo-oxygenase-2 in a dose-dependent manner in humans. No significant inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 is observed with rofecoxib up to doses of 1000 mg. In 4 large double-blind randomised trials performed in patients with osteoarthritis, rofecoxib 12.5 and 25 mg/day significantly improved physical functioning, assessed using the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index and patient or investigator global assessment, compared with placebo. In addition, rofecoxib showed similar clinical efficacy to that observed with diclofenac 50 mg 3 times daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and nabumetone 1500 mg once daily. Rofecoxib is also an effective analgesic in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea or postoperative dental pain and demonstrates similar analgesic efficacy to that of naproxen sodium and ibuprofen. Rofecoxib is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events associated with rofecoxib are diarrhoea, headache, nausea and upper respiratory tract infection. There was a significantly lower incidence of upper-gastrointestinal adverse events (perforations, ulcers and bleeds) in patients with osteoarthritis receiving rofecoxib 12.5, 25 or 50 mg/day than in those receiving ibuprofen, diclofenac or nabumetone.
BACKGROUND: Each year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers). RESULTS: Rofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.
Rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck & Co., Inc.) is a new orally-effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved for treatment of acute pain, fever, primary dysmenorrhea and pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). It is also being evaluated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and adenomatous polyps of the colon. Rofecoxib is a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), thereby inhibiting prostanoid synthesis in cells that express COX-2, including inflammatory cells. As cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract principally express COX-1, a different isoform of cyclooxygenase, it is predicted that rofecoxib will have less GI toxicity than other less selective NSAIDs. In clinical trials, rofecoxib was found to be as effective as other NSAIDs for management of pain and inflammation. In trials that compare rofecoxib with ibuprofen, diclofenac and indomethacin, less GI toxicity has been observed, as assayed by a decrease in lesions visible on endoscopy, by GI blood loss and, in a meta-analysis, by frequency of serious adverse GI events. The presence of COX-2 in cells other than inflammatory cells results in side effects common among NSAIDs, including peripheral oedema and hypertension. These side effects are dose-dependent. Rofecoxib, together with other branded NSAIDs, are relatively expensive, which has led to concern regarding costs versus benefits. There is also concern regarding potential risks associated with the use of rofecoxib by populations that would otherwise not tolerate NSAIDs.
