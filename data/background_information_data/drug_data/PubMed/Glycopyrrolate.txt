BACKGROUND: Triple fixed-dose regimens of an inhaled glucocorticoid, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and a long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LABA) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been studied at single dose levels of inhaled glucocorticoid, but studies at two dose levels are lacking. METHODS: In a 52-week, phase 3, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple therapy at two dose levels of inhaled glucocorticoid in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and at least one exacerbation in the past year, we assigned patients in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive twice-daily inhaled doses of triple therapy (inhaled glucocorticoid [320 mug or 160 mug of budesonide], a LAMA [18 mug of glycopyrrolate], and a LABA [9.6 mug of formoterol]) or one of two dual therapies (18 mug of glycopyrrolate plus 9.6 mug of formoterol or 320 mug of budesonide plus 9.6 mug of formoterol). The primary end point was the annual rate (the estimated mean number per patient per year) of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, as analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population with the use of on-treatment data only. RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat population comprised 8509 patients. The annual rates of moderate or severe exacerbations were 1.08 in the 320-mug-budesonide triple-therapy group (2137 patients), 1.07 in the 160-mug-budesonide triple-therapy group (2121 patients), 1.42 in the glycopyrrolate-formoterol group (2120 patients), and 1.24 in the budesonide-formoterol group (2131 patients). The rate was significantly lower with 320-mug-budesonide triple therapy than with glycopyrrolate-formoterol (24% lower: rate ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.83; P<0.001) or budesonide-formoterol (13% lower: rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; P = 0.003). Similarly, the rate was significantly lower with 160-mug-budesonide triple therapy than with glycopyrrolate-formoterol (25% lower: rate ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83; P<0.001) or budesonide-formoterol (14% lower: rate ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; P = 0.002). The incidence of any adverse event was similar across the treatment groups (range, 61.7 to 64.5%); the incidence of confirmed pneumonia ranged from 3.5 to 4.5% in the groups that included inhaled glucocorticoid use and was 2.3% in the glycopyrrolate-formoterol group. CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with twice-daily budesonide (at either the 160-mug or 320-mug dose), glycopyrrolate, and formoterol resulted in a lower rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations than glycopyrrolate-formoterol or budesonide-formoterol.

Primary hyperhidrosis commonly affects the axillae, palms, soles, scalp, face, and groin. Patients may have multiple areas involved making localized therapy challenging. Systemic therapy may be necessary and can be used as monotherapy or combined with other hyperhidrosis treatments for optimal outcomes. Systemic therapy can also be used to treat secondary hyperhidrosis and compensatory hyperhidrosis.
Until quite recently, clinical guidelines and reviews on the treatment of hyperhidrosis advised against the use of systemic therapies based on their unacceptable adverse effects and a lack of evidence of usefulness. Numerous studies published over the past few years, however, have shown that, when used appropriately, these treatments are effective and in general have a favorable tolerability profile, making them an additional option for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, particularly for disease that is widespread, multifocal, or resistant to other treatments. In this review, the first of its kind, we examine the systemic therapies available for hyperhidrosis, including antihypertensives, psychoactive agents, and in particular oral anticholinergics, although none of these drugs are currently approved for this indication.
Hailey-Hailey disease or familial benign chronic pemphigus is a rare blistering dermatosis that is characterized by recurrent erythematous plaques with a predilection for the skin folds. For extensive Hailey-Hailey disease that is recalcitrant to conventional therapy, laser ablation, photodynamic therapy, electron beam radiotherapy, botulinum toxin type A, dermabrasion, glycopyrrolate, and afamelanotide have been reported as useful treatments, but comparative trials are lacking. This review discusses the various treatment modalities for Hailey-Hailey disease and a summary of the evidence for the most recommended treatments.
BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids have been used in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the potential benefits of their use in triple therapy are not well known. We aimed to compare the efficacy of a triple therapy with corresponding dual therapies in symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD, without a requirement for a history of exacerbations. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre phase 3 randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from hospitals and care centres in Canada, China, Japan, and the USA. Eligible patients were 40-80 years of age, were current or former smokers (with a smoking history of >/=10 pack-years), had an established clinical history of COPD, and were symptomatic for COPD, despite receiving two or more inhaled maintenance therapies for at least 6 weeks before screening. We randomly assigned patients (2:2:1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler 320/18/9.6 mug (BGF MDI), glycopyrrolate/ formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler 18/9.6 mug (GFF MDI), budesonide/formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler 320/9.6 mug (BFF MDI), or open-label budesonide/formoterol fumarate dry-powder inhaler 400/12 mug (BUD/ FORM DPI). Primary endpoints for the Europe/Canada statistical analysis approach were FEV(1) area under the curve from 0-4 h (AUC(0-4)) for BGF MDI versus BFF MDI and BGF MDI versus BUD/FORM DPI over 24 weeks; and change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV(1) for BGF MDI versus GFF MDI and non-inferiority of BFF MDI versus BUD/FORM DPI (margin of -50 mL from lower bound of 95% CI) over 24 weeks. Comparisons with BUD/FORM DPI were made for the Europe/Canada statistical analysis approach only. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02497001. FINDINGS: Between Aug 20, 2015, and Jan 5, 2018, 3047 patients were screened from 215 sites, and 1902 were randomly assigned to receive BGF MDI (n=640), GFF MDI (n=627), BFF MDI (n=316), or BUD/FORM DPI (n=319). Over 24 weeks, BGF MDI significantly improved FEV(1) AUC(0-4) versus BFF MDI (least squares mean difference 104 mL, 95% CI 77 to 131; p<0.0001) and BUD/FORM DPI (91 mL, 64 to 117; p<0.0001). BGF MDI also significantly improved pre-dose trough FEV(1) versus GFF MDI (22 mL, 4 to 39; p=0.0139) and was non-inferior to BUD/FORM DPI (-10 mL, -36 to 16; p=0.4390). At week 24, patients in the BGF MDI group had a significantly improved FEV(1) AUC(0-4) compared with patients receiving BFF MDI (116 mL, 95% CI 80 to 152; p<0.0001); there was a non-significant improvement in the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV(1) at week 24 versus GFF MDI (13 mL, -9 to 36 mL; p=0.2375). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis (n=49 [8%] in the BGF MDI group; n=41 [7%] in the GFF MDI group; n=26 [8%] in the BFF MDI group; and n=30 [9%] in the BUD/FORM DPI group) and upper respiratory tract infection (n=65 [10%]; n=38 [6%]; n=18 [6%]; and n=22 [7%]). Pneumonia incidence was low (<2%) and similar across treatments. There were two treatment-related deaths, both in the GFF MDI group. INTERPRETATION: BGF MDI was efficacious, well tolerated, and could be a more appropriate treatment than the corresponding dual therapies for symptomatic patients with moderate to very severe COPD, irrespective of exacerbation history.
