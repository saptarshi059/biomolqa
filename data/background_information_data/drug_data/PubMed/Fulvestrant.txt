BACKGROUND: In advanced oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors frequently stems from ESR1-mutated subclones, which might be sensitive to fulvestrant. The PADA-1 trial aimed to show the efficacy of an early change in therapy on the basis of a rising ESR1 mutation in blood (bESR1(mut)), while assessing the global safety of combination fulvestrant and palbociclib. METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in 83 hospitals in France. Women aged at least 18 years with oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were recruited and monitored for rising bESR1(mut) during first-line aromatase inhibitor (2.5 mg letrozole, 1 mg anastrozole, or 25 mg exemestane, orally once per day, taken continuously) and palbociclib (125 mg orally once per day on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) therapy. Patients with newly present or increased bESR1(mut) in circulating tumour DNA and no synchronous disease progression were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue with the same therapy or to switch to fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly on day 1 of each 28-day cycle and on day 15 of cycle 1) and palbociclib (dosing unchanged). The randomisation sequence was generated within an interactive web response system using a minimisation method (with an 80% random factor); patients were stratified according to visceral involvement (present or absent) and the time from inclusion to bESR1(mut) detection (<12 months or >/=12 months). The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival from random assignment, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all randomly assigned patients), and grade 3 or worse haematological adverse events in all patients. The trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03079011), and is now complete. FINDINGS: From March 22, 2017, to Jan 31, 2019, 1017 patients were included, of whom 279 (27%) developed a rising bESR1(mut) and 172 (17%) were randomly assigned to treatment: 88 to switching to fulvestrant and palbociclib and 84 patients to continuing aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib. At database lock on July 31, 2021, randomly assigned patients had a median follow-up of 35.3 months (IQR 29.2-41.4) from inclusion and 26.0 months (13.8-34.3) from random assignment. Median progression-free survival from random assignment was 11.9 months (95% CI 9.1-13.6) in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group versus 5.7 months (3.9-7.5) in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group (stratified HR 0.61, 0.43-0.86; p=0.0040). The most frequent grade 3 or worse haematological adverse events were neutropenia (715 [70.3%] of 1017 patients), lymphopenia (66 [6.5%]), and thrombocytopenia (20 [2.0%]). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in step 2 were neutropenia (35 [41.7%] of 84 patients in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group vs 39 [44.3%] of 88 patients in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group) and lymphopenia (three [3.6%] vs four [4.5%]). 31 (3.1%) patients had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events related to treatment in the overall population. Three (1.7%) of 172 patients randomly assigned had one serious adverse event in step 2: one (1.2%) grade 4 neutropenia and one (1.2%) grade 3 fatigue among 84 patients in the aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib group, and one (1.1%) grade 4 neutropenia among 88 patients in the fulvestrant and palbociclib group. One death by pulmonary embolism in step 1 was declared as being treatment related. INTERPRETATION: PADA-1 is the first prospective randomised trial showing that the early therapeutic targeting of bESR1(mut) results in significant clinical benefit. Additionally, the original design explored in PADA-1 might help with tackling acquired resistance with new drugs in future trials. FUNDING: Pfizer.
Fulvestrant is used to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, but acquired resistance is poorly understood. PlasmaMATCH Cohort A (NCT03182634) investigated the activity of fulvestrant in patients with activating ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Baseline ESR1 mutations Y537S are associated with poor outcomes and Y537C with good outcomes. Sequencing of baseline and EOT ctDNA samples (n = 69) revealed 3/69 (4%) patients acquired novel ESR1 F404 mutations (F404L, F404I, and F404V), in cis with activating mutations. In silico modeling revealed that ESR1 F404 contributes to fulvestrant binding to estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) through a pi-stacking bond, with mutations disrupting this bond. In vitro analysis demonstrated that single F404L, E380Q, and D538G models were less sensitive to fulvestrant, whereas compound mutations D538G + F404L and E380Q + F404L were resistant. Several oral ERalpha degraders were active against compound mutant models. We have identified a resistance mechanism specific to fulvestrant that can be targeted by treatments in clinical development. SIGNIFICANCE: Novel F404 ESR1 mutations may be acquired to cause overt resistance to fulvestrant when combined with preexisting activating ESR1 mutations. Novel combinations of mutations in the ER ligand binding domain may cause drug-specific resistance, emphasizing the potential of similar drug-specific mutations to impact the efficacy of oral ER degraders in development.

CDK4/6 inhibition with endocrine therapy is now a standard of care for advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Mechanisms of CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance have been described preclinically, with limited evidence from clinical samples. We conducted paired baseline and end-of-treatment circulating tumor DNA sequencing from 195 patients in the PALOMA-3 randomized phase III trial of palbociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant. We show that clonal evolution occurs frequently during treatment, reflecting substantial subclonal complexity in breast cancer that has progressed after prior endocrine therapy. RB1 mutations emerged only in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and in a minority of patients (6/127, 4.7%, P = 0.041). New driver mutations emerged in PIK3CA (P = 0.00069) and ESR1 after treatment in both arms, in particular ESR1 Y537S (P = 0.0037). Evolution of driver gene mutations was uncommon in patients progressing early on palbociclib plus fulvestrant but common in patients progressing later on treatment. These findings inform future treatment strategies to address resistance to palbociclib plus fulvestrant.Significance: Acquired mutations from fulvestrant are a major driver of resistance to fulvestrant and palbociclib combination therapy. ESR1 Y537S mutation promotes resistance to fulvestrant. Clonal evolution results in frequent acquisition of driver mutations in patients progressing late on therapy, which suggests that early and late progression have distinct mechanisms of resistance.

BACKGROUND: Capivasertib, an AKT inhibitor, added to fulvestrant, was previously reported to improve progression-free survival in women with aromatase inhibitor-resistant oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The benefit appeared to be independent of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) pathway alteration status of tumours, as ascertained using assays available at the time. Here, we report updated progression-free survival and overall survival results, and a prespecified examination of the effect of PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway alterations identified by an expanded genetic testing panel on treatment outcomes. METHODS: This randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial recruited postmenopausal adult women aged at least 18 years with ER-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic or locally advanced inoperable breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, who had relapsed or progressed on an aromatase inhibitor, from across 19 hospitals in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg (day 1) every 28 days (plus a 500 mg loading dose on day 15 of cycle 1) with either capivasertib 400 mg or matching placebo, orally twice daily on an intermittent weekly schedule of 4 days on and 3 days off, starting on cycle 1 day 15. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. Treatment was allocated by an interactive web-response system using a minimisation method (with a 20% random element) and the following minimisation factors: measurable or non-measurable disease, primary or secondary aromatase inhibitor resistance, PIK3CA status, and PTEN status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints shown in this Article were overall survival and safety in the intention-to-treat population, and the effect of tumour PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway status identified by an expanded testing panel that included next-generation sequencing assays. Recruitment is complete. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01992952. FINDINGS: Between March 16, 2015, and March 6, 2018, 183 participants were screened for eligibility and 140 (77%) were randomly assigned to receive fulvestrant plus capivasertib (n=69) or fulvestrant plus placebo (n=71). Median follow-up at the data cut-off of Nov 25, 2021, was 58.5 months (IQR 45.9-64.1) for participants treated with fulvestrant plus capivasertib and 62.3 months (IQR 62.1-70.3) for fulvestrant plus placebo. Updated median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% CI 5.0-13.4) in the group receiving fulvestrant plus capivasertib compared with 4.8 months (3.1-7.9) for fulvestrant plus placebo (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56 [95% CI 0.38-0.81]; two-sided p=0.0023). Median overall survival in the capivasertib versus placebo groups was 29.3 months (95% CI 23.7-39.0) versus 23.4 months (18.7-32.7; adjusted HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.45-0.97]; two-sided p=0.035). The expanded biomarker panel identified an expanded pathway-altered subgroup that contained 76 participants (54% of the intention-to-treat population). Median progression-free survival in the expanded pathway-altered subgroup for participants receiving capivasertib (n=39) was 12.8 months (95% CI 6.6-18.8) compared with 4.6 months (2.8-7.9) in the placebo group (n=37; adjusted HR 0.44 [95% CI 0.26-0.72]; two-sided p=0.0014). Median overall survival for the expanded pathway-altered subgroup receiving capivasertib was 38.9 months (95% CI 23.3-50.7) compared with 20.0 months (14.8-31.4) for those receiving placebo (adjusted HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.27-0.79]; two-sided p=0.0047). By contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in progression-free or overall survival in the expanded pathway non-altered subgroup treated with capivasertib (n=30) versus placebo (n=34). One additional serious adverse event (pneumonia) in the capivasertib group had occurred subsequent to the primary analysis. One death, due to atypical pulmonary infection, was assessed as possibly related to capivasertib treatment. INTERPRETATION: Updated FAKTION data showed that capivasertib addition to fulvestrant extends the survival of participants with aromatase inhibitor-resistant ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The expanded biomarker testing suggested that capivasertib predominantly benefits patients with PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway-altered tumours. Phase 3 data are needed to substantiate the results, including in patients with previous CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure who were not included in the FAKTION trial.

Blockade of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 pathway has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). We report the interim results of DAWNA-1 ( NCT03927456 ), a double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trial of dalpiciclib (a new cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor) plus fulvestrant in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative ABC with disease progression after endocrine therapy. A total of 361 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. The study met the primary end point, showing significantly prolonged investigator-assessed progression-free survival with dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant (median = 15.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.1-not reached versus 7.2, 95% CI = 5.6-9.2 months; hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.31-0.58; one-sided P < 0.0001 (boundary was P </= 0.008)). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events with dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant were neutropenia (84.2%) and leukopenia (62.1%). The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.8% with dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant versus 6.7% with placebo plus fulvestrant. Our findings support dalpiciclib plus fulvestrant as a new treatment option for pretreated hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative ABC.
BACKGROUND: Capivasertib is a potent, selective pan-AKT inhibitor. In CAPItello-291, the addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant resulted in a statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvement in progression-free survival over fulvestrant monotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer and disease progression on or after aromatase inhibitor-based therapy. Characterization of the capivasertib-fulvestrant adverse event (AE) profile as managed in CAPItello-291 can inform future management guidance and optimize clinical benefit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and eight patients were randomized 1 : 1 to capivasertib (400 mg twice daily; 4 days on, 3 days off) or placebo, plus fulvestrant, on a 4-week cycle. Dose reductions/interruptions for capivasertib/placebo were permitted (up to two dose reductions). Safety analyses included exposure, AE, and clinical laboratory data and were conducted in patients who received at least one dose of capivasertib, fulvestrant, or placebo. Frequent AEs associated with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase (AKT) pathway inhibition (diarrhea, rash, hyperglycemia) were characterized using group terms. AEs were summarized using descriptive statistics; time-to-event analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Safety analyses included 705 patients: capivasertib-fulvestrant (n = 355) and placebo-fulvestrant (n = 350). Frequent any-grade AEs with capivasertib-fulvestrant were diarrhea (72.4%), rash (38.0%), and nausea (34.6%); frequent grade >/=3 AEs were rash (12.1%), diarrhea (9.3%), and hyperglycemia (2.3%). Diarrhea, rash, and hyperglycemia occurred shortly after starting capivasertib-fulvestrant [median days to onset (interquartile range) of any grade: 8 (2-22), 12 (10-15), and 15 (1-51), respectively], and were managed with supportive medications, dose reductions, interruptions, and/or discontinuation. Discontinuation rates were 2.0%, 4.5%, and 0.3%, respectively. Overall, 13.0% discontinued capivasertib due to AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent AEs associated with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition occurred early and were manageable. The low rate of treatment discontinuations suggests that, when appropriately managed, these AEs do not pose a challenge to clinical benefit.
Fulvestrant is a 7alpha-alkylsulphinyl analogue of estradiol that competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to the estrogen receptor. Once bound to the receptor, fulvestrant attenuates receptor dimerisation, effecting a rapid degradation of the estrogen receptor protein and inhibition of transcription. Fulvestrant is a potent inhibitor of the growth of human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. It has demonstrated pure anti-estrogenic activity in animal systems. Intramuscular fulvestrant 250 mg once a month was as effective as the oral aromatase inhibitor anastrozole 1 mg/day in 2 phase III trials in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had received prior endocrine therapy. Median time to disease progression (the primary end-point) with fulvestrant and anastrozole was 5.4 and 3.4 months (North American trial) and 5.5 and 5.1 months (European trial). The median duration of response was 19.3 and 10.5 months (North American trial) and 14.3 and 14.0 months (European trial). The most common adverse events with fulvestrant are gastrointestinal disturbances and hot flushes. Fulvestrant showed similar tolerability to anastrozole in 2 phase III trials.
PURPOSE: Despite promising activity in hematopoietic malignancies, efficacy of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax in solid tumors is unknown. We report the prespecified VERONICA primary results, a randomized phase II clinical trial evaluating venetoclax and fulvestrant in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, post-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre-/postmenopausal females >/=18 years were randomized 1:1 to venetoclax (800 mg orally daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular; cycle 1: days 1 and 15; subsequent 28-day cycles: day 1) or fulvestrant alone. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety. Exploratory biomarker analyses included BCL2 and BCL extra-large (BCLXL) tumor expression, and PIK3CA circulating tumor DNA mutational status. RESULTS: At primary analysis (cutoff: August 5, 2020; n = 103), venetoclax did not significantly improve CBR [venetoclax plus fulvestrant: 11.8% (n = 6/51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.44-23.87); fulvestrant: 13.7% (7/51; 5.70-26.26); risk difference -1.96% (95% CI, -16.86 to 12.94)]. Median PFS was 2.69 months (95% CI, 1.94-3.71) with venetoclax plus fulvestrant versus 1.94 months (1.84-3.55) with fulvestrant (stratified HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61-1.45; P = 0.7853). Overall survival data were not mature. A nonsignificant improvement of CBR and PFS was observed in patients whose tumors had strong BCL2 expression (IHC 3+), a BCL2/BCLXL Histoscore ratio >/=1, or PIK3CA-wild-type status. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not indicate clinical utility for venetoclax plus fulvestrant in endocrine therapy-resistant, CDK4/6 inhibitor-refractory metastatic breast tumors, but suggest possible increased dependence on BCLXL in this setting.
PURPOSE: Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is) are an important component of treatment for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but it is not known if patients might derive benefit from continuation of CDK4/6i with endocrine therapy beyond initial tumor progression or if the addition of checkpoint inhibitor therapy has value in this setting. METHODS: The randomized multicenter phase II PACE trial enrolled patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2- MBC whose disease had progressed on previous CDK4/6i and aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2:1 to receive fulvestrant (F), fulvestrant plus palbociclib (F + P), or fulvestrant plus palbociclib and avelumab (F + P + A). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with F versus F + P. RESULTS: Overall, 220 patients were randomly assigned between September 2017 and February 2022. The median age was 57 years (range, 25-83 years). Most patients were postmenopausal (80.9%), and 40% were originally diagnosed with de novo MBC. Palbociclib was the most common previous CDK4/6i (90.9%). The median PFS was 4.8 months on F and 4.6 months on F + P (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 [90% CI, 0.79 to 1.55]; P = .62). The median PFS on F + P + A was 8.1 months (HR v F, 0.75 [90% CI, 0.50 to 1.12]; P = .23). The difference in PFS with F + P and F + P + A versus F was greater among patients with baseline ESR1 and PIK3CA alterations. CONCLUSION: The addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant did not improve PFS versus fulvestrant alone among patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2- MBC whose disease had progressed on a previous CDK4/6i plus AI. The increased PFS seen with the addition of avelumab warrants further investigation in this patient population.
Purpose This phase III study evaluated ribociclib plus fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer who were treatment naive or had received up to one line of prior endocrine therapy in the advanced setting. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to ribociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary end point was locally assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, overall response rate, and safety. Results A total of 484 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to ribociclib plus fulvestrant, and 242 were assigned to placebo plus fulvestrant. Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with ribociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant: 20.5 months (95% CI, 18.5 to 23.5 months) versus 12.8 months (95% CI, 10.9 to 16.3 months), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.593; 95% CI, 0.480 to 0.732; P < .001). Consistent treatment effects were observed in patients who were treatment naive in the advanced setting (hazard ratio, 0.577; 95% CI, 0.415 to 0.802), as well as in patients who had received up to one line of prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease (hazard ratio, 0.565; 95% CI, 0.428 to 0.744). Among patients with measurable disease, the overall response rate was 40.9% for the ribociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 28.7% for placebo plus fulvestrant. Grade 3 adverse events reported in >/= 10% of patients in either arm (ribociclib plus fulvestrant v placebo plus fulvestrant) were neutropenia (46.6% v 0%) and leukopenia (13.5% v 0%); the only grade 4 event reported in >/= 5% of patients was neutropenia (6.8% v 0%). Conclusion Ribociclib plus fulvestrant might represent a new first- or second-line treatment option in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.
Purpose The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus targets aberrant signaling through the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, a mechanism of resistance to anti-estrogen therapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. We hypothesized that everolimus plus the selective ER downregulator fulvestrant would be more efficacious than fulvestrant alone in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study included 131 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer randomly assigned to fulvestrant (500 mg days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of cycles 2 and beyond) plus everolimus or placebo. The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% improvement in median progression-free survival from 5.4 months to 9.2 months. Secondary end points included objective response and clinical benefit rate (response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). Prophylactic corticosteroid mouth rinses were not used. Results The addition of everolimus to fulvestrant improved the median progression-free survival from 5.1 to 10.3 months (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92]; stratified log-rank P = .02), indicating that the primary trial end point was met. Objective response rates were similar (18.2% v 12.3%; P = .47), but the clinical benefit rate was significantly higher in the everolimus arm (63.6% v 41.5%; P = .01). Adverse events of all grades occurred more often in the everolimus arm, including oral mucositis (53% v 12%), fatigue (42% v 22%), rash (38% v 5%), anemia (31% v. 6%), diarrhea (23% v 8%), hyperglycemia (19% v 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (17% v 3%), and pneumonitis (17% v 0%), although grade 3 to 4 events were uncommon. Conclusion Everolimus enhances the efficacy of fulvestrant in AI-resistant, ER-positive metastatic breast cancer.
PURPOSE: The monarcHER trial has shown that abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor, combined with fulvestrant and trastuzumab, improves progression-free survival (PFS) in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer (ABC) compared with standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab. We report the final overall survival (OS) analysis, updated safety and efficacy data, and exploratory biomarker results from monarcHER. PATIENTS AND METHODS: monarcHER (NCT02675231), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase II trial, enrolled 237 patients across Arm A (abemaciclib, trastuzumab, fulvestrant), Arm B (abemaciclib, trastuzumab), and Arm C (SOC chemotherapy, trastuzumab). Following the statistical plan, OS and PFS were estimated in all arms. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on archival tissue. RESULTS: Median OS was 31.1 months in Arm A, 29.2 months in Arm B, and 20.7 months in Arm C [A vs. C: HR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48-1.05; nominal two-sided P value 0.086; B vs. C: HR 0.83 (95% CI, 0.57-1.23); nominal two-sided P value 0.365]. Updated PFS and safety findings were consistent with previous results. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, neutrophil count decrease, and anemia. In exploratory RNA-seq analyses, Luminal subtypes were associated with longer PFS [8.6 vs. 5.4 months (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.79)] and OS [31.7 vs. 19.7 months (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-1.00)] compared with non-Luminal. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase II trial, abemaciclib + trastuzumab +/- fulvestrant numerically improved median OS in women with HR+, HER2+ ABC compared with SOC chemotherapy + trastuzumab.
BACKGROUND: Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway via PIK3CA mutations occurs in 28%-46% of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancers (ABCs) and is associated with poor prognosis. The SOLAR-1 trial showed that the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant treatment provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2- ABC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men and postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC whose disease progressed on or after aromatase inhibitor (AI) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive alpelisib (300 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg every 28 days and once on day 15) or placebo plus fulvestrant. Overall survival (OS) in the PIK3CA-mutant cohort was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methodology and a one-sided stratified log-rank test was carried out with an O'Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary of P </= 0.0161. RESULTS: In the PIK3CA-mutated cohort (n = 341), median OS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 39.3 months (34.1-44.9) for alpelisib-fulvestrant and 31.4 months (26.8-41.3) for placebo-fulvestrant [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.86 (95% CI, 0.64-1.15; P = 0.15)]. OS results did not cross the prespecified efficacy boundary. Median OS (95% CI) in patients with lung and/or liver metastases was 37.2 months (28.7-43.6) and 22.8 months (19.0-26.8) in the alpelisib-fulvestrant and placebo-fulvestrant arms, respectively [HR = 0.68 (0.46-1.00)]. Median times to chemotherapy (95% CI) for the alpelisib-fulvestrant and placebo-fulvestrant arms were 23.3 months (15.2-28.4) and 14.8 months (10.5-22.6), respectively [HR = 0.72 (0.54-0.95)]. No new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although the analysis did not cross the prespecified boundary for statistical significance, there was a 7.9-month numeric improvement in median OS when alpelisib was added to fulvestrant treatment of patients with PIK3CA-mutated, HR+, HER2- ABC. Overall, these results further support the statistically significant prolongation of PFS observed with alpelisib plus fulvestrant in this population, which has a poor prognosis due to a PIK3CA mutation.

PURPOSE: To conduct an updated exploratory analysis of overall survival (OS) with a longer median follow-up of 73.3 months and evaluate the prognostic value of molecular analysis by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) were randomized 2:1 to receive palbociclib (125 mg orally/day; 3/1 week schedule) and fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or placebo and fulvestrant. This OS analysis was performed when 75% of enrolled patients died (393 events in 521 randomized patients). ctDNA analysis was performed among patients who provided consent. RESULTS: At the data cutoff (August 17, 2020), 258 and 135 deaths occurred in the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. The median OS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 34.8 months (28.8-39.9) in the palbociclib group and 28.0 months (23.5-33.8) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65-0.99). The 6-year OS rate (95% CI) was 19.1% (14.9-23.7) and 12.9% (8.0-19.1) in the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. Favorable OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant was observed in most subgroups, particularly in patients with endocrine-sensitive disease, no prior chemotherapy for ABC and low circulating tumor fraction and regardless of ESR1, PIK3CA, or TP53 mutation status. No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The clinically meaningful improvement in OS associated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant was maintained with >6 years of follow-up in patients with HR+/HER2- ABC, supporting palbociclib plus fulvestrant as a standard of care in these patients.
BACKGROUND: In an earlier analysis of this phase 3 trial, ribociclib plus fulvestrant showed a greater benefit with regard to progression-free survival than fulvestrant alone in postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. Here we report the results of a protocol-specified second interim analysis of overall survival. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ribociclib or placebo in addition to fulvestrant as first-line or second-line treatment. Survival was evaluated by means of a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: This analysis was based on 275 deaths: 167 among 484 patients (34.5%) receiving ribociclib and 108 among 242 (44.6%) receiving placebo. Ribociclib plus fulvestrant showed a significant overall survival benefit over placebo plus fulvestrant. The estimated overall survival at 42 months was 57.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.0 to 63.2) in the ribociclib group and 45.9% (95% CI, 36.9 to 54.5) in the placebo group, for a 28% difference in the relative risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.92; P = 0.00455). The benefit was consistent across most subgroups. In a descriptive update, median progression-free survival among patients receiving first-line treatment was 33.6 months (95% CI, 27.1 to 41.3) in the ribociclib group and 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.9 to 23.6) in the placebo group. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ribociclib plus fulvestrant showed a significant overall survival benefit over placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: In the PALOMA-3 study, the combination of the CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib and fulvestrant was associated with significant improvements in progression-free survival compared with fulvestrant plus placebo in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Identification of patients most suitable for the addition of palbociclib to endocrine therapy after tumour recurrence is crucial for treatment optimisation in metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to confirm our earlier findings with this extended follow-up and show our results for subgroup and biomarker analyses. METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 study, women aged 18 years or older with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that had progressed on previous endocrine therapy were stratified by sensitivity to previous hormonal therapy, menopausal status, and presence of visceral metastasis at 144 centres in 17 countries. Eligible patients-ie, any menopausal status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, measurable disease or bone disease only, and disease relapse or progression after previous endocrine therapy for advanced disease during treatment or within 12 months of completion of adjuvant therapy-were randomly assigned (2:1) via a centralised interactive web-based and voice-based randomisation system to receive oral palbociclib (125 mg daily for 3 weeks followed by a week off over 28-day cycles) plus 500 mg fulvestrant (intramuscular injection on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1; then on day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles) or placebo plus fulvestrant. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. We also assessed endocrine therapy resistance by clinical parameters, quantitative hormone-receptor expression, and tumour PIK3CA mutational status in circulating DNA at baseline. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01942135. FINDINGS: Between Oct 7, 2013, and Aug 26, 2014, 521 patients were randomly assigned, 347 to fulvestrant plus palbociclib and 174 to fulvestrant plus placebo. Study enrolment is closed and overall survival follow-up is in progress. By March 16, 2015, 259 progression-free-survival events had occurred (145 in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 114 in the fulvestrant plus placebo group); median follow-up was 8.9 months (IQR 8.7-9.2). Median progression-free survival was 9.5 months (95% CI 9.2-11.0) in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 4.6 months (3.5-5.6) in the fulvestrant plus placebo group (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.59, p<0.0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 251 (73%) of 345 patients in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 38 (22%) of 172 patients in the fulvestrant plus placebo group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (223 [65%] in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and one [1%] in the fulvestrant plus placebo group), anaemia (ten [3%] and three [2%]), and leucopenia (95 [28%] and two [1%]). Serious adverse events (all causalities) occurred in 44 patients (13%) of 345 in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group and 30 (17%) of 172 patients in the fulvestrant plus placebo group. PIK3CA mutation was detected in the plasma DNA of 129 (33%) of 395 patients for whom these data were available. Neither PIK3CA status nor hormone-receptor expression level significantly affected treatment response. INTERPRETATION: Fulvestrant plus palbociclib was associated with significant and consistent improvement in progression-free survival compared with fulvestrant plus placebo, irrespective of the degree of endocrine resistance, hormone-receptor expression level, and PIK3CA mutational status. The combination could be considered as a therapeutic option for patients with recurrent hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on previous endocrine therapy.

BACKGROUND: Ribociclib plus fulvestrant demonstrated significant progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) benefits in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). Here we present a new landmark in survival follow-up for a phase III cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitor clinical trial in patients with ABC (median, 56.3 months). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 174 sites (30 countries). Patients were men and postmenopausal women (age >/=18 years) with histologically/cytologically confirmed HR+/HER2- ABC. Patients could have received </=1 line of endocrine therapy (ET) but no chemotherapy for ABC. Patients, assigned 2:1, were stratified by the presence/absence of liver/lung metastases and previous ET. Patients received intramuscular fulvestrant (500 mg, day 1 of each 28-day cycle plus day 15 of cycle 1) with oral ribociclib (600 mg/day, 3 weeks on, 1 week off) or placebo. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in patients receiving >/=1 dose study treatment. OS was a secondary endpoint. MONALEESA-3 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02422615; no longer enrolling). RESULTS: Between 18 June 2015 and 10 June 2016, 726 patients were randomly assigned (484, ribociclib; 242, placebo). At data cut-off (30 October 2020), median OS (mOS) was 53.7 months (ribociclib) versus 41.5 months (placebo) [hazard ratio (HR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.90]. Subgroup analyses were consistent with overall population. In the first-line setting, most patients in the ribociclib arm ( approximately 60%) lived longer than median follow-up; mOS was 51.8 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.46-0.88). In the second-line setting, mOS was 39.7 months (ribociclib) versus 33.7 months (placebo) (HR, 0.78; 95% CI 0.59-1.04). No apparent drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and fulvestrant or new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis reported extended OS follow-up in MONALEESA-3. mOS was  approximately 12 months longer in patients with HR+/HER2- ABC treated with ribociclib plus fulvestrant compared with fulvestrant monotherapy.
IMPORTANCE: Statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefits of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors in combination with fulvestrant for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC) in patients regardless of menopausal status after prior endocrine therapy (ET) has not yet been demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant on OS at the prespecified interim of MONARCH 2 (338 events) in patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative advanced breast cancer that progressed during prior ET. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: MONARCH 2 was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant vs placebo plus fulvestrant for treatment of premenopausal or perimenopausal women (with ovarian suppression) and postmenopausal women with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative ABC that progressed during ET. Patients were enrolled between August 7, 2014, and December 29, 2015. Analyses for this report were conducted at the time of database lock on June 20, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo, 150 mg, every 12 hours on a continuous schedule plus fulvestrant, 500 mg, per label. Randomization was stratified based on site of metastasis (visceral, bone only, or other) and resistance to prior ET (primary vs secondary). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Overall survival was a gated key secondary end point. The boundary P value for the interim analysis was .02. RESULTS: Of 669 women enrolled, 446 (median [range] age, 59 [32-91] years) were randomized to the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant arm and 223 (median [range] age, 62 [32-87] years) were randomized to the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. At the prespecified interim, 338 deaths (77% of the planned 441 at the final analysis) were observed in the intent-to-treat population, with a median OS of 46.7 months for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant and 37.3 months for placebo plus fulvestrant (hazard ratio [HR], 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606-0.945; P = .01). Improvement in OS was consistent across all stratification factors. Among stratification factors, more pronounced effects were observed in patients with visceral disease (HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.511-0.891) and primary resistance to prior ET (HR, 0.686; 95% CI, 0.451-1.043). Time to second disease progression (median, 23.1 months vs 20.6 months), time to chemotherapy (median, 50.2 months vs 22.1 months), and chemotherapy-free survival (median, 25.5 months vs 18.2 months) were also statistically significantly improved in the abemaciclib arm vs placebo arm. No new safety signals were observed for abemaciclib. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful median OS improvement of 9.4 months for patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative ABC who progressed after prior ET regardless of menopausal status. Abemaciclib substantially delayed the receipt of subsequent chemotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02107703.
We present an autopsy case of hepatic thrombotic portal venopathy resulting in decompensated liver failure and death which occurred rapidly after commencing abemaciclib and fulvestrant chemotherapy for advanced invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically. This is the first reported case of such a finding. We suggest that further cases displaying this previously unpublished pattern are collated in order that we may begin to investigate the underlying etiological mediators.
MONARCH 2 is a global, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study of abemaciclib/placebo + fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer. The East Asian population comprised 212 (31.7%) of the 669 intent-to-treat population in the MONARCH 2 trial. Consistent with the primary analysis, this subpopulation analysis of East Asian patients indicated progression-free survival benefit in the abemaciclib arm. The median overall survival was not reached in the abemaciclib arm and was 48.9 months in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.52-1.24; p = 0.377). In addition, other efficacy endpoints, including time to chemotherapy, chemotherapy free survival, and time to second disease progression, indicated benefit in the abemaciclib arm. This analysis found no new safety concerns with longer follow-up. These findings support the positive benefit-risk balance of the MONARCH 2 regimen in East Asian patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.
