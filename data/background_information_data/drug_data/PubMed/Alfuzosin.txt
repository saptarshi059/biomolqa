Drug-induced hepatic injury is a potential complication of virtually all drugs because the liver is central to the metabolic disposition of almost all drugs, although precise mechanisms often are unknown. We report a case of severe acute mixed hepatitis (cholestatic and hepatocellular), probably induced by alfuzosin. This event has not been reported previously (MEDLINE 1990, March 1999). Viral causes, autoimmune hepatitis and biliary tree obstruction were excluded. After discontinuation of the drug, liver function test results returned to normal.
Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) are efficacious in treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), also termed symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), causing bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). There is little difference among the various alpha-blockers in terms of efficacy in treating LUTS. However, conventional quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin, originally developed for hypertension, have inherent cardiovascular extension effects, which influence the well being and safety of patients with LUTS by impairing physiological blood pressure (BP) control, even when their effect on unchallenged BP may be quite low. Preclinically, tamsulosin, a sulphonamide-substituted phenethylamine, has a relative selectivity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptors of the lower urinary tract. Clinically, this is associated with fewer cardiovascular extension effects with tamsulosin (modified release capsule) 0.4 mg once daily. This allows the use of convenient regimens of 0.4 mg tamsulosin administered once daily after breakfast from initiation of treatment without the need for 'step-up' increases of dose to avoid 'first-dose' hypotension. Extensive investigation, including multiple orthostatic stress testing (which otherwise is unusual in the characterization of alpha-blockers because of their inherent safety), confirms that tamsulosin 0.4 mg definitely carries a lower risk of impaired BP control.
PURPOSE: To describe the otorhinolaryngological adverse effects of the main drugs used in urological practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the scientific literature was performed using a combination of specific descriptors (side effect, adverse effect, scopolamine, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, oxybutynin, tolterodine, spironolactone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, doxazosin, alfuzosin, terazosin, prazosin, tamsulosin, desmopressin) contained in publications until April 2020. Manuscripts written in English, Portuguese, and Spanish were manually selected from the title and abstract. The main drugs used in Urology were divided into five groups to describe their possible adverse effects: alpha-blockers, anticholinergics, diuretics, hormones, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. RESULTS: The main drugs used in Urology may cause several otorhinolaryngological adverse effects. Dizziness was most common, but dry mouth, rhinitis, nasal congestion, epistaxis, hearing loss, tinnitus, and rhinorrhea were also reported and varies among drug classes. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the drugs used in urological practice have otorhinolaryngological adverse effects. Dizziness was most common, but dry mouth, rhinitis, nasal congestion, epistaxis, hearing loss, tinnitus, and rhinorrhea were also reported. Therefore, doctors must be aware of these adverse effects to improve adherence to the treatment and to minimize damage to the health of patients.
Four alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists are currently available for the medical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction in Germany: alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin. Indirect comparison based on randomized, placebo-controlled trials as well as several direct comparative studies have shown equal efficacy of all four drugs on urinary flow and symptom relief if suggested dosing regimens are applied. A dosing regimen below this recommendation should be restricted to those patients who have a proven satisfactory response to a lower dose.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Terazosin, doxazosin, and alfuzosin (Tz/Dz/Az) are alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists that also bind to and activate a key adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-producing enzyme in glycolysis. It is hypothesized that the increase in energy availability in the brain may slow or prevent neurodegeneration, potentially by reducing the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Recent work has suggested a potentially neuroprotective effect of the use of Tz/Dz/Az in Parkinson disease in both animal and human studies. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of Tz/Dz/Az in a closely related disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: We used a new-user active comparator design in the Merative Marketscan database to identify men with no history of DLB who were newly started on Tz/Dz/Az or 2 comparator medications. Our comparator medications were other drugs commonly used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia that do not increase ATP: the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist tamsulosin or 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI). We matched the cohorts on propensity scores and duration of follow-up. We followed up the matched cohorts forward to estimate the hazard of developing DLB using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Men who were newly started on Tz/Dz/Az had a lower hazard of developing DLB than matched men taking tamsulosin (n = 242,716, 728,256 person-years, hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.50-0.71) or 5ARI (n = 130,872, 399,316 person-years, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.93). while the hazard in men taking tamsulosin was similar to that of men taking 5ARI (n = 159,596, 482,280 person-years, HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96-1.42). These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: We find an association in men who are taking Tz/Dz/Az and a lower hazard of DLB compared with similar men taking other medications. When combined with the literature of Tz/Dz/Az on Parkinson disease, our findings suggest that glycolysis-enhancing drugs may be broadly protective in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies. A future randomized trial is required to assess these associations for causality. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that Tz/Dz/Az use reduces the rate of developing DLB in adult men.
