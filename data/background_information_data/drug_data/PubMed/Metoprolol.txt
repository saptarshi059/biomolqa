BACKGROUND: Metoprolol is recommended for therapeutic use in multiple cardiovascular conditions, thyroid crisis, and circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. A detailed systematic review on the metoprolol literature would be beneficial to assess all pharmacokinetic parameters in humans and their respective effects on patients with hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular diseases. This review combines all the pharmacokinetic data on metoprolol from various accessible studies, which may assist in clinical decision making. METHODOLOGY: The Google Scholar and PubMed databases were searched to screen articles associated with the clinical pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The comprehensive literature search retrieved 41 articles including data on plasma concentration-time profiles after intravenous and oral (immediate-release, controlled-release, slow-release, or extended-release) routes of administration, and at least one pharmacokinetic parameter was reported in all studies included. RESULTS: Out of 41 retrieved articles, six were after intravenous and 12 were after oral administration in healthy individuals. The oral studies depict a dose-dependent increase in maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T(max)), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Two studies were conducted in R- and S-enantiomers, in which one study reported the gender differences, depicting greater C(max) and AUC among women, whereas in another study S-metoprolol was found to have higher values of C(max), T(max), and AUC in comparison with R-metoprolol. Results in different diseases depicted that after IV administration of 20 mg, patients with renal impairment showed an increase in clearance (CL) (60 L/h vs 48 L/h) compared with healthy subjects, whereas a decrease in CL (36.6 +/- 7.8 L/h vs 48 +/- 6.6 L/h) was seen in patients with hepatic cirrhosis at a similar dose. In comparison with a single oral dose following administration of 15 mg IV in three divided doses, patients having an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) showed an increase in C(max) (823 nmol/L vs 248 nmol/L) at a steady state. Twenty different studies have reported significant changes in CL, C(max,) and AUC of metoprolol when it is co-administered with other drugs. One study has reported a drug-food interaction for metoprolol but no significant changes were seen in the C(max) and AUC. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes all the pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol after pooling up-to-date data from all the studies available. The summarized pharmacokinetic data presented in this review can assist in developing and evaluating pharmacokinetic models of metoprolol. Moreover, this data can provide practitioners with an insight into dosage adjustments among the diseased populations and can assist in preventing potential adverse drug reactions. This review can also help avoid side effects and drug-drug interactions.
The effect of metoprolol on mortality was compared with that of placebo in a double blind randomised trial in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with metoprolol or placebo started as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in hospital and was continued for 90 days. Metoprolol was given as a 15 mg intravenous dose followed by oral administration of 100 mg twice daily. 1395 patients (697 on placebo and 698 on metoprolol) were included in the trial. Definite acute myocardial infarction developed in 809 and probable infarction in 162. Patients were allocated to various risk groups and within each group patients were randomly assigned to treatment with metoprolol or placebo. There were 62 deaths in the placebo group (8.9%) and 40 deaths in the metoprolol group (5.7%), a reduction of 36% (p less than 0.03). Mortality rates are given according to the treatment group to which the patients were initially randomly allocated.
BACKGROUND: Diltiazem (calcium channel blocker) and metoprolol (beta-blocker) are both commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation/flutter (AFF) in the emergency department (ED). However, there is considerable regional variability in emergency physician practice patterns and debate among physicians as to which agent is more effective. To date, only one small prospective, randomized trial has compared the effectiveness of diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control of AFF in the ED and concluded no difference in effectiveness between the two agents. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of diltiazem with metoprolol for rate control of AFF in the ED. METHODS: A convenience sample of adult patients presenting with rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter was randomly assigned to receive either diltiazem or metoprolol. The study team monitored each subject's systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rates for 30 min. RESULTS: In the first 5 min, 50.0% of the diltiazem group and 10.7% of the metoprolol group reached the target heart rate (HR) of <100 beats per minute (bpm) (p < 0.005). By 30 min, 95.8% of the diltiazem group and 46.4% of the metoprolol group reached the target HR < 100 bpm (p < 0.0001). Mean decrease in HR for the diltiazem group was more rapid and substantial than that of the metoprolol group. From a safety perspective, there was no difference between the groups with respect to hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) and bradycardia (HR < 60 bpm). CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem was more effective in achieving rate control in ED patients with AFF and did so with no increased incidence of adverse effects.
A 27-year-old man presented with an intentional overdose of concentrated caffeine powder that he bought over the internet. The patient received benzodiazepines and ondansetron for symptomatic treatment when he arrived in the Emergency Department (ED). Subsequently, he developed recurrent supraventricular tachycardia in the ED. The SVT was successfully treated with metoprolol. The patient's caffeine level was >90â€¯mg/L. This is the first known report of treatment of caffeine-induced supraventricular tachycardia with metoprolol.
The tremor of a patient with debilitating essential tremor who could not take propranolol (because of severe asthma) was dramatically reduced when metoprolol tartrate was administered in standard doses. Metoprolol appears to be an excellent alternative antitremor drug to propranolol in such patients.
