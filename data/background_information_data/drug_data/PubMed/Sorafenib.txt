Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor capable of facilitating apoptosis, mitigating angiogenesis and suppressing tumor cell proliferation. In late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), sorafenib is currently an effective first-line therapy. Unfortunately, the development of drug resistance to sorafenib is becoming increasingly common. This study aims to identify factors contributing to resistance and ways to mitigate resistance. Recent studies have shown that epigenetics, transport processes, regulated cell death, and the tumor microenvironment are involved in the development of sorafenib resistance in HCC and subsequent HCC progression. This study summarizes discoveries achieved recently in terms of the principles of sorafenib resistance and outlines approaches suitable for improving therapeutic outcomes for HCC patients.
In most cases, sorafenib-resistant HCC cells exhibit significant mesenchymal phenotype and stemness features. In this context, tumor cells might undergo cell fate transition in response to sorafenib or other targeted drugs in the presence or absence of genetic mutations. Therefore, understanding the major characteristics of drug-resistant cells state helps to discover new treatments that overcome drug resistance. To note, little is known about the metabolic or microenvironmental aspects of the certain tumor cell states beyond the genome. This review mainly focuses on the underlying mechanisms of acquired sorafenib resistance based on CSCs and EMT models, which explain tumor heterogeneity and have been considered the major cause of secondary sorafenib resistance. In particular, it discusses how the tumor microenvironment and tumor metabolism regulate cell stemness, mesenchymal state, and sorafenib resistance through epigenetic regulations, and provides reliable targets that might have synergetic effect with sorafenib.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Advanced HCC displays strong resistance to chemotherapy, and traditional chemotherapy drugs do not achieve satisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Sorafenib is an oral kinase inhibitor that inhibits tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis and induces cancer cell apoptosis. It also improves the survival rates of patients with advanced liver cancer. However, due to its poor solubility, fast metabolism, and low bioavailability, clinical applications of sorafenib have been substantially restricted. In recent years, various studies have been conducted on the use of nanoparticles to improve drug targeting and therapeutic efficacy in HCC. Moreover, nanoparticles have been extensively explored to improve the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib, and a variety of nanoparticles, such as polymer, lipid, silica, and metal nanoparticles, have been developed for treating liver cancer. All these new technologies have improved the targeted treatment of HCC by sorafenib and promoted nanomedicines as treatments for HCC. This review provides an overview of hot topics in tumor nanoscience and the latest status of treatments for HCC. It further introduces the current research status of nanoparticle drug delivery systems for treatment of HCC with sorafenib.
Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has an important antitumor effect as a ferroptosis inducer in multiple cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the status of sorafenib as a ferroptosis inducer has recently been questioned. There is very limited information about the relationship between ferroptosis and ATF2, and the role of ATF2 in sorafenib-induced ferroptosis has not been studied. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of ATF2 in sorafenib-induced ferroptosis in GC. We found that ATF2 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues and predicted a poor clinical prognosis. Silencing ATF2 significantly inhibited the malignant phenotype of GC cells. In addition, we observed that ATF2 was activated during sorafenib-induced ferroptosis in GC cells. ATF2 knockdown promoted sorafenib-induced ferroptosis, while ATF2 overexpression showed the opposite results in GC cells. Using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, we identified HSPH1 as a target of ATF2 and further validated it by ChIPâ€’qPCR analysis. HSPH1 can interact with SLC7A11 (cystine/glutamate transporter) and increase its protein stability. Importantly, knockdown of HSPH1 partly reversed the effects caused by ATF2 overexpression on sorafenib-induced ferroptosis in GC cells. In addition, the results from the tumor xenograft model showed that ATF2 knockdown can effectively enhance sorafenib sensitivity in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which sorafenib induces ferroptosis in GC.
Sorafenib is currently the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, sorafenib resistance remains a significant challenge. Aberrant AKT signaling activation is a crucial mechanism driving sorafenib resistance in HCC. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a vital role in antitumor immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant PCSK9 upregulation promotes cell proliferation and sorafenib resistance in HCC by inducing AKT-S473 phosphorylation. After palmitoylation at cysteine 600, the binding affinity between PCSK9 and tensin homolog (PTEN) is dramatically increased, inducing lysosome-mediated PTEN degradation and subsequent AKT activation. We identify zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 16 (ZDHHC16) as a palmitoyltransferase that promotes PCSK9 palmitoylation at cysteine 600. We also develop a biologically active PCSK9-derived peptide that competitively inhibits PCSK9 palmitoylation, suppressing AKT phosphorylation and augmenting the antitumor effects of sorafenib in HCC.
