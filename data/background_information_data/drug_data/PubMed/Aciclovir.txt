Primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the final 3 weeks of pregnancy may cause transplacental infection and neonatal varicella. Infants are most at risk of severe disease if born from 5 days before to 2 days after onset of the maternal varicella rash. Administration of post-exposure prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin and treatment of varicella with aciclovir for those at highest risk of progression to severe disease is advised. Universal vaccination against VZV significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal varicella.
Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, is most commonly caused by a viral infection (especially herpes simplex virus [HSV] type 1 in the UK) although autoimmune causes, such as N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis, are increasingly recognised. Most patients present with a change in consciousness level and may have fever, seizures, movement disorder or focal neurological deficits. Diagnosis hinges crucially on lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, but imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) may also be helpful. Treatment of HSV encephalitis with aciclovir dramatically improves outcome, but the optimal management of autoimmune encephalitis is still uncertain. Many patients with encephalitis are left with residual physical or neuropsychological deficits which require long-term multidisciplinary management. Here we review assessment of patients with suspected encephalitis, general aspects of management and areas of ongoing research.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis is a common cause of ocular morbidity. Resistance to aciclovir is probably under recognized. We describe three cases of aciclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus keratitis treated with systemic foscarnet and present a review of the pharmacological options available to manage this condition.
The paper concerns the new antiviral compound Valaciclovir--prodrug of Aciclovir, which is now in clinical studies. Antiviral activity, pharmacokinetic properties observed in animal studies, as well in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients are presented. Its clinical efficacy in herpes virus infection is also discussed.
While active against Herpesviridae, oral aciclovir is limited by low and inconsistent bioavailability. Modification of aciclovir by valine esterification, producing valaciclovir, results in significant increases in systemic aciclovir plasma levels. The exact mechanism of increased absorption with valaciclovir is not fully determined but probably involves intestinal dipeptide transporters, followed by rapid ester hydrolysis in the small intestine and liver. The enhanced pharmacokinetics of valaciclovir have translated into improvements in clinical efficacy and patient convenience.
