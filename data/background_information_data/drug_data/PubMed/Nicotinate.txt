Serum uric acid is determined by a balance between production and renal excretion. Luminal reabsorption of urate by the proximal tubule from the glomerular ultrafiltrate involves coupling between sodium-anion cotransport and urate-anion exchange. Apical sodium-coupled cotransport of lactate, ketoacids, nicotinate, and pyrazinoate increases intracellular levels of these anions in proximal tubular cells, stimulating the apical absorption of luminal urate via anion exchange. Hyperuricemia occurs when plasma levels of these anions increase; for example, hyperuricemia is a well-recognized concomitant of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. Relevant developments in the molecular and renal physiology of urate homeostasis are reviewed.
After 40 years of significant work, it was generally accepted that chromium in its trivalent valence state, Cr(III), is an essential micronutrient for humans. This view began to be challenged around the turn of the millennium. Some investigators argue that its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism reflect a pharmacological rather than a nutritional mode of action while yet others express concern about the toxicity and safety of supplemental chromium. Understanding the conjectures requires a reflection on the different definitions of "essential" and a perspective on the development of the field, which in itself is a remarkable snippet of science history and education. At the center of the discussion is our failure to have established a molecular structure and a specific site of action of a biological chromium complex. Instead, many different types of Cr(III) complexes, in particular chromium picolinate, but also those with nicotinate, propionate, histidinate, chloride, and other ligands, all with different chemical properties and biological activities, are being used in laboratory investigations and supplementation. Without knowledge of the metabolic transformations and the specific chemical properties that biological ligands impart on chromium, many of these investigations, in particular those ex vivo, have limited value for understanding chromium's biological function. Whether a chromium deficiency exists in humans and who is affected is poorly defined. There is evidence for the efficacy of chromium supplements in improving conditions in metabolic syndrome and in some diabetes Type 2 patients, but there are no effects on body composition in healthy individuals. Chromium is present in human tissues and in our food and Cr(III) compounds are given in (total) parenteral nutrition, taken as a supplement by athletes and bodybuilders, are ingredients of vitamin pills consumed by the general population, and are employed in animal nutrition. Another contentious issue is whether Cr(III) complexes are safe, as chromium in its hexavalent state, Cr(VI) (chromate), is genotoxic and a group I carcinogen for humans with sufficient evidence for inhalation and lung cancer. For the benefit of human health, there is a continuing need for a balanced view and informed and robust experiments to determine the specific biological molecules that are involved in the metabolism of Cr(III), the activity of biological Cr(III) complexes at specific sites of action, and the amount of supplemental Cr(III) that potentially causes long-term toxicity.
Mitochondrial dysfunction and low nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) levels are hallmarks of skeletal muscle ageing and sarcopenia(1-3), but it is unclear whether these defects result from local changes or can be mediated by systemic or dietary cues. Here we report a functional link between circulating levels of the natural alkaloid trigonelline, which is structurally related to nicotinic acid(4), NAD(+) levels and muscle health in multiple species. In humans, serum trigonelline levels are reduced with sarcopenia and correlate positively with muscle strength and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Using naturally occurring and isotopically labelled trigonelline, we demonstrate that trigonelline incorporates into the NAD(+) pool and increases NAD(+) levels in Caenorhabditis elegans, mice and primary myotubes from healthy individuals and individuals with sarcopenia. Mechanistically, trigonelline does not activate GPR109A but is metabolized via the nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase/Preiss-Handler pathway(5,6) across models. In C. elegans, trigonelline improves mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, reduces age-related muscle wasting and increases lifespan and mobility through an NAD(+)-dependent mechanism requiring sirtuin. Dietary trigonelline supplementation in male mice enhances muscle strength and prevents fatigue during ageing. Collectively, we identify nutritional supplementation of trigonelline as an NAD(+)-boosting strategy with therapeutic potential for age-associated muscle decline.
INTRODUCTION: Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasospasm of the peripheral arteries, causing pallor, followed by cyanosis and redness with pain, and sometimes paraesthesia. On rare occasions it can lead to ulceration of the fingers and toes (and in some cases of the ears or nose). This review focuses on primary (idiopathic) Raynaud's phenomenon, occurring in the absence of an underlying disease. The prevalence of primary Raynaud's phenomenon varies by sex, country, and exposure to workplace vibration. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for primary Raynaud's phenomenon? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amlodipine, diltiazem, exercise, inositol nicotinate, keeping warm, moxisylyte (thymoxamine), naftidrofuryl oxalate, nicardipine, nifedipine, prazosin, and smoking cessation.
Accumulating evidence has strengthened a link between dysbiotic gut microbiota and autism. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a promising therapy to repair dysbiotic gut microbiota. We previously performed intensive FMT called microbiota transfer therapy (MTT) for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and observed a substantial improvement of gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms. We also reported modulation of the gut microbiome toward a healthy one. In this study, we report comprehensive metabolite profiles from plasma and fecal samples of the children who participated in the MTT trial. With 619 plasma metabolites detected, we found that the autism group had distinctive metabolic profiles at baseline. Eight metabolites (nicotinamide riboside, IMP, iminodiacetate, methylsuccinate, galactonate, valylglycine, sarcosine, and leucylglycine) were significantly lower in the ASD group at baseline, while caprylate and heptanoate were significantly higher in the ASD group. MTT drove global shifts in plasma profiles across various metabolic features, including nicotinate/nicotinamide and purine metabolism. In contrast, for 669 fecal metabolites detected, when correcting for multiple hypotheses, no metabolite was significantly different at baseline. Although not statistically significant, p-cresol sulfate was relatively higher in the ASD group at baseline, and after MTT, the levels decreased and were similar to levels in typically developing (TD) controls. p-Cresol sulfate levels were inversely correlated with Desulfovibrio, suggesting a potential role of Desulfovibrio on p-cresol sulfate modulation. Further studies of metabolites in a larger ASD cohort, before and after MTT, are warranted, as well as clinical trials of other therapies to address the metabolic changes which MTT was not able to correct.IMPORTANCE Despite the prevalence of autism and its extensive impact on our society, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment is available for this complex neurobiological disorder. Based on mounting evidences that support a link between autism and the gut microbiome, we previously performed a pioneering open-label clinical trial using intensive fecal microbiota transplant. The therapy significantly improved gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms. Comprehensive metabolomic measurements in this study showed that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had different levels of many plasma metabolites at baseline compared to those in typically developing children. Microbiota transfer therapy (MTT) had a systemic effect, resulting in substantial changes in plasma metabolites, driving a number of metabolites to be more similar to those from typically developing children. Our results provide evidence that changes in metabolites are one mechanism of the gut-brain connection mediated by the gut microbiota and offer plausible clinical evidence for a promising autism treatment and biomarkers.
