BACKGROUND: Therapy options for OSA and central sleep apnea (CSA) are limited, thus many patients remain untreated. Clinically, acetazolamide is sometimes used for CSA; however, given overlapping pathophysiologic properties of OSA and CSA, we hypothesized that acetazolamide is equally effective for both types. Prior reviews focused on specific subtypes of sleep apnea, study designs, and languages, thus including few studies (typically </=3) limiting insights. RESEARCH QUESTION: How efficacious is acetazolamide for sleep apnea, and is its effect modified by sleep apnea type or acetazolamide dose? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We queried MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 11, 2019. Any study in which adults with OSA/CSA received oral acetazolamide vs no acetazolamide (control) that reported sleep apnea-related outcomes was eligible, independent of study design or language. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and abstracted data. Primary outcomes were apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation nadir. Quality of evidence (QoE) was rated with the use of Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods. RESULTS: We included 28 studies (13 OSA/15 CSA; N(Subjects,Acetazolamide) = 542; N(Subjects,Control) = 553) that enabled meta-analyses for 24 outcomes. Acetazolamide doses ranged from 36 to 1000 mg/d and treatment duration from 1 to 90 d (median, 6 d). Overall, acetazolamide vs control lowered the AHI by -0.7 effect sizes (95% CI, -0.83 to -0.58; I(2) = 0%; moderate QoE) that corresponded to a reduction of 37.7% (95% CI, -44.7 to -31.3) or 13.8/h (95% CI, -16.3 to -11.4; AHI(Control) = 36.5/h). The AHI reduction was similar in OSA vs CSA, but significantly greater with higher doses (at least up to 500 mg/d). Furthermore, acetazolamide improved oxygen saturation nadir by +4.4% (95% CI, 2.3 to 6.5; I(2) = 63%; no evidence of effect modification; very low QoE) and several secondary outcomes that included sleep quality measures and BP (mostly low QoE). INTERPRETATION: Short-term acetazolamide improved both OSA and CSA. Rigorous studies with long-term follow up are warranted to assess Acetazolamide's value for the chronic treatment of patients with sleep apnea. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (CRD42019147504).
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology that primarily affects obese women of childbearing age. Symptoms include disabling headaches, visual disturbances, and intracranial noises (pulsatile tinnitus). Currently, no standardized treatment guidelines are available and the current management focuses on weight loss and acetazolamide use. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that the initial use of topiramate may be considered in IIH treatment. Acetazolamide is the recommended initial treatment for IIH, with topiramate often used as a second-line agent. Topiramate has multiple benefits to indicate it would pose effective in IIH management. Through varying mechanisms, it leads to weight loss and improves migraine headache control, the most common headache phenotype in IIH. Topiramate also inhibits the carbonic anhydrase enzyme like acetazolamide to reduce intracranial pressure and treat papilledema. The safety profile of topiramate is comparable or superior to acetazolamide. To date, there are limited studies comparing topiramate to acetazolamide or other treatment modalities in IIH. Based on its varying mechanisms of action, topiramate is a strong potential treatment agent for IIH, yet acetazolamide is often chosen first-line. However, the data supporting use of acetazolamide or topiramate is inefficient to designate one agent preferred over the other. There is a need for further studies assessing topiramate use in the treatment of IIH, and comparing topiramate use to other treatment modalities.
Acetazolamide, a potent carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor, is the most commonly used and best-studied agent for the amelioration of acute mountain sickness (AMS). The actual mechanisms by which acetazolamide reduces symptoms of AMS, however, remain unclear. Traditionally, acetazolamide's efficacy has been attributed to inhibition of CA in the kidneys, resulting in bicarbonaturia and metabolic acidosis. The result is offsetting hyperventilation-induced respiratory alkalosis and allowance of chemoreceptors to respond more fully to hypoxic stimuli at altitude. Studies performed on both animals and humans, however, have shown that this explanation is unsatisfactory and that the efficacy of acetazolamide in the context of AMS is likely due to a multitude of effects. This review summarizes the known systemic effects of acetazolamide and incorporates them into a model encompassing several factors that are likely to play a key role in the drug's efficacy. Such factors include not only metabolic acidosis resulting from renal CA inhibition but also improvements in ventilation from tissue respiratory acidosis, improvements in sleep quality from carotid body CA inhibition, and effects of diuresis.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the ADVOR trial, acetazolamide improved decongestion in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Whether the beneficial effects of acetazolamide are consistent across the entire range of renal function remains unclear. METHODS: This is a pre-specified analysis of the ADVOR trial that randomized 519 patients with ADHF to intravenous acetazolamide or matching placebo on top of intravenous loop diuretics. The main endpoints of decongestion, diuresis, natriuresis, and clinical outcomes are assessed according to baseline renal function. Changes in renal function are evaluated between treatment arms. RESULTS: On admission, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 40 (30-52) mL/min/1.73 m(2). Acetazolamide consistently increased the likelihood of decongestion across the entire spectrum of eGFR (P-interaction = .977). Overall, natriuresis and diuresis were higher with acetazolamide, with a higher treatment effect for patients with low eGFR (both P-interaction < .007). Acetazolamide was associated with a higher incidence of worsening renal function (WRF; rise in creatinine >/= 0.3 mg/dL) during the treatment period (40.5% vs. 18.9%; P < .001), but there was no difference in creatinine after 3 months (P = .565). This was not associated with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalizations and mortality (P-interaction = .467). However, decongestion at discharge was associated with a lower incidence of adverse clinical outcomes irrespective of the onset of WRF (P-interaction = .805). CONCLUSIONS: Acetazolamide is associated with a higher rate of successful decongestion across the entire range of renal function with more pronounced effects regarding natriuresis and diuresis in patients with a lower eGFR. While WRF occurred more frequently with acetazolamide, this was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03505788.
Nephrocalcinosis has been reported in patients treated with acetazolamide and other agents, such as furosemide or bicarbonate. We present a case of nephrocalcinosis induced solely by acetazolamide and diagnosed radiographically. Possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are reviewed.
