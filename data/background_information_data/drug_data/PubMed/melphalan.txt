Cardiac deposition of misfolded light chains is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with immunoglobulin (AL) amyloidosis. Cardiac defibrillators can be used in the management of patients with advanced cardiac amyloidosis, but data concerning the use of these devices in patients undergoing treatment with high-dose melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) is limited. Herein we describe a single-institution experience of HDM/SCT in 15 patients with cardiac defibrillators. During the peri-transplant period, five of these patients (33%) had detectable cardiac arrhythmias and two patients (13%) had implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) discharges. Thirteen of the 14 evaluable patients (93%) achieved at least a partial hematologic response. Transplant-related mortality was 6.7% and median overall survival was 40.8 months, with multiple patients achieving an overall survival of >10 years. These data highlight the feasibility of HDM/SCT in patients with an ICD due to advanced cardiac AL amyloidosis, but highlight the need for additional research to appropriately determine which patients will benefit from this aggressive therapy.
Single-agent, high-dose melphalan continues to be the most commonly used conditioning regimen for transplantation-eligible patients with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. The timing of melphalan administration with respect to stem cell infusion has not been clearly defined. Many institutions require a minimum of 24 hours between melphalan administration and stem cell infusion; however, some institutions have adopted shorter intervals based on melphalan's short half-life. Some studies have suggested that shortening the interval between melphalan administration and stem cell infusion may contribute to delays in engraftment, but this correlation has not been clearly evaluated or defined. This multicenter retrospective cohort study evaluated the times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients who received stem cells at least 24 hours after melphalan (>/=24 hours cohort) compared with those who received stem cells within 24 hours of melphalan (<24 hours cohort. The study included a total of 723 adult patients, 502 patients in the >/=24 hours cohort and 221 in the <24 hours cohort, treated at 3 transplantation centers between January 1, 2016, and September 30, 2019. Patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. The Fisher exact test was used to compare nominal categorical variables between the 2 cohorts, and the nonparametric van der Waerden test or Mood median test was used to compare ordinal or continuous variables. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 12 days for both the >/=24 hours cohort (interquartile range [IQR], 11 to 12 days) and the <24 hours cohort (IQR, 11 to 13 days) (P = .07). The median time to platelet engraftment was 19 days for both the >/=24 hours cohort (IQR, 17 to 22 days) and <24 hours cohort (IQR, 17 to 20 days) (P = .25). The median time between melphalan administration and stem cell infusion in the <24 hours cohort was 18 hours, with a minimum time of 12 hours. The existing literature has not clearly defined the impact of the timing between melphalan administration and stem cell infusion on engraftment in autologous transplantation. The ability to safely shorten the interval between chemotherapy and transplantation could increase logistical flexibility and/or decrease the length of hospital stay. This large multicenter retrospective study did not identify a statistical or clinical impact on engraftment when melphalan was infused <24 hours or >/=24 hours before autologous stem cell infusion.
Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death in women. Dietary bioactive compounds may act at different stages of carcinogenesis, including tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. Spices have been used for thousands of years and have many bioactive compounds with chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties. Curcumin has a multitude of beneficial biological properties, including anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. This study investigated the effects of cotreatment with curcumin and the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan in cultured MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. When used alone, both curcumin and melphalan had a cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cells. Combined treatment with 11.65 microM of curcumin and 93.95 microM of melphalan (CURC/MEL) reduced cell viability by 28.64% and 72.43% after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. CURC/MEL reduced the number of colony-forming units and increased ROS levels by 1.36-fold. CURC/MEL alter cell cycle progression, induce apoptosis, and upregulate caspases-3, -7, and -9, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cotreatment with curcumin and melphalan have anti-breast cancer cells effects and represent a promising candidate for clinical testing.
We conducted a randomised phase II study to determine the optimal dose and schedule of melphalan, prednisone, and bortezomib (MPB) (jRCTs031180097). Transplant-ineligible untreated multiple myeloma patients were randomised to Arm A (twice weekly bortezomib in one six-week cycle followed by eight five-week cycles of four times once weekly bortezomib with melphalan and prednisolone on days 1-4) or Arm B (nine four-week cycles of three times once weekly bortezomib with melphalan and prednisolone on days 1-4). The primary end-point was complete response (CR) rate. Of 91 patients randomised to two arms, 88 were eligible. The median cumulative bortezomib doses were 45.8 and 35.1 mg/m(2) , CR rate was 18.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4-33.4] and 6.7% (95% CI 1.4-18.3), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 and 1.4 years in Arms A and B [hazard ratio (HR) 1.93 (95% CI 1.09-3.42)], respectively. Frequent grade >/=3 haematologic toxicities in Arms A and B were neutropenia (64.4% vs. 28.3%) and thrombocytopenia (35.6% vs. 10.9%). Grade 2/3 peripheral neuropathy was observed in 24.4/2.2% in Arm A and 8.7/0% in Arm B. In conclusion, Arm A was the more promising regimen, suggesting that the twice weekly schedule of bortezomib in the first cycle and higher cumulative dose of both bortezomib and melphalan influences the efficacy of modified MPB.
The reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, fludarabine and melphalan, is frequently used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Melphalan and the active metabolite of fludarabine, F-ara-A, are excreted via the kidneys. Existing methods to assess clearance in this setting are based on serum creatinine, which has known limitations for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation in patients with malignancy. Measured GFR (mGFR) may better predict drug dosing to mitigate toxicity and increase the chances of successful engraftment. The primary objective of this study was to assess the association between mGFR and risk for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT receiving conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan. In the 109 included patients, mGFR <65 mL/min/1.73 m2 predicted a significantly higher rate of overall NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.35; P = 04) and 1-year incidence of infection (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.54-4.55; P < .001) in addition to a significantly lower 2-year survival (P = .019). Kidney function estimated via estimated GFR (eGFR) and estimated creatinine clearance did not correlate with posttransplant outcomes. These results suggest that mGFR is a promising approach for assessing clearance in patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT and may be preferred to standard creatinine-based eGFR strategies.
A series of spin-labeled melphalan and chlorambucil derivatives, coupling the alkylating agents with 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) radicals, were synthesized, characterized, and their biological properties in vitro were evaluated. These compounds showed much higher cytotoxic activity against human leukemia cell line K562 in vitro than their parent compounds.
The combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide (MPT) is considered standard therapy for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation. Long-term treatment with thalidomide is hampered by neurotoxicity. Melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide, followed by lenalidomide maintenance therapy, showed promising results without severe neuropathy emerging. We randomly assigned 668 patients between nine 4-week cycles of MPT followed by thalidomide maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (MPT-T) and the same MP regimen with thalidomide being replaced by lenalidomide (MPR-R). This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial was undertaken by Dutch-Belgium Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology and the Nordic Myeloma Study Group (the HOVON87/NMSG18 trial). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 318 patients were randomly assigned to receive MPT-T, and 319 received MPR-R. After a median follow-up of 36 months, PFS with MPT-T was 20 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 18-23 months) vs 23 months (95% CI, 19-27 months) with MPR-R (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72-1.04; P = .12). Response rates were similar, with at least a very good partial response of 47% and 45%, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was more pronounced with MPR-R, especially grades 3 and 4 neutropenia: 64% vs 27%. Neuropathy of at least grade 3 was significantly higher in the MPT-T arm: 16% vs 2% in MPR-R, resulting in a significant shorter duration of maintenance therapy (5 vs 17 months in MPR-R), irrespective of age. MPR-R has no advantage over MPT-T concerning efficacy. The toxicity profile differed with clinically significant neuropathy during thalidomide maintenance vs myelosuppression with MPR.
Alteration of the melphalan molecule by shifting the di(2-choroethyl)aminogroup from the para- to the meta-position of the phenylalanine residue results in m-L-sarcolysin. By covalent conjugation of different amino acids at the amino- and carboxylgroups of this molecule, a mixture of six peptides known as Peptichemio has been synthesized. In a previous investigation we found that Peptichemio was less toxic to human lymphoblasts than m-L-sarcolysin. In contrast, in the present investigation we found that Peptichemio has higher cytotoxic effect than m-L-sarcolysin on two human melanoma cell lines. The higher cytotoxicity was paralleled by a higher induction of DNA cross-links by Peptichemio as compared to m-L-sarcolysin. A comparative analysis of the six peptides on Peptichemio showed differences in cytotoxic effects on a melanoma cell line. One of the six peptides displayed a considerably higher cytotoxicity than peptichemio itself.
BACKGROUND: In the phase 3 ALCYONE study, daratumumab plus bortezomib/melphalan/prednisone (D-VMP) versus bortezomib/melphalan/prednisone (VMP) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in transplant-ineligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. We present a subgroup analysis of ALCYONE by patient frailty status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Frailty assessment was performed retrospectively using age, Charlson comorbidity index, and baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score. Patients were classified as fit (0), intermediate (1), or frail (>/=2); a nonfrail category combined fit and intermediate patients. RESULTS: Among randomized patients (D-VMP, n = 350; VMP, n = 356), 391 (55.4%) were nonfrail (D-VMP, 187 [53.4%]; VMP, 204 [57.3%]) and 315 (44.6%) were frail (163 [46.6%]; 152 [42.7%]). After 40.1-months median follow-up, nonfrail patients had longer PFS and OS than frail patients, but benefits of D-VMP versus VMP were maintained across subgroups: PFS nonfrail (median, 45.7 vs. 19.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; P < .0001), frail (32.9 vs. 19.5 months; HR, 0.51; P < .0001); OS nonfrail (36-month rate, 83.6% vs. 74.5%), frail (71.4% vs. 59.0%). Improved greater than or equal to complete response and minimal residual disease (10(-)(5))-negativity rates were observed for D-VMP versus VMP across subgroups. The 2 most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (nonfrail: 39.2% [D-VMP] and 42.4% [VMP]; frail: 41.3% and 34.4%) and thrombocytopenia (nonfrail: 32.8% and 36.9%; frail: 36.9% and 39.1%). CONCLUSION: Our findings support the clinical benefit of D-VMP in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients enrolled in ALCYONE, regardless of frailty status.
High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard of care for selected patients with refractory/relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and it is also used as first-line clinical consolidation option for some aggressive NHL subtypes. Conditioning regimen prior to ASCT is one of the essential factors related with clinical outcomes post transplant. The conditioning regimen of carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM) traditionally is considered the standard of care for patients with lymphoma who are eligible for transplantation. Replacement of carmustine with bendamustine (BeEAM) was described as an alternative conditioning regimen in the autograft setting for patients with lymphoma. Several studies have reported inconsistent clinical outcomes comparing BeEAM and BEAM. Therefore, in the lack of well-designed prospective comparative studies, the comparison of BeEAM versus BEAM is based on retrospective trials. To compare the clinical outcomes between BeEAM and BEAM, we performed a meta-analysis of 10 studies which compared the outcomes between BeEAM and BEAM in patients autografted for lymphoma disease (HL or NHL). We searched article titles and compared transplantation with BeEAM versus BEAM in MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane library, and EMBASE database. Here, we report the results of nine main endpoints in our meta-analysis comparing BeEAM and BEAM, including neutrophil engraftment (NE), platelet engraftment (PE), overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse rate (RR), grade 3 mucositis, renal toxicity, and cardiotoxicity. We discovered that the BeEAM regimen was associated with a slightly better PFS [pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.94, P = 0.02], lower RR (0.49, 95% CI, 0.31-0.76, P = 0.002), higher mucositis (3.43, 95% CI, 2.29-5.16, P = 0.001), renal toxicity (4.49, 95% CI, 2.68-7.51, P = 0.001), and cardiotoxicity (1.88, 95% CI, 1.03-3.40, P = 0.03). We also discovered that the two groups had equivalent NE (pooled WMD -0.64, 95% CI, -1.46 to 0.18, P = 0.13), PE (pooled WMD -0.3, 95% CI, -1.68 to 2.28, P = 0.77), OS (0.73, 95% CI, 0.52-1.01, P = 0.07), and NRM (1.51, 95% CI, 0.76-2.98, P = 0.24). The results of this meta-analysis show that the BeEAM regimen is a viable alternative to BEAM. More prospective comparisons between BeEAM and BEAM are required.
IMPORTANCE: Demonstrating the usefulness and complications of multiagent intravitreal chemotherapy is necessary for successful treatment in patients with recalcitrant vitreous seeding of retinoblastoma. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and complications of combined intravitreal chemotherapy (melphalan hydrochloride and topotecan hydrochloride) for viable vitreous seeding from retinoblastoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study was conducted in a hospital setting. Trans-pars plana intravitreal injection of melphalan hydrochloride (40 microg in 0.04 mL of diluent) combined with topotecan hydrochloride (8-20 microg in 0.04 mL of balanced salt solution) was performed in 9 eyes, followed by injection site cryotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complete regression of vitreous seeds of retinoblastoma. RESULTS: Nine eyes, initially classified as group D (n = 6) or E (n = 3) according to International Classification of Retinoblastoma categorization, received a standard 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy and/or intra-arterial chemotherapy and subsequently developed recurrent viable vitreous seeds. Intravitreal administration of melphalan combined with topotecan produced complete control of vitreous seeds in all 9 eyes following a mean of 1.9 injections (median, 2; range, 1-3 injections). In 3 cases (33%), tumor control was achieved with a single injection, whereas in 6 (67%) cases, 2 or 3 injections were necessary. Three patients (33%) subsequently underwent enucleation because of recurrent tumor and persistent anterior chamber lesions. During a mean 15.2 months of follow-up (median, 16; range, 7-25 months), there was no recurrence of new tumor or vitreous seeds in the remaining 6 eyes. Complications included temporary hypotonia of 2 weeks or less (2 [22%]), temporary epithelial defect (1 [11%]), and vitreous hemorrhage (1 [11%]). There was no case of episcleral or orbital retinoblastoma extension or remote retinoblastoma metastasis. There was no change in the a and b waves of bright-flash electroretinograms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Administration of combined intravitreal melphalan and topotecan in eyes not subsequently enucleated appears to be safe and effective for resistant or recurrent vitreous seeds from retinoblastoma. In 3 of the cases (33%), tumor control was achieved with a single injection.
The reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, fludarabine and melphalan 140 mg/m(2) (FM140), is widely adopted in practice. Pharmacokinetic studies report 10-fold interpatient variability in melphalan exposure. We identified low hemoglobin (Hb) and/or creatinine clearance (CrCl), determinants of melphalan pharmacokinetic, as strong predictors of outcomes after high-dose melphalan and autologous transplant. We hypothesized that these variables could predict for outcomes after FM140. Overall survival was shorter in patients with a lower Hb (113 vs. 2536 days; p = 0.004), due to an increased rate of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (p = 0.0005). Overall survival was also worse in patients with lower CrCl (75 vs. 317 days; p = 0.003), with a significantly worse nonrelapse mortality (p = 0.0023). In a multivariate analysis, a higher Hb and CrCl predicted for better overall survival (p = 0.017). In patients with a lower Hb, the median duration of hospitalization (p = 0.02) and the mean duration of diarrhea (p = 0.008) were longer. In patients with a lower CrCl, the median duration of hospitalization (p = 0.06) and the mean duration of diarrhea (p = 0.0009) longer, and the rate of infection was higher (p = 0.02). We show for the first time that Hb and CrCl represent important determinants of outcomes after FM140, suggesting that pharmacokinetic-directed dosing may be beneficial in achieving optimal outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a pivotal treatment for lymphoma patients. The BeEAM regimen (Bendamustine, Etoposide, Cytarabine, Melphalan) traditionally relies on cryopreservation, whereas the CEM regimen (Carboplatin, Etoposide, Melphalan) has been optimized for short-duration administration without the need for cryopreservation. This study rigorously compares the clinical and safety profiles of the BeEAM and CEM regimens. METHODS: A controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted with 58 lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT at the International Medical Center (IMC) in Cairo, Egypt. Patients were randomly assigned to either the BeEAM (n = 29) or CEM (n = 29) regimen, with an 18-month follow-up period. Clinical and safety outcomes were meticulously compared, focusing on time to engraftment for neutrophils and platelets, side effects, length of hospitalization, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and survival rates. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate a significant advantage for the CEM regimen. Neutrophil recovery was markedly faster in the CEM group, averaging 8.5 days compared to 14.5 days in the BeEAM group (p < 0.0001). Platelet recovery was similarly expedited, with 11 days in the CEM group versus 23 days in the BeEAM group (p < 0.0001). Hospitalization duration was substantially shorter for CEM patients, averaging 18.5 days compared to 30 days for those on BeEAM (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in the CEM group at 96.55% (95% CI: 84.91-99.44%) compared to 79.31% (95% CI: 63.11-89.75%) in the BeEAM group (p = 0.049). Progression-free survival (PFS) was also notably superior in the CEM group, at 86.21% (95% CI: 86.14-86.28%) versus 62.07% (95% CI: 61.94-62.20%) in the BeEAM group (p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: The CEM regimen might demonstrate superiority over the BeEAM regimen, with faster neutrophil and platelet recovery, reduced hospitalization time, and significantly improved overall and progression-free survival rates. Future studies with longer duration and larger sample sizes are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the registration number NCT05813132 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05813132 ). (The first submitted registration date: is March 16, 2023).
Melphalan is associated with severe side effects such as mucositis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression. We investigated how much the individual severity of these side effects is predicted by pharmacokinetics. In addition, we studied glutathione S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms in relation to adverse events. A high interindividual pharmacokinetic variability was observed in 84 patients. There was a linear correlation between creatinine and melphalan clearance (P=0.0004). Patients treated with a dose > or = 70 mg/m(2) had a 23-fold increased risk to develop mucositis (P<0.001) and a 12-fold increased risk to develop diarrhea (P<0.001) compared with lower doses. The GSTP1 codon 105 polymorphism may be relevant for development of mucositis and the GSTT1 deletion may predict diarrhea, but these findings require confirmation. Melphalan-induced side effects were significantly dependent only on dose. Therapeutic drug monitoring or genotyping for GST does not appear to be very helpful in optimizing therapy with melphalan.
