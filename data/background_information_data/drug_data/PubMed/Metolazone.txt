BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To examine the decongestive effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin compared to the thiazide-like diuretic metolazone in patients hospitalized for heart failure and resistant to treatment with intravenous furosemide. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multi-centre, open-label, randomized, and active-comparator trial. Patients were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or metolazone 5-10 mg once daily for a 3-day treatment period, with follow-up for primary and secondary endpoints until day 5 (96 h). The primary endpoint was a diuretic effect, assessed by change in weight (kg). Secondary endpoints included a change in pulmonary congestion (lung ultrasound), loop diuretic efficiency (weight change per 40 mg of furosemide), and a volume assessment score. 61 patients were randomized. The mean (+/-standard deviation) cumulative dose of furosemide at 96 h was 977 (+/-492) mg in the dapagliflozin group and 704 (+/-428) mg in patients assigned to metolazone. The mean (+/-standard deviation) decrease in weight at 96 h was 3.0 (2.5) kg with dapagliflozin compared to 3.6 (2.0) kg with metolazone [mean difference 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12,1.41 kg; P = 0.11]. Loop diuretic efficiency was less with dapagliflozin than with metolazone [mean 0.15 (0.12) vs. 0.25 (0.19); difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.17,0.01 kg; P = 0.10]. Changes in pulmonary congestion and volume assessment score were similar between treatments. Decreases in plasma sodium and potassium and increases in urea and creatinine were smaller with dapagliflozin than with metolazone. Serious adverse events were similar between treatments. CONCLUSION: In patients with heart failure and loop diuretic resistance, dapagliflozin was not more effective at relieving congestion than metolazone. Patients assigned to dapagliflozin received a larger cumulative dose of furosemide but experienced less biochemical upset than those assigned to metolazone.

OBJECTIVES: This study compared combination diuretic strategies in acute heart failure (AHF) complicated by diuretic resistance (DR). BACKGROUND: Combination diuretic regimens to overcome loop DR are commonly used but with limited evidence. METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blinded trial in 60 patients hospitalized with AHF and intravenous (IV) loop DR. Patients were randomized to oral metolazone, IV chlorothiazide, or tolvaptan therapy. All patients received concomitant high-dose IV infusions of furosemide. The primary outcome was 48-h weight loss. RESULTS: The cohort exhibited DR prior to enrollment, producing 1,188 +/- 476 ml of urine in 12 h during high-dose loop diuretic therapy (IV furosemide: 612 +/- 439 mg/day). All 3 interventions significantly improved diuretic efficacy (p < 0.001). Compared to metolazone (4.6 +/- 2.7 kg), neither IV chlorothiazide (5.8 +/- 2.7 kg; 1.2 kg [95% confidence interval (CI)]: -2.9 to 0.6; p = 0.292) nor tolvaptan (4.1 +/- 3.3 kg; 0.5 kg [95% CI: -1.5 to 2.4; p = 0.456) resulted in more weight loss at 48 h. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) cumulative urine output increased significantly and did not differ among those receiving metolazone (7.78 [IQR: 6.59 to 10.10] l) and chlorothiazide (8.77 [IQR: 7.37 to 10.86] l; p = 0.245) or tolvaptan (9.70 [IQR: 6.36 to 13.81] l; p = 0.160). Serum sodium decreased less with tolvaptan than with metolazone (+4 +/- 5 vs. -1 +/- 3 mEq/l; p = 0.001), but 48-h spot urine sodium was lower with tolvaptan (58 +/- 25 mmol/l) than with metolazone (104 +/- 16 mmol/l; p = 0.002) and with chlorothiazide (117 +/- 14 mmol/l; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this moderately sized DR trial, weight loss was excellent with the addition of metolazone, IV chlorothiazide, or tolvaptan to loop diuretics, without a detectable between-group difference.

Widely prevalent in the general population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently complicated with hypertension. Control of hypertension in this high-risk population is a major modifiable cardiovascular and renal risk factor but often requires multiple medications. Although thiazides are an attractive agent, guidelines have previously recommended against thiazide use in stage 4 CKD. We review the updated guidelines on thiazide use in advanced CKD, the antihypertensive mechanism of thiazides, and the clinical studies of thiazides in CKD. Older uncontrolled studies have shown that metolazone reduces blood pressure in CKD, but more recently small randomized controlled trials of hydrochlorothiazide in CKD have shown significant improvement in mean arterial pressure of 15 mmHg. Two recent uncontrolled studies of chlorthalidone including one that used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring found significant improvements in blood pressure. These findings all suggest that thiazides may be efficacious even in advanced CKD; however, electrolyte abnormalities were common in the studies reviewed so close monitoring is necessary during use. Adequately powered randomized trials are now needed before the routine use of thiazide diuretics in advanced CKD can be recommended.
BACKGROUND: Limited evidence exists regarding efficacy and safety of diuretic regimens in ambulatory, congestion-refractory, chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to compare the potency and safety of commonly used diuretic regimens in CHF patients. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, open-label, crossover study conducted in NYHA functional class II to IV CHF patients, treated in an ambulatory day-care unit. Each patient received 3 different diuretic regimens: intravenous (IV) furosemide 250 mg; IV furosemide 250 mg plus oral metolazone 5 mg; and IV furosemide 250 mg plus IV acetazolamide 500 mg. Treatments were administered once a week, in 1 of 6 randomized sequences. The primary endpoint was total sodium excretion, and the secondary was total urinary volume excreted, both measured for 6 hours post-treatment initiation. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were recruited. Administration of furosemide plus metolazone resulted in the highest weight of sodium excreted, 4,691 mg (95% CI: 4,153-5,229 mg) compared with furosemide alone, 3,835 mg (95% CI: 3,279-4,392 mg; P = 0.015) and to furosemide plus acetazolamide 3,584 mg (95% CI: 3,020-4,148 mg; P = 0.001). Furosemide plus metolazone resulted in 1.84 L of urine (95% CI: 1.63-2.05 L), compared with 1.58 L (95% CI: 1.37-1.8); P = 0.039 collected following administration of furosemide plus acetazolamide and 1.71 L (95% CI: 1.49-1.93 L) following furosemide alone. The incidence of worsening renal function was significantly higher when adding metolazone (39%) to furosemide compared with furosemide alone (16%) and to furosemide plus acetazolamide (2.6%) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory CHF patients, furosemide plus metolazone resulted in a significantly higher natriuresis compared with IV furosemide alone or furosemide plus acetazolamide.
A 62-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease stage 4, sleep apnoea on continuous positive airway pressure and recent admission for acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure presented to emergency room with weakness. She was hypotensive and had symptomatic bradycardia in the 30 s secondary to hyperkalaemia and beta-blockers, raising concern for BRASH syndrome. Antihypertensives were immediately held. Potassium-lowering agents (with calcium gluconate for cardiac stability) were begun, as were fluids and dopamine for vasopressor support. The patient was admitted to intensive care unit and electrophysiology was consulted. Over the next 2 days, the patient clinically improved: she remained off dopamine for over 24 hours; potassium levels and renal function improved; and heart rate stabilised in 60 s. The patient was eventually discharged and advised to avoid metolazone, bumetanide and carvedilol, with primary care provider and cardiology follow-up.
