Although the pathogenesis of migraine is not fully understood, accumulating evidence indicates migraine may be driven by impaired brain energy metabolism in the context of pathologically high levels of adenosine. Considerable evidence indicates that aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, can provide strong therapeutic relief in pain, particularly post-dural headache. Moreover, direct observations from a previously published observational case series have demonstrated a strong therapeutic impact of low-dose aminophylline in patients with severe, unremitting migraine attacks. Although higher doses of aminophylline are associated with an unfavourable adverse effect profile, low doses of aminophylline are associated with minimal adverse effects. Despite this promise, double-blinded randomized trials will be needed to determine the true therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aminophylline in migraine.
BACKGROUND: Methylxanthine, including caffeine citrate and aminophylline, is the most common pharmacologic treatment for apnea of prematurity. However, due to the lack of high-quality evidence, there are no clear recommendations or guidelines on how to choose between caffeine and aminophylline. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of caffeine and aminophylline for apnea of prematurity, and provide reliable evidence for clinical medication in the treatment for apnea of prematurity. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from May 1975 to June 2022. RESULTS: Ten studies including a total of 923 preterm infants were evaluated. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in the effective rate of 1-3days between caffeine and aminophylline (OR 1.05, 95%CI: 0.40-2.74, P = 0.914). However, for side effects such as tachycardia (OR 0.22, 95%CI: 0.13-0.37, P<0.001) and feeding intolerance (OR 0.40, 95%CI: 0.23-0.70, P = 0.001), the incidence rate was lower in the caffeine group compared with the aminophylline group. No significant difference was found in hyperglycemia (OR 0.45, 95%CI: 0.19-1.05, P = 0.064). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis reveals that caffeine citrate and aminophylline have similar therapeutic effectiveness on respiratory function, but caffeine has fewer side effects and should be considered first for treatment.
INTRODUCTION: Second-line drugs for acute asthma, such as salbutamol, magnesium sulfate, and aminophylline, are generally intravenously administered. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of using mag nesium sulfate or aminophylline in children who did not respond to initial treatment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Randomized clinical trial. Children who did not improve the Modified Pulmonary Index Score (mPSI) receive at random magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg/single dose) or aminophylline (5 mg/ kg/dose followed by continuous infusion at 1 mg/kg/hour for 3 hours). Primary endpoints were changes in mPSI and oxygen saturation; secondary endpoints: hospitalization rate, need for transfer to the intensive care unit, use of a third intervention, and adverse effects. RESULTS: 131 patients were studied (66 patients in the aminophylline group and 65 MgSO4). The mean age was 5 +/- 2.3 years, the demographic and clinical parameters did not differ between the groups. In the group that received magnesium sulfate, the mPSI and oxygen saturation changed significantly in favor from 13.1 +/- 1.3 to 4.9 +/- 2.5 (p < 0.001) and from 3.3 +/- 2.5; (p 0.021), respectively, and their risk of hospital admission (RR 0.68 95% CI [0.56, 0.82]) and of secondary failure (0.16 95% CI 95% [0 , 07; 0.38]) decreased. Only one adverse event (tachycardia) was recorded. CONCLUSION: The administration of a single dose of magnesium sulfate proved to be more effective and safe than the use of aminophylline as a second- line drug.
Although aminophylline/theophylline has been relegated to third- and fourth-line status in the cardiopulmonary armamentarium, its use in specific pathophysiologic states, especially those of cardiac etiology, can be of significant benefit. The consulting clinician should maintain an awareness of its potential as adjunctive therapy in cases of atrioventricular block, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias in particular. It should not yet be shelved as an archaic agent.
Aminophylline therapy has undergone change in the past decade. With the changes in usage and dosage forms, the frequency of toxicity in the pediatric population, especially in adolescents, has increased dramatically. Two distinct patterns, chronic and acute, have been recognized and treatment methods for both are changing. Table 4 summarizes the emerging state-of-the-art therapy for aminophylline toxicity. Judging from the activity seen in the literature, investigation into aminophylline toxicity will continue to be a priority. We will see a greater understanding of the disease process and a refining of the therapeutic process. The ultimate goal is the elimination of mortality and the minimization of morbidity from aminophylline toxicity.
