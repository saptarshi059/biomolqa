Status epilepticus (SE) is a common medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Management that follows published guidelines is best suited to improve outcomes, with the most severe cases frequently being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Diagnosis of convulsive SE can be made without electroencephalography (EEG), but EEG is required to reliably diagnose nonconvulsive SE. Rapidly narrowing down underlying causes for SE is crucial, as this may guide additional management steps. Causes may range from underlying epilepsy to acute brain injuries such as trauma, cardiac arrest, stroke, and infections. Initial management consists of rapid administration of benzodiazepines and one of the following non-sedating intravenous antiseizure medications (ASM): (fos-)phenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate; other ASM are increasingly used, such as lacosamide or brivaracetam. SE that continues despite these medications is called refractory, and most commonly treated with continuous infusions of midazolam or propofol. Alternatives include further non-sedating ASM and non-pharmacologic approaches. SE that reemerges after weaning or continues despite management with propofol or midazolam is labeled super-refractory SE. At this step, management may include non-sedating or sedating compounds including ketamine and barbiturates. Continuous video EEG is necessary for the management of refractory and super-refractory SE, as these are almost always nonconvulsive. If possible, management of the underlying cause of seizures is crucial particularly for patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Short-term mortality ranges from 10 to 15% after SE and is primarily related to increasing age, underlying etiology, and medical comorbidities. Refractoriness of treatment is clearly related to outcome with mortality rising from 10% in responsive cases, to 25% in refractory, and nearly 40% in super-refractory SE.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurologic emergency affecting about 36.1/100 000 person-years that frequently requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. There have been advances in our understanding of epidemiology, pathophysiology, and EEG monitoring of SE, and there have been large-scale treatment trials, discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent changes in the definitions of SE have helped guide management protocols and we have much better predictors of outcome. Observational studies have confirmed the efficacy of benzodiazepines and large treatment trials indicate that all routinely used second line treatments (i.e., levetiracetam, valproate and fosphenytoin) are equally effective. Better understanding of the pathophysiology has indicated that nonanti-seizure medications aimed at underlying pathological processes should perhaps be considered in the treatment of SE; already immunosuppressant treatments are being more widely used in particular for new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) and Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) that sometimes revealed autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis. Growing evidence for ICU EEG monitoring and major advances in automated analysis of the EEG could help intensivist to assess the control of electrographic seizures. SUMMARY: Research into the morbi-mortality of SE has highlighted the potential devastating effects of this condition, emphasizing the need for rapid and aggressive treatment, with particular attention to cardiorespiratory and neurological complications. Although we now have a good evidence-base for the initial status epilepticus management, the best treatments for the later stages are still unclear and clinical trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies are long overdue.
BACKGROUND: The choice of drugs for patients with status epilepticus that is refractory to treatment with benzodiazepines has not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: In a randomized, blinded, adaptive trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of three intravenous anticonvulsive agents - levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate - in children and adults with convulsive status epilepticus that was unresponsive to treatment with benzodiazepines. The primary outcome was absence of clinically evident seizures and improvement in the level of consciousness by 60 minutes after the start of drug infusion, without additional anticonvulsant medication. The posterior probabilities that each drug was the most or least effective were calculated. Safety outcomes included life-threatening hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia, endotracheal intubation, seizure recurrence, and death. RESULTS: A total of 384 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive levetiracetam (145 patients), fosphenytoin (118), or valproate (121). Reenrollment of patients with a second episode of status epilepticus accounted for 16 additional instances of randomization. In accordance with a prespecified stopping rule for futility of finding one drug to be superior or inferior, a planned interim analysis led to the trial being stopped. Of the enrolled patients, 10% were determined to have had psychogenic seizures. The primary outcome of cessation of status epilepticus and improvement in the level of consciousness at 60 minutes occurred in 68 patients assigned to levetiracetam (47%; 95% credible interval, 39 to 55), 53 patients assigned to fosphenytoin (45%; 95% credible interval, 36 to 54), and 56 patients assigned to valproate (46%; 95% credible interval, 38 to 55). The posterior probability that each drug was the most effective was 0.41, 0.24, and 0.35, respectively. Numerically more episodes of hypotension and intubation occurred in the fosphenytoin group and more deaths occurred in the levetiracetam group than in the other groups, but these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of benzodiazepine-refractory convulsive status epilepticus, the anticonvulsant drugs levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate each led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 60 minutes in approximately half the patients, and the three drugs were associated with similar incidences of adverse events.

The concept of neuroprotection relies on the principle that delayed neuronal injury occurs after ischemia. The phenomenon of the "ischemic cascade" has been described, and each step along this cascade provides a target for therapeutic intervention. In animal models of global and focal cerebral ischemia, numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated various agents to be neuroprotective at different steps along this cascade. A wide variety of drugs has also been studied in humans. Ten classes of neuroprotective agents have reached phase III efficacy trials but have shown mixed results. They include calcium channel antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, lubeluzole, CDP-choline, the free radical scavenger tirilizad, anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibody, GM-1 ganglioside, clomethiazole, the sodium channel antagonist fosphenytoin, and piracetam. In the future, clinicians may have an armamentarium of treatments for acute ischemic stroke at their disposal, with a combination of agents directed at different sites in the ischemic cascade being the ultimate goal.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an extremely painful condition which can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In Europe, TN patients are managed by many different specialities. Therefore, there is a great need for comprehensive European guidelines for the management of TN. The European Academy of Neurology asked an expert panel to develop recommendations for a series of questions that are essential for daily clinical management of patients with TN. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed and recommendations was developed based on GRADE, where feasible; if not, a good practice statement was given. RESULTS: The use of the most recent classification system is recommended, which diagnoses TN as primary TN, either classical or idiopathic depending on the degree of neurovascular contact, or as secondary TN caused by pathology other than neurovascular contact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a combination of three high-resolution sequences, should be performed as part of the work-up in TN patients, because no clinical characteristics can exclude secondary TN. If MRI is not possible, trigeminal reflexes can be used. Neurovascular contact plays an important role in primary TN, but demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of TN. Rather, it may help to decide if and when a patient should be referred for microvascular decompression. In acute exacerbations of pain, intravenous infusion of fosphenytoin or lidocaine can be used. For long-term treatment, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are recommended as drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, botulinum toxin type A, pregabalin, baclofen and phenytoin may be used either alone or as add-on therapy. It is recommended that patients should be offered surgery if pain is not sufficiently controlled medically or if medical treatment is poorly tolerated. Microvascular decompression is recommended as first-line surgery in patients with classical TN. No recommendation can be given for choice between any neuroablative treatments or between them and microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic TN. Neuroablative treatments should be the preferred choice if MRI does not demonstrate any neurovascular contact. Treatment for patients with secondary TN should in general follow the same principles as for primary TN. In addition to medical and surgical management, it is recommended that patients are offered psychological and nursing support. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous TN guidelines, there are important changes regarding diagnosis and imaging. These allow better characterization of patients and help in decision making regarding the planning of medical and surgical management. Recommendations on pharmacological and surgical management have been updated. There is a great need for future research on all aspects of TN, including pathophysiology and management.
