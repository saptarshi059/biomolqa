Sweet's syndrome is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Drug-induced Sweet's syndrome typically occurs soon after drug administration, with rapid resolution of symptoms with cessation of the offending agent. We report a man in his early 40s who presented with fever and widespread erythematous rash on a background of recently diagnosed mild stricturing ileal Crohn's disease. He was commenced on 6-mercaptopurine 12 days before presentation. Skin biopsy demonstrated diffuse infiltration of neutrophils in the upper dermis, dermal oedema, eosinophils and fibrin deposition. Symptoms rapidly improved with cessation of 6-mercaptopurine without requiring systemic corticosteroids.
Azathioprine is a synthetic purine analog derived from 6-mercaptopurine. It is a purine antagonist and its active metabolites act by disrupting the function of endogenous purines. It has a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive mechanism of action. It is used in dermatology for treatment of immunobullous diseases, generalized eczematous disorders and photodermatoses. There is an enzyme in the metabolism of azathioprine called thiopurine s-methyltransferase (TPMT). It is very important to measure the TPMT activity before initiating therapy so that proper dosing of azathioprine can be achieved.
Research on antimetabolites of nucleic acid purines led to drugs for the treatment of acute leukemia (6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine), gout and hyperuricemia (allopurinol), and herpesvirus infections (acyclovir), and for the prevention of organ transplant rejection (azathioprine).
6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is widely used for the treatment of paediatric leukaemia and lymphoma. Recently, germline variants in the NUDT15 gene have been identified as one of the major genetic causes for 6-MP-associated adverse effects such as myelosuppression. Patients with hypomorphic NUDT15 variants accumulate excessive levels of DNA-incorporated thioguanine in white blood cells, resulting in severe myelosuppression. Although preclinical studies suggest that these variants may influence the protein stability of NUDT15, this has not been directly characterised in patients. In this study, we report the development of a series of novel monoclonal antibodies against NUDT15, using which we quantitatively assessed NUDT15 protein levels in 37 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with 6-MP, using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The NUDT15 genotype was highly correlated with its protein levels (p < 0.0001), with homozygous and compound heterozygous patients showing exceedingly low NUDT15 expression. There was a positive correlation between NUDT15 protein level and 6-MP tolerance (r = 0.631, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, our results point to low NUDT15 protein abundance as the biochemical basis for NUDT15-mediated 6-MP intolerance, thus providing a phenotypic readout of inherited NUDT15 deficiency.
