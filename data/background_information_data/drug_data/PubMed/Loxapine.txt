PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last ten years, the treatment of psychosis has seen a near explosion of creative development in both novel agents and new delivery modalities. The current review summarizes these developments over the past decade (2011-2020). We performed a systematic review utilizing PubMed and PsychInfo with the aim of identifying all the RCT and related analyses in adults with psychosis (schizophrenia and mania). RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 11 significant developments: the introduction of new antipsychotics cariprazine, brexpiprazole, lumateperone, and pimavanserin; introduction of new delivery methods: subcutaneous long-acting risperidone, aripiprazole lauroxil, transdermal asenapine, and inhaled loxapine; and the introduction of new approaches such as olanzapine/samidorphan for olanzapine-associated weight gain, examination of the TAAR1 agonist SEP 363,856 as a test of concept, and the combination of Xanomeline/Trospium, an M(1) and M(4) muscarinic receptor agonist in conjunction with a peripheral anticholinergic. Last decade has seen a tremendous development in second-generation antipsychotics which provides unprecedented treatment options for clinicians in treating psychosis.
OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants in KCNT2 are rare causes of developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). We herein describe the phenotypic and genetic features of patients with KCNT2-related DEE, and the in vitro functional and pharmacological properties of KCNT2 channels carrying 14 novel or previously untested variants. METHODS: Twenty-five patients harboring KCNT2 variants were investigated: 12 were identified through an international collaborative network, 13 were retrieved from the literature. Clinical data were collected and included in a standardized phenotyping sheet. Novel variants were detected using exome sequencing and classified using ACMG criteria. Functional and pharmacological studies were performed by whole-cell electrophysiology in HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: The phenotypic spectrum encompassed: (a) intellectual disability/developmental delay (21/22 individuals with available information), ranging from mild to severe/profound; (b) epilepsy (15/25); (c) neurological impairment, with altered muscle tone (14/22); (d) dysmorphisms (13/20). Nineteen pathogenic KCNT2 variants were found (9 new, 10 reported previously): 16 missense, 1 in-frame deletion of a single amino acid, 1 nonsense, and 1 frameshift. Among tested variants, 8 showed gain-of-function (GoF), and 6 loss-of-function (LoF) features when expressed heterologously in vitro. Quinidine and fluoxetine blocked all GoF variants, whereas loxapine and riluzole activated some LoF variants while blocking others. INTERPRETATION: We expanded the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of KCNT2-related disorders, highlighting novel genotype-phenotype associations. Pathogenic KCNT2 variants cause GoF or LoF in vitro phenotypes, and each shows a unique pharmacological profile, suggesting the need for in vitro functional and pharmacological investigation to enable targeted therapies based on the molecular phenotype.

The early and correct assessment of psychomotor agitation (PMA) is essential to ensure prompt intervention by healthcare professionals to improve the patient's condition, protect healthcare staff, and facilitate future management. Proper training for recognizing and managing agitation in all care settings is desirable to improve patient outcomes. The best approach is one that is ethical, non-invasive, and respectful of the patient's dignity. When deemed necessary, pharmacological interventions must be administered rapidly and avoid producing an excessive state of sedation, except in cases of severe and imminent danger to the patient or others. The purpose of this brief review is to raise awareness about best practices for the management of PMA in emergency care situations and consider the role of new pharmacological interventions in patients with agitation associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
Despite unmet meeds regarding efficacy, tolerability and time of onset and the high importance of mental disorders very few new psychotropics have been introduced in Germany recently. Lurasidon and the new multimodal antidepressant vortioxetine demonstrating clinical efficacy in the improvement of cognition have been withdrawn from the German market due to economic reasons based on an official committee judgement "missing additional benefit". Among new substances introduced are the selective opioid modulator nalmefene for reduction of alcohol consumption, the selective alpha-2-receptor agonist guanfacine for ADHS treatment in child and youth psychiatry, the older antidepressant milnacipran and the glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor agonist liraglutide for treatment of adipositas. In the USA the atypical antipsychotics cariprazine and brexpiprazole have been released. The introduction of the long acting depot antipsychotics aripiprazole (1 month) and paliperidone (3 months) can be seen as major progress in the treatment of schizophrenia. Loxapine is available as inhalative antipsychotic for rapid treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and mania. Atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine are recommended now as add-on treatment for therapy-resistant depressions. Ketamine and botulinum toxin are in experimental use as antidepressants. The development of psychotropics is long lasting and costly and made even more difficult by negative medial attitudes additionally. Constructive resolving attempts are needed urgently to avoid a standstill in the development of psychotropic drugs.
Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a debilitating neurological disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1%; there is a strong genetic component, with an estimated heritability of 80-85%. Although post-mortem studies have revealed reduced brain volume, cell size, spine density and abnormal neural distribution in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of SCZD brain tissue and neuropharmacological studies have implicated dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic activity in SCZD, the cell types affected in SCZD and the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease state remain unclear. To elucidate the cellular and molecular defects of SCZD, we directly reprogrammed fibroblasts from SCZD patients into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and subsequently differentiated these disorder-specific hiPSCs into neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1). SCZD hiPSC neurons showed diminished neuronal connectivity in conjunction with decreased neurite number, PSD95-protein levels and glutamate receptor expression. Gene expression profiles of SCZD hiPSC neurons identified altered expression of many components of the cyclic AMP and WNT signalling pathways. Key cellular and molecular elements of the SCZD phenotype were ameliorated following treatment of SCZD hiPSC neurons with the antipsychotic loxapine. To date, hiPSC neuronal pathology has only been demonstrated in diseases characterized by both the loss of function of a single gene product and rapid disease progression in early childhood. We now report hiPSC neuronal phenotypes and gene expression changes associated with SCZD, a complex genetic psychiatric disorder.
