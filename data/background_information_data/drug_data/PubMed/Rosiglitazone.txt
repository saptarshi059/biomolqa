BACKGROUND: The efficacy of thiazolidinediones, as compared with other oral glucose-lowering medications, in maintaining long-term glycemic control in type 2 diabetes is not known. METHODS: We evaluated rosiglitazone, metformin, and glyburide as initial treatment for recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial involving 4360 patients. The patients were treated for a median of 4.0 years. The primary outcome was the time to monotherapy failure, which was defined as a confirmed level of fasting plasma glucose of more than 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter), for rosiglitazone, as compared with metformin or glyburide. Prespecified secondary outcomes were levels of fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a cumulative incidence of monotherapy failure at 5 years of 15% with rosiglitazone, 21% with metformin, and 34% with glyburide. This represents a risk reduction of 32% for rosiglitazone, as compared with metformin, and 63%, as compared with glyburide (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The difference in the durability of the treatment effect was greater between rosiglitazone and glyburide than between rosiglitazone and metformin. Glyburide was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (including congestive heart failure) than was rosiglitazone (P<0.05), and the risk associated with metformin was similar to that with rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone was associated with more weight gain and edema than either metformin or glyburide but with fewer gastrointestinal events than metformin and with less hypoglycemia than glyburide (P<0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: The potential risks and benefits, the profile of adverse events, and the costs of these three drugs should all be considered to help inform the choice of pharmacotherapy for patients with type 2 diabetes.

The study aims to explore the effect of PPARgamma signaling on ferroptosis and preeclampsia (PE) development. Serum and placental tissue are collected from healthy subjects and PE patients. The PPARgamma and Nrf2 decreases in the PE. Rosiglitazone intervention reverses hypoxia-induced trophoblast ferroptosis and decreases lipid synthesis by regulating Nfr2 and SREBP1. Compared to the Hypoxia group, the migratory and invasive abilities enhance after rosiglitazone and ferr1 treatment. Rosiglitazone reduces the effect of hypoxia and erastin. The si-Nrf2 treatment attenuats the effects of rosiglitazone on proliferation, migration, and invasion. The si-Nrf2 does not affect SREBP1 expression. PPARgamma agonists alleviates ferroptosis in the placenta of the PE rats. The study confirms that PPARgamma signaling and ferroptosis-related indicators were dysregulated in PE. PPARgamma/Nrf2 signaling affects ferroptosis by regulating lipid oxidation rather than SREBP1-mediated lipid synthesis. In conclusion, our study find that PPARgamma can alleviate PE development by regulating lipid oxidation and ferroptosis.
Granulomatous hepatitis has many causes. Drugs are an important etiologic factor. Several oral hypoglycemic agents are available for treatment of type II diabetes. Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is a newer agent in this class. It has not been shown to be hepatotoxic in the premarketing trials. However, a few case reports have implicated it as a cause of acute hepatocellular injury. The authors report a case of granulomatous hepatitis associated with use of rosiglitazone. Liver function tests should be done regularly to monitor patients on this medication.
Postsurveillance data should be systematically collected, timely, and publicly available
Rosiglitazone, a potent thiazolidinedione oral antidiabetic agent recently approved in the US, differs structurally from pioglitazone and troglitazone (other approved thiazolidinediones), with greater PPAR gamma binding affinity and antihyperglycaemic potency in preclinical models. Clinical data on more than 4500 patients with type 2 diabetes show that rosiglitazone is a safe, effective monotherapy or combination therapy, producing significant reductions in haemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose under different dosing regimens. Unlike troglitazone, which has been associated with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and rare cases of liver failure and death, rosiglitazone has shown a low incidence of liver abnormalities in more than 3500 patient-years of exposure. No significant food or drug interactions have been reported. Particularly effective as first-line therapy, rosiglitazone is a useful addition to the roster of oral antidiabetic agents.
