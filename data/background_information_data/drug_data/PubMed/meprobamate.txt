Zolpidem (Ambien) is an imidazopyridine hypnotic recently introduced in the USA. We report a case of a fatal overdose of Ambien. A 68-year-old female ingested at least 30 tablets of 10 mg Ambien (300 mg). She was found dead at home. Toxicological analyses revealed blood concentration of 4.1, 19.3 and 2.3 micrograms/ml of zolpidem, meprobamate and carisoprodol, respectively.
According to the 3rd German Oral Health Study (1999), the prevalence of painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) is about 5%. Although limited information about the magnitude of utilization of health care services and expenses for health care in temporomandibular pain patients is available, the financial burden of affected individuals may be considerable. The etiology and pathophysiology of chronic TMDs is still obscure. However, certain (patho)physiological mechanisms may be associated with the genesis and perpetuation of these musculoskeletal facial pains (e. g. disturbances in central nervous system processing; psychosocial factors; hormonal influences). Strong scientific evidence from the dental/medical literature is currently available for the following forms of TMD treatment and management: occlusal appliances (stabilization appliance), clonazepam, diazepam, meprobamate, EMG biofeedback, multimodal approaches (somatic and psychological pain management).
This article describes several examples where the development of drugs and devices for use in psychiatry followed from initial serendipitous observations. The potential psychotropic properties of chlorpromazine (Thorazine((R))) were first noted in surgical patients when the drug was being investigated as a potentiator of anesthesia. Similar findings were noted with iproniazid (Marsilid((R))), developed for the treatment of tuberculosis, and the drug was later released for clinical use as an antidepressant agent. The development of meprobamate (Miltown((R))), an approved treatment for anxiety, evolved from initial efforts to find a chemical that would inhibit the enzymatic destruction of the antibiotic drug penicillin. The psychiatric uses of lamotrigine (Lamictal((R))) and vagus nerve stimulation were prompted by initial observations that epilepsy patients receiving these treatments had positive mood effects. Nurses should be familiar with the concept of serendipity, as they often are in the best position to observe, record, and report on unexpected clinical effects in patients taking any kind of prescription or nonprescription medication.
BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-treated patients experience anxiety anticipating the treatment, often to such an extent that they refuse or discontinue a much-needed treatment. Despite its great impact on treatment adherence, anxiety in patients receiving ECT is underexposed in the scientific literature. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the prevalence and specific subjects of ECT-related anxiety and therapeutic interventions to reduce it. METHODS: We performed a computerized search (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) for articles meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) qualitative (interview) studies, quantitative (questionnaire) studies, or experimental (interventional) studies that (2) report on anxiety that is related to a planned, ongoing, or past ECT treatment. RESULTS: Of 1160 search results, 31 articles were included. Electroconvulsive therapy-related anxiety is estimated to be present in 14% to 75% of patients and is most often linked to worries about memory impairment or brain damage. Only a few interventions (chlorpromazine, meprobamate, propofol, a talking-through technique, an information leaflet, and animal-assisted therapy) have been proposed to reduce patients' ECT-related anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy-related anxiety is a highly prevalent phenomenon, and the literature provides little guidance for its clinical management. Most studies are of a low methodological quality and suffer from significant limitations, thereby hampering generalized conclusions. Given the clinical importance of ECT-related anxiety, further study on its nature and evolution through the course of treatment and on anxiety-reducing interventions is warranted.
A case involving a suicidal overdose resulting from the ingestion of 90 tablets (400 mg) of meprobamate is presented. The drug was quantified using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). While the blood level was 204.6 micrograms/ml, the maximum concentration was found in the heart (708 micrograms/g), confirming the cardiac toxicity of meprobamate. Other drugs were not detected.
