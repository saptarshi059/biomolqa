Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a heterogeneous class, varying in pharmacologic properties, which have different therapeutic impacts on patient profiles, including lipophilicity, tissue-ACE binding, duration of action, half-life, and increased bradykinin availability. Among the ACE inhibitor class, the agent perindopril, in particular, has pleiotropic effects that are not equally shared by other ACE inhibitors, including bradykinin site selectivity and subsequent enhancement of nitric oxide and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that perindopril therapy may reduce cardiovascular event rates in patients, yet perindopril is rarely prescribed in the United States. Ramipril is another ACE inhibitor with both a favorable clinical profile and impressive outcomes data. Our review compares the pharmacologic and trial data among perindopril, ramipril, and other ACE inhibitors. In patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease who do not have heart failure, or in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, perindopril should be among the preferred treatment agents in the ACE inhibitor class. Ramipril has an impressive track record of improving cardiovascular outcomes, too, and should be considered a preferred agent among the ACE inhibitor class.
AIMS: Many patients who receive a diagnosis of heart failure have neither a low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction nor valve disease. Few substantial randomized controlled trials have been conducted in this population, none has focussed on patients with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and none has shown clear benefit on symptoms, morbidity, or mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a randomized double-blind trial, comparing placebo with perindopril, 4 mg/day in patients aged > or =70 years with a diagnosis of heart failure, treated with diuretics and an echocardiogram suggesting diastolic dysfunction and excluding substantial LV systolic dysfunction or valve disease. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned heart failure related hospitalization with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. A total of 850 patients were randomized. Their mean age was 76 (SD 5) years and 55% were women. Median follow-up was 2.1 (IQR 1.5-2.8) years. Enrollment and event rates were lower than anticipated, reducing the power of the study to show a difference in the primary endpoint to 35%. Many patients withdrew from perindopril (28%) and placebo (26%) after 1 year and started taking open-label ACE-inhibitors. Overall, 107 patients assigned to placebo and 100 assigned to perindopril reached the primary endpoint (HR 0.919: 95% CI 0.700-1.208; P = 0.545). By 1 year, reductions in the primary outcome (HR 0.692: 95% CI 0.474-1.010; P = 0.055) and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.628: 95% CI 0.408-0.966; P = 0.033) were observed and functional class (P < 0.030) and 6-min corridor walk distance (P = 0.011) had improved in those assigned to perindopril. CONCLUSION: Uncertainty remains about the effects of perindopril on long-term morbidity and mortality in this clinical setting since this study had insufficient power for its primary endpoint. However, improved symptoms and exercise capacity and fewer hospitalizations for heart failure in the first year were observed on perindopril, during which most patients were on assigned therapy, suggesting that it may be of benefit in this patient population.
We report two cases of perindopril-associated pneumonitis with typical drug-induced clinical features. In the first case, biopsies showed granulomatous sarcoid-like lesions; in the second, bronchial wall eosinophil infiltratf2p4was reported with increased blood eosinophil count. In these two cases, improvement was obtained by withdrawal of the drug and was completed with steroids. All other causes were ruled out. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced pneumonitis is still rare but has to be recognized as a real side-effect.
Perindopril is a third-generation ACE inhibitor that is characterised as a small, lipophilic molecule with a therapeutically active carboxyl side group. These and other features combine to make this a unique member of a very well-established class of drugs that have proven efficacy in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) demonstrated benefit in the secondary prevention of patients with stroke, whereas the Perindopril and Remodelling in Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction (PREAMI) trial supports extended routine use after myocardial infarction. The most recent evidence from the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA) and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) show that perindopril is able to improve the prognosis of patients with a relatively low global cardiovascular risk, denoted either by the presence of stable coronary artery disease or of essential hypertension in conjunction with at least three other risk factors. The fact that major relative risk reductions have been reported for these two studies is matched by the significance of the findings to modern clinical practice. Both studies were conducted in the context of advance concomitant care that is typically better in clinical trials than in routine practice. In particular, the benefits observed were seen to be of a similar magnitude, and also independent of those resulting from statin therapy. Of particular interest is the likely complimentary action of these treatment strategies with regard to the stabilisation of atheromatous plaques. Perindopril is a well-established drug, the full value of which is only now becoming fully apparent.
BACKGROUND: Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces the rate of cardiovascular events among patients with left-ventricular dysfunction and those at high risk of such events. We assessed whether the ACE inhibitor perindopril reduced cardiovascular risk in a low-risk population with stable coronary heart disease and no apparent heart failure. METHODS: We recruited patients from October, 1997, to June, 2000. 13655 patients were registered with previous myocardial infarction (64%), angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (61%), coronary revascularisation (55%), or a positive stress test only (5%). After a run-in period of 4 weeks, in which all patients received perindopril, 12218 patients were randomly assigned perindopril 8 mg once daily (n=6110), or matching placebo (n=6108). The mean follow-up was 4.2 years, and the primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Mean age of patients was 60 years (SD 9), 85% were male, 92% were taking platelet inhibitors, 62% beta blockers, and 58% lipid-lowering therapy. 603 (10%) placebo and 488 (8%) perindopril patients experienced the primary endpoint, which yields a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI 9-29, p=0.0003) with perindopril. These benefits were consistent in all predefined subgroups and secondary endpoints. Perindopril was well tolerated. INTERPRETATION: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease without apparent heart failure, perindopril can significantly improve outcome. About 50 patients need to be treated for a period of 4 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Treatment with perindopril, on top of other preventive medications, should be considered in all patients with coronary heart disease.
