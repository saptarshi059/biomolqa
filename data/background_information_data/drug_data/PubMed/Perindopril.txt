BACKGROUND: Blood pressure is an important determinant of the risks of macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, and guidelines recommend intensive lowering of blood pressure for diabetic patients with hypertension. We assessed the effects of the routine administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-diuretic combination on serious vascular events in patients with diabetes, irrespective of initial blood pressure levels or the use of other blood pressure lowering drugs. METHODS: The trial was done by 215 collaborating centres in 20 countries. After a 6-week active run-in period, 11 140 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to treatment with a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide or matching placebo, in addition to current therapy. The primary endpoints were composites of major macrovascular and microvascular events, defined as death from cardiovascular disease, non-fatal stroke or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and new or worsening renal or diabetic eye disease, and analysis was by intention-to-treat. The macrovascular and microvascular composites were analysed jointly and separately. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00145925. FINDINGS: After a mean of 4.3 years of follow-up, 73% of those assigned active treatment and 74% of those assigned control remained on randomised treatment. Compared with patients assigned placebo, those assigned active therapy had a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 5.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 2.2 mm Hg. The relative risk of a major macrovascular or microvascular event was reduced by 9% (861 [15.5%] active vs 938 [16.8%] placebo; hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00, p=0.04). The separate reductions in macrovascular and microvascular events were similar but were not independently significant (macrovascular 0.92; 0.81-1.04, p=0.16; microvascular 0.91; 0.80-1.04, p=0.16). The relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 18% (211 [3.8%] active vs 257 [4.6%] placebo; 0.82, 0.68-0.98, p=0.03) and death from any cause was reduced by 14% (408 [7.3%] active vs 471 [8.5%] placebo; 0.86, 0.75-0.98, p=0.03). There was no evidence that the effects of the study treatment differed by initial blood pressure level or concomitant use of other treatments at baseline. INTERPRETATION: Routine administration of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide to patients with type 2 diabetes was well tolerated and reduced the risks of major vascular events, including death. Although the confidence limits were wide, the results suggest that over 5 years, one death due to any cause would be averted among every 79 patients assigned active therapy.
A spectrofluorimetric approach that is sensitive, simple, validated, and cost-effective has been proposed for the estimation of amlodipine (AML) and perindopril (PER) in their bulk powders, pharmaceutical formulations, and spiked human plasma. The recommended approach utilized the quantitative quenching effect of the two cited drugs on the fluorescence intensity of erythrosine B, as a result of complex binary reactions among each drug with erythrosine B at pH 3.5 (Teorell and Stenhagen buffer). The quenching of erythrosine B fluorescence was recorded at 554 nm after excitation at 527 nm. The calibration curve was detected in the range 0.25-3.0 mug ml(-1) , with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996 for AML, and 0.1-1.5 mug ml(-1) , with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996 for PER. The established spectrofluorimetric approach was validated for the estimation of the cited drugs with high sensitivity regarding International Council on Harmonization guidelines. Therefore, the established approach could be utilized for quality control of the cited drugs in their pharmaceutical formulations.
Thrombotic events are highly prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in patients presenting with risk factors of adverse outcomes such as obesity. Recently, the associations between the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway and thrombosis have been reported. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used cardiovascular pharmacologic agents that upregulate ACE2 levels. An observation of the alterations in pro-coagulation factors after exposure to ACEIs and ARBs may provide valuable insight into the thrombosis mechanism and how it may relate to ACE2. This study use adipose tissue harvested from an obese male donor was isolated and exposed to perindopril, losartan, and ACE2 recombinant as binding assay, following exposure with 10 nm of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein. After 48 hours, tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as pro-coagulation factors as well as ACE2 levels and binding evaluated. The results shows TF level was significantly reduced in Perindopril group compared to control (4.834; p=0.005), while a non-significant reduction was observed in Losartan group (5.624; p=0.111). However, Losartan group showed a better reduction of PAI-1 levels (2.633; p</=0.001) than Perindopril group (3.484; p=0.001). These findings were consistent with the observations in ACE2 recombinant group, suggesting that both drugs lowered the bindings of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. This study indicated that both perindopril and losartan may attenuate pro-coagulation factors in human adipocytes exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and therefore showcased a potential role of ACE2 in the mechanism of COVID-19-related thrombosis. Further investigation in non-COVID-19 populations should commence and may be of value to expanding this potential in general cardiovascular diseases.
INTRODUCTION: Hypertension represent the commonest cause of death in 2017. Hypertension is classified into two types which are primary or essential hypertension and secondary hypertension. The perindopril-amlodipine combination showed a significant effect in reduction of the elevated BP and the cardiovascular complications. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose single-pill combination of perindopril-amlodipine in hypertensive patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, SCOPUS, and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials. Quality appraisal was evaluated according to GRADE and we assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. We included the following outcomes: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean blood pressure, heart rate, cough, dizziness, headache, and peripheral edema. We performed the analysis of homogeneous data under the fixed-effects model, while analysis of heterogeneous data was analyzed under the random-effects model. We conducted a meta-regression according to the dose. RESULTS: We included ten clinical trials. The pooled analysis showed that there was a significant reduction of the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse plessure, mean blood pressure, and heart rate after the the perindopril-amlodipine combination (MD = 18.96 [14.32, 23.60], P < 0.0001), (MD = 11.90 [8.45, 15.35], P < 0.0001), (MD = 8.44 [6.91, 9.97], P = 0.0001), (MD = 13.07 [5.86, 20.29], P = 0.0004), and (MD = 2.93 [0.89, 4.96], P = 0.005), respectively. The results of the meta-regression revealed that the efficacy is increased by increasing the dose (P < 0.001) CONCLUSION: The use of the perindopril-amlodipine combination had a significant effect on the reduction of SBP, DBP, mean blood pressure, pulse pressure, and HR.
BACKGROUND: Despite the overwhelming evidence and the established benefits of antihypertensive treatment, adherence to treatment remains low. OBJECTIVE: To assess the adherence to treatment with a perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine single-pill combination (SPC), its effectiveness on blood pressure (BP) reduction, as well as the safety and tolerability of this SPC over a 4-month treatment period. METHODS: This multicenter, non-interventional study prospectively included 2285 hypertensive patients on perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine SPC. The data were recorded at baseline, 1 month, and 4 months. RESULTS: Of the 2285 hypertensive patients included in the study, 50.5% were at "high/very high risk". Mean systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) decreased from 162.3 +/- 13.3/93.1 +/- 9.3 mmHg at baseline to 129.7 +/- 8.3/78.6 +/- 7.1 mmHg at 4 months (p < 0.001). Patients with higher baseline BP levels showed greater BP reduction. Patients with hypertension stages 1, 2, and 3 showed mean SBP/DBP reductions of 21.5/10.4 mmHg, 34.2/14.7 mmHg, and 51.2/22.5 mmHg, respectively, at study end (p < 0.001). Only 26 patients (1.1%) prematurely discontinued treatment (0.58% due to an adverse reaction or event). CONCLUSIONS: Perindopril/indapamide/amlodipine SPC decreased BP levels rapidly and significantly. The degree of BP reduction was associated with the severity of hypertension and/or with total cardiovascular risk at baseline. Simplifying the drug regimen by using this SPC improved adherence and showed excellent tolerability.
BACKGROUND: Rosuvastatin Calcium and Ezetimibe are used to control cholesterol level while Perindopril Erbumine is used to treat hypertension. Hepatic metabolism reduces the therapeutic effect of these drugs. OBJECTIVE: Instant release buccal films (IRBFs) could possibly be a solution to this issue. The objective of the study was to formulate IRBFs of Rosuvastatin Calcium, Perindopril Erbumine and Ezetimibe using solvent casting technique. METHODS: Polymers used to prepare IRBFs included hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E5), PEG 400 (as plasticizer) and Tween 80 (as surfactant). Solvent casting technique was used to fabricate the films, followed by their in-vitro analysis including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared evaluation (FTIR), In-vitro dissolution, In-vitro disintegration, stability tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), folding fortitude, thickness evaluation, surface pH, tensile strength, weight variation and percentage moisture content. RESULTS: Optical microscopy as well as SEM analysis displayed that the surfaces of IRBFs were smooth with uniform mixing of ingredients. IRBFs disintegrated within 15 seconds while on dissolution they exhibited instant drug release i.e. 100% release in 2 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The results show promising potential of IRBFs in drug delivery.
Hypertension is a major cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, and blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment substantially reduces the risk. This review compares the available clinical evidence from the BP-lowering and CV-outcome studies of telmisartan and perindopril, which are among the most intensively studied members of their respective classes. The PubMed database was searched for telmisartan and perindopril publications meeting the following criteria: 1) head-to-head comparison trials for BP lowering; and 2) CV-outcome studies (ie, ones with a CV event, mortality, or hospitalization outcome) in patients with CV risk factors but without heart failure. In comparative trials, telmisartan treatment resulted in significantly higher reduction in trough BP and mean ambulatory diastolic BP for the last 8 hours of the dosing interval compared with perindopril. In mainly placebo-controlled CV-outcome studies in patients with hypertension, CV benefits with perindopril were associated with large reductions in BP. There were no CV outcome studies with telmisartan in patients with hypertension. The beyond-BP-lowering CV-protective benefits of telmisartan were demonstrated in the active-controlled ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) trial, which included patients with controlled BP at baseline. In general, the trials discussed in this review reinforce the fact that perindopril and telmisartan are two long-acting antihypertensive drugs that reduce BP over 24 hours, and are the best-evidenced drugs in their class with proven CV protection. It is also clear that the benefits are not a "class effect", and vary between the different drugs within each class. Hence, the best approach for treatments tailored to individual patient needs should be evidence-based specific drugs, rather than a drug-class recommendation for achieving therapeutic targets.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this non-interventional post-marketing clinical trial was to analyze the antihypertensive effect and safety of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide in the treatment of unregulated essential hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospective clinical trial included patients aged 20 to 75 years with essential hypertension and blood pressure values >/= 140/90 mmHg at baseline. On the basis of the investigator's decision, patients received 2 mg perindopril + 0.625 mg indapamide (group 2+0.625) or 4 mg perindopril + 1.25 mg indapamide (group 4+1.25). RESULTS: The study included 1173 patients (426 patients in group 2+0.625 and 747 patients in group 4+1.25) at 27 investigational centers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mean blood pressure values at baseline and visits after nine months were significantly higher in the 4+1.25 group compared to the 2+0.625 group. There was a significant drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups. The target values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, according to the European Society of Cardiology (2018), were reached after nine months of therapy by more than 80% of patients in the 2+0.625 group, and this number was significantly higher compared to the 4+1.25 group where more than 60% of patients reached target values. Newly diagnosed patients had a better response to therapy. The percentage of patients receiving additional antihypertensive therapy decreased by the end of the study. Age, gender and the existence of diabetes mellitus were identified as negative predictors of target blood pressure achievement. The therapy showed a good safety profile. CONCLUSION: A fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide was effective and safe in the treatment of unregulated essential hypertension.
INTRODUCTION: Differences in class or molecule-specific effects between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors have not been conclusively demonstrated. This study used South African data to assess clinical and cost outcomes of antihypertensive therapy with the three most common RAAS inhibitors: perindopril, losartan and enalapril. METHODS: Using a large, South African private health insurance claims database, we identified patients with a hypertension diagnosis in January 2015 receiving standard doses of perindopril, enalapril or losartan, alone or in combination with other agents. From claims over the subsequent 5 years, we calculated the risk-adjusted rate of the composite primary outcome of myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure or stroke; rate of all-cause mortality; and costs per life per month (PLPM), with adjustments based on demographic characteristics, healthcare plan and comorbidity. RESULTS: Overall, 32,857 individuals received perindopril, 16,693 losartan and 13,939 enalapril. Perindopril-based regimens were associated with a significantly lower primary outcome rate (205 per 1000 patients over 5 years) versus losartan (221; P < 0.0001) or enalapril (223; P < 0.0001). The risk-adjusted all-cause mortality rate was lower with perindopril than enalapril (100 vs. 139 deaths per 1000 patients over 5 years; P = 0.007), but not losartan (100 vs. 94; P = 0.650). Mean (95% confidence interval) overall risk-adjusted cost PLPM was Rands (ZAR) 1342 (87-8973) for perindopril, ZAR 1466 (104-9365) for losartan (P = 0.0044) and ZAR 1540 (77-10,546) for enalapril (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: In South African individuals with private health insurance, a perindopril-based antihypertensive regimen provided better clinical and cost outcomes compared with other regimens.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a heterogeneous class, varying in pharmacologic properties, which have different therapeutic impacts on patient profiles, including lipophilicity, tissue-ACE binding, duration of action, half-life, and increased bradykinin availability. Among the ACE inhibitor class, the agent perindopril, in particular, has pleiotropic effects that are not equally shared by other ACE inhibitors, including bradykinin site selectivity and subsequent enhancement of nitric oxide and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that perindopril therapy may reduce cardiovascular event rates in patients, yet perindopril is rarely prescribed in the United States. Ramipril is another ACE inhibitor with both a favorable clinical profile and impressive outcomes data. Our review compares the pharmacologic and trial data among perindopril, ramipril, and other ACE inhibitors. In patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease who do not have heart failure, or in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, perindopril should be among the preferred treatment agents in the ACE inhibitor class. Ramipril has an impressive track record of improving cardiovascular outcomes, too, and should be considered a preferred agent among the ACE inhibitor class.
We report two cases of perindopril-associated pneumonitis with typical drug-induced clinical features. In the first case, biopsies showed granulomatous sarcoid-like lesions; in the second, bronchial wall eosinophil infiltratf2p4was reported with increased blood eosinophil count. In these two cases, improvement was obtained by withdrawal of the drug and was completed with steroids. All other causes were ruled out. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced pneumonitis is still rare but has to be recognized as a real side-effect.
INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the real-life effectiveness of a single-pill combination (SPC) of bisoprolol/perindopril for controlling blood pressure (BP) and symptoms of angina in patients with hypertension and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: Eligible patients with arterial hypertension and a history of MI were aged 18-79 years and had initiated bisoprolol/perindopril SPC within 3 months of study enrollment as part of routine Russian clinical practice. The primary endpoint was mean change in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) at week 12 compared with baseline (data collected retrospectively). Secondary endpoints were assessed at weeks 4 and 12 and included mean change in resting heart rate (HR), proportion of patients reaching target level of resting HR, antianginal effectiveness of the SPC, and proportion of patients reaching target BP levels. RESULTS: A total of 504 patients were enrolled, of whom 481 comprised the full analysis set (mean age 61.4 +/- 8.9 years, 68% men). Mean baseline SBP/DBP and HR values were 148.9 +/- 16.8/87.7 +/- 11.0 mmHg and 77.4 +/- 10.5 bpm, respectively. Mean durations of hypertension and CAD were 12.8 +/- 8.4 and 6.1 +/- 6.3 years, respectively, and time since MI was 3.8 +/- 5.3 years. At week 12, SBP/DBP had decreased by 24.9/12.2 mmHg (P < 0.001 vs baseline). Target BP (< 140/90 mmHg) was achieved by 69.8% and 95.9% of patients at weeks 4 and 12, respectively, and target HR (55-60 bpm) by 17.3% and 34.5% at weeks 4 and 12 versus 3.1% at baseline (P < 0.001). Reductions in angina attacks, nitrate consumption, and improvements in HR were statistically significant. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Treatment of symptomatic patients with CAD, hypertension, and a history of MI with a bisoprolol/perindopril SPC was associated with significant decreases in SBP/DBP and a high proportion of patients achieving BP treatment goals. This was accompanied by improvements in angina symptoms and reductions in HR in a broad patient population representative of those seen in everyday clinical practice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of perindopril or barnidipine alone or combined with simvastatin on metabolic parameters and hepatic steatosis degree. One hundred and forty nine mild to moderate hypertensive, normocholesterolemic, overweight or obese outpatients with hepatic steatosis were enrolled. They were treated with perindopril 5mg/day, or barnidipine, 20mg/day, for 6 months; subsequently simvastatin, 20mg/day was added to both treatments for further 6 months. Blood pressure variation was recorded. Patients also underwent an ultrasound examination, at baseline and after 6, and 12 months. We also assessed: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), lipid profile, adiponectin (ADN), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TauNuF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C reactive protein (Hs-CRP). Both perindopril and barnidipine reduced blood pressure, with barnidipine being more effective. Barnidipine, but not perindopril, slightly decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides after 6 months compared to baseline; lipid profile improved in both groups when simvastatin was added. Regarding inflammatory parameters, barnidipine reduced TNF-a, IL-6, and Hs-CRP, both in monotherapy, and after simvastatin addition. Hepatic steatosis parameters improved only when simvastatin was added. We can conclude that barnidipine better reduced blood pressure compared to perindopril and inflammatory parameters. Regarding hepatic steatosis parameters, only the addition of simvastatin improved them. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02064218, ClinicalTrials.gov.
The purpose of this study was to elucidate the therapeutic effect of different antihypertensive drugs (amlodipine and perindopril) on hypertension induced by apatinib and bevacizumab. Sixty patients with hypertension treated with apatinib or bevacizumab were selected and divided into two groups: one group was treated with amlodipine and the other group was treated with perindopril. Before and after treatment, the dynamic blood pressure (BP) measurement (systolic BP [SBP] and diastolic BP [DBP]), echocardiography (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, interventricular septal thickness [IVST], left ventricular posterior wall thickness [LVPWT], and left atrial diameter [LAD]), and detection of nitric oxide (NO) content in venous blood were performed. In the amlodipine group, the 24hSBP, 24hSSD, 24hSCV, daytime mean SBP (dSBP), daytime mean SSD (dSSD), daytime mean SBP CV, night mean SBP (nSBP), night mean SSD, 24hDBP, 24hDSD, 24 h DBP CV, daytime mean DBP (dDBP), daytime mean DSD (dDSD), daytime mean DBP CV, night mean DBP (nDBP), LAD, and LAD index (LADi) after treatment were all lower than before treatment, while NO was higher than before treatment (all P < 0.05). In the perindopril group, the 24hSBP, dSBP, nSBP, 24hDBP, dDBP, nDBP, LAD, LADi, IVST, LVPWT, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) after treatment were lower than before treatment, and NO level after treatment was higher than before treatment (all P < 0.05). After treatment, the 24hSBP, 24hSSD, dSBP, dSSD, nSBP, 24hDBP, 24hDSD, dDBP, dDSD, nDBP, night mean DSD, and NO were all lower while the LAD, LADi, IVST, LVPWT, and LVMI were higher in the amlodipine group than those in the perindopril group (all P < 0.05). Our study suggests that the SBP and DBP variability of amlodipine in the treatment of hypertension induced by apatinib and bevacizumab is slightly better than that of perindopril, but the effect of perindopril in improving endothelial function indices NO and echocardiographic data is better than that of amlodipine.
Impurity profiling has a rising importance nowadays due to the increased health problems associated with impurities and degradation products found in several drug substances and formulations. Three advanced, accurate and precise chemometric methods were developed as impurity profiling methods for a mixture of bisoprolol fumarate (BIS) and perindopril arginine (PER) with their degradation products which represent drug impurity or a precursor to such impurity. The methods applied were Partial Least Squares (PLS-1), Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used as a variable selection tool to select the most significant wavelengths for the three chemometric models. For proper analysis, a 5-factor 5-level experimental design was used to establish a calibration set of 25 mixtures containing different ratios of the drugs and their degradation products (impurities). The validity of the proposed methods was assessed using an independent validation set. The designed models were able to predict the concentrations of the drugs and the degradation products/impurities in the validation set and pharmaceutical formulation. The proposed methods presented a powerful alternative to traditional and expensive chromatographic methods as impurity profiling tools.
BACKGROUND: Antihypertensives bisoprolol fumarate (BIS) and perindopril arginine (PER) were simultaneously determined in their pure, bulk, and combined tablet dosage form. OBJECTIVE: This study develops a novel, reproducible, and accurate Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) with photodiode array detection techniques, which were then applied to in vitro dissolution studies. METHODS: The first RP-HPLC method relied on isocratic elution using a mobile phase of methanol-0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 2.6 (1 + 1, by volume), and separation was performed using a Thermo Hypersil C8 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mum). Ion-pair UPLC was the second method. An acceptable resolution was achieved using an RP-C18 chromatographic column, Agilent Eclipse (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mum), with a mobile phase containing 0.005 M sodium 1-heptane sulfonate-triethylamine (64 + 1 + 35, by volume), adjusted with phosphoric acid to a pH of 2.0. RP-HPLC used a 1.0 mL/min flow rate, while UPLC used 0.5 mL/min, and the two methods used detection at 210 nm. RESULTS: Calibration curves of BIS and PER were linear for RP-HPLC and RP-UPLC methods at 0.5-15 and 0.5-40 mug/mL, respectively. BIS and PER had RP-UPLC LODs of 0.22 and 0.10 mug/mL, respectively, and LOQs of 0.68 and 0.31 mug/mL, respectively. As a result, the approach has been effectively applied to in vitro dissolution testing for drugs in generic and reference products, showing that the two products are comparable. The Six Sigma approach was implemented to compare the recommended and United States Pharmacopeia (USP) procedures, which both exhibited process capability index (Cpk) >1.33. A content uniformity test demonstrated that the drugs in their dosage form met the acceptance limit (85-115%). The degradation products were reliably distinguished from pure drugs for a range of retention times. CONCLUSION: In their commercial drug product, the proposed method could be used in QC laboratories for concurrent testing, content uniformity, and in vitro dissolution investigations of BIS and PER. The methods were successfully validated per International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. HIGHLIGHTS: This study is innovative since it is the first to establish and validate specific and reproducible UPLC and HPLC methods for the concurrent quantitation of the studied drugs in their binary mixture and application to lean Six Sigma, content uniformity, and comparative dissolution approaches.
