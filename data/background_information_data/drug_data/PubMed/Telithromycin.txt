Vancomycin is considered the workhorse for the treatment of most drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. However, concerns have been raised regarding the increasing rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and the clinical shortcomings of vancomycin in the treatment of invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections. Resources have been committed to the development of antimicrobial agents with activity against these organisms. This review will focus on the newer antibacterial agents that have been developed for the treatment of resistant gram-positive pathogens. Included in this review are the agents: quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, telithromycin, and tigecycline.
The advanced macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and the ketolide telithromycin are structural analogues of erythromycin. They have several distinct advantages when compared with erythromycin including enhanced spectrum of activity, more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, once daily administration, and improved tolerability. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics, antimicrobial activity, clinical use, and adverse effects of these antimicrobial agents.
The fluoroketolide solithromycin is 2-fold more potent in vitro than telithromycin against pneumococci (including macrolide-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae and very active on pathogens causing atypical pneumonia. In contrast, it is a 30-fold less potent inhibitor of nicotinic receptors incriminated in telithromycin toxicity. In Phase II/III trials, oral solithromycin once-daily (800 mg on day 1; 400 mg on days 2-5) proved effective and safe when compared to respiratory fluoroquinolones for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). A Phase III intravenous trial vs. moxifloxacin has been recently completed for the same indication. Solithromycin may restore interest in ketolides as a first-line therapy for CAPB. Solithromycin safety should nevertheless be confirmed in larger populations allowing for detection of rare adverse events.
Recently, several new drugs for the treatment of bacterial infections have been developed. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin have been approved throughout the world for clinical use. Levofloxacin has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pnuemoniae. The Food and Drug Administration has approved linezolid for clinical use, and new drug applications for gemifloxacin and telithromycin were filed. Other new targets have surfaced in the quest for novel antibacterial agents.
