Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the major cardiovascular diseases affecting the global human population. This disease has been proved to be the major cause of death in both the developed and developing countries. Lifestyle, environmental factors, and genetic factors pose as risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of risk factors among healthy individuals elucidates the probable occurrence of CAD in near future. Genome-wide association studies have suggested the association of chromosome 9p21.3 in the premature onset of CAD. The risk factors of CAD include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, homocystinuria, and psychosocial stress. The eradication and management of CAD has been established through extensive studies and trials. Antiplatelet agents, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and ranolazine are some of the few therapeutic agents used for the relief of symptomatic angina associated with CAD.
Ischaemic heart disease is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, while angina represents its most common symptom. It is estimated that approximately 9 million patients in the USA suffer from angina and its treatment is challenging, thus the strategy to improve the management of chronic stable angina is a priority. Angina might be the result of different pathologies, ranging from the "classical" obstruction of a large coronary artery to alteration of the microcirculation or coronary artery spasm. Current clinical guidelines recommend antianginal therapy to control symptoms, before considering coronary artery revascularization. In the current guidelines, drugs are classified as being first-choice (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and short-acting nitrates) or second-choice (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine) treatment, with the recommendation to reserve second-line modifications for patients who have contraindications to first-choice agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. However, such a categorical approach is currently questioned. In addition, current guidelines provide few suggestions to guide the choice of drugs more suitable according to the underlying pathology or the patient comorbidities. Several other questions have recently emerged, such as: is there evidence-based data between first- and second-line treatments in terms of prognosis or symptom relief? Actually, it seems that newer antianginal drugs, which are classified as second choice, have more evidence-based clinical data that are more contemporary to support their use than what is available for the first-choice drugs. It follows that actual guidelines are based more on tradition than on evidence and there is a need for new algorithms that are more individualized to patients, their comorbidities, and pathophysiological mechanism of chronic stable angina.
Systemic antifungal therapy is critical for reducing the mortality from many invasive and chronic fungal infections. Triazole antifungals are the most frequently prescribed antifungals but require attention to dosing and drug interactions. Nearly 600 severe drug-drug interactions and over 1100 moderate interactions requiring dose modifications are described or anticipated with systemic antifungal agents (see https://www.aspergillus.org.uk/antifungal-drug-interactions/). In this article, we address the common and less common, but serious, drug interactions observed in clinical practice with triazole antifungals, including a group of drugs that cannot be prescribed with all or most triazole antifungals (ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, fentanyl, apomorphine, quetiapine, bedaquiline, rifampicin, rifabutin, sirolimus, phenytoin and carbamazepine). We highlight interactions with drugs used in children and new agents introduced for the treatment of haematological malignancies or graft versus host disease (midostaurin, ibrutinib, ruxolitinib and venetoclax). We also summarize the multiple interactions between oral and inhaled corticosteroids and triazole antifungals, and the strategies needed to optimize the therapeutic benefits of triazole antifungal therapy while minimizing potential harm to patients.
Microvascular angina (MVA) is defined as angina pectoris caused by abnormalities of small coronary arteries. In its most typical presentation, MVA is characterized by angina attacks mainly caused by effort, evidence of myocardial ischemia on non-invasive stress tests, but normal coronary arteries at angiography. Patients with stable MVA have excellent long-term prognoses, but often present with persistent and/or worsening of angina symptoms. Treatment of MVA is initially based on standard anti-ischemic drugs (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and nitrates), but control of symptoms is often insufficient. In these cases, several additional drugs, with different potential anti-ischemic effects, have been proposed, including ranolazine, ivabradine, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, xanthine derivatives, nicorandil, statins, alpha-blockers and, in perimenopausal women, estrogens. In patients with 'refractory MVA', some further alternative therapies (e.g., spinal cord stimulation, pain-inhibiting substances such as imipramine, rehabilitation programs) have shown favorable results.
Ranolazine derives from piperazine and has been approved as a drug for the therapy of chronic stable angina. It acts by selectively inhibiting the late sodium inward current. Moreover, ranolazine has other metabolic features which makes it effective in other diseases as well as coronary artery ones. In this paper I make an updated review of all possible therapeutic roles of ranolazine: through cardiology and beyond.
