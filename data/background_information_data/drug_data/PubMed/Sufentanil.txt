INTRODUCTION: Sufentanil is a selective micro-opioid agonist, used intravenously and intrathecally for moderate to severe acute pain. Sublingual sufentanil nanotablets have been developed; 15 mcg tablet for a patient-controlled analgesia device and 30-mcg tablet for a single-dose device administered by a healthcare professional. Dosing interval is a minimum of 20 min for a 15 mcg tablet and a treatment duration of up to 72 hours. The single 30-mcg nanotablet dosing interval is 1 hour. Mean plasma elimination half-life is 13 hours and bioavailability 47-57% after the first sublingual sufentanil tablet. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of sublingual sufentanil 30-mcg single dose suspended by a healthcare professional for the management of moderate to severe acute pain. A few Phase 4 studies concerning the sublingual sufentanil tablet system containing 15-mcg nanotablets are also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Sufentanil sublingual 30-mcg nanotablets provide effective pain relief in various acute moderate to severe pain states. The safety profile of sublingual sufentanil 30 mcg is typical to opioids nausea, vomiting, and sedation being the most common ones. Sublingual sufentanil 30-mcg nanotablet has the potential for efficient moderate to severe pain management in supervised healthcare facilities.
INTRODUCTION: Sufentanil is a potent synthetic opioid used for analgesia in neonates; however, data concerning drug disposition of sufentanil and dosage regimen are sparse in this population. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore sufentanil disposition and to propose optimal loading and maintenance doses of sufentanil in ventilated full-term neonates. METHODS: Individual sufentanil pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based on therapeutic drug monitoring data using a 2-compartmental model. Linear regression models were used to explore the covariates. RESULTS: The median (IQR) central volume of distribution (Vdc) and clearance (CL) for sufentanil were 4.7 (4.1-5.4) L/kg and 0.651 (0.433-0.751) L/h/kg, respectively. Linear regression models showed relationship between Vdc (L) and GA (r2 = 0.3436; p = 0.0452) as well as BW (r2 = 0.4019; p = 0.0268). Median optimal sufentanil LD and MD were 2.13 (95% CI: 1.78-2.48) mug/kg and 0.29 (95% CI: 0.22-0.37) mug/kg/h, respectively. Median daily COMFORT-B (IQR) scores ranged from 6 to 23 while no significant relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and COMFORT-B scores was found. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Body weight and gestational age were found as weak covariates for sufentanil distribution, and the dosage regimen was developed for a prospective trial.
BACKGROUND: Propofol-sufentanil is often used in clinical anesthesia for patients undergoing sedative gastroscopy, but there are still adverse events such as longer recovery time, respiratory depression and higher doses of propofol etc. This study was to evaluate the sedative effect of remimazolam-propofol-sufentanil in sedative gastroscopy. METHODS: Patients who were going to have gastroscopy examination were randomly divided into two groups: group RM (remimazolam-propofol-sufentanil group) and group PR (propofol-sufentanil group). Patients of each group were anesthetized according to the corresponding anesthesia procedure, and all observation indices were recorded. RESULTS: In the RM group, there were only small and unsignificant changes in the values of SBP, HR, RR and SpO<inf>2</inf> after anesthesia (P>0.05), while the values of SBP, HR, RR and SpO<inf>2</inf> in the PR group at each time point after anesthesia were significantly lower than those at T0, and the values of SBP and RR at T2, T3 and T4 were also significantly lower than those at T1 (P<0.05). The dosage of propofol (38+/-9 mg) in the RM group was significantly less than that (115+/-15 mg) in the PR group, meanwhile the anesthesia time (8.4+/-1.6 min), awakening time (2.9+/-0.8 min), discharge time (6.7+/-3.1 min) of the RM group were also significantly shorter than those of the PR group (14.5+/-3.3, 8.7+/-1.9, 12.4+/-3.6 min) (P<0.05), but there was no statistical significance between the two groups in other indices (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, remimazolam-propofol-sufentanil sedative scheme has more advantages than propofol-sufentanil sedative scheme.
BACKGROUND AND AIM: The analgesic effect on labour pain of either spinal or epidural sufentanil or fentanyl was tested in a total of 80 primiparous parturients at an early phase of the delivery. The aim of the study was to compare the level of analgesia achieved within 20 minutes. METHODS: The parturients were randomly assigned to groups receiving either spinal sufentanil (5 microg), epidural sufentanil (20 microg), spinal fentanyl (20 microg) or epidural fentanyl (100 microg), whereafter the parturients were monitored for reported pain during contraction and side effects for 30 minutes. The primary outcome was the level of analgesia achieved within 20 minutes, while the secondary outcome was the time until the administration of the first epidural bolus. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean maximum pain VAS was 86 (84-89) mm. At 20 minutes after spinal sufentanil, epidural sufentanil, spinal fentanyl or epidural fentanyl, the maximum VAS was 19 (7-31), 45 (32-59), 25 (10-39) or 52 (40-63) mm, respectively (P < .01 spin vs epid groups). There were no differences in efficacy between spinal or epidural sufentanil and fentanyl. The mean (95% CI) time to the activation of epidural analgesia was 151 (111-192), 130 (93-168), 177 (121-234) and 112 (80-143) minutes after spinal sufentanil, epidural sufentanil, spinal fentanyl and epidural fentanyl, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of a reduction of VAS score at 20 minutes, epidural sufentanil or fentanyl provide 63% and 60% of the analgesic effect of the corresponding spinal analgesia. Epidural sufentanil or fentanyl could be used in situations in which spinal/CSE administration is not possible or desired.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to compare and evaluate the side effects (SEs) and sedation characteristics of synergistic sedation with doses of 0.25 mug kg-1 or 0.5 mug kg-1 intranasal (IN) sufentanil, and intravenous (IV) midazolam during propofol-based sedation in patients undergoing colonoscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. The patients were randomly allocated into one of 3 groups: group I (n = 33) - sufentanil IN 0.5 mug kg-1; group II (n = 33) - sufentanil IN 0.25 mug kg-1; and group III (n = 33) - IN 0.9% NaCl ( placebo ) and IV 0.04 mg kg-1 midazolam. After 15 minutes, all patients received 0.5 mg kg-1 propofol intravenously. Cardiorespiratory side effects and sedation characteristics were compared. RESULTS: The propofol consumption in group III was significantly higher than in group I and II (P < 0.001). Spontaneous eye opening time was significantly longer in group III than in group I and II ( < 0.001). The patients in group III had significantly longer recovery times than patients in group I and II (P < 0.0001). Hypotension and bradycardia were not encountered during the study. The incidence of hypoxaemia was significantly greater in group III compared to other groups (P < 0.001). Pain control and endoscopist satisfaction was significantly better for group I and II than for group III (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Synergistic sedation can be achieved safely and effectively by the combination of propofol and IN sufentanil or IV midazolam for colonoscopy. However, IN sufentanil can be considered as a reasonable alternative to IV midazolam due to less respiratory depression, and better pain control and endoscopist satisfaction.
BACKGROUND: Sufentanil sublingual tablet system (SSTS) is a recently approved formulation for postoperative pain management that has become popular due to its pharmacokinetic properties such as good bioavailability, rapid attainment of equilibrium and elimination without any metabolites, along with its pharmacodynamic properties such as rapid onset and effective pain reduction. It is also relatively well tolerated by patients. OBJECTIVE: This is a quantitative analysis of the efficacy and safety of SSTS in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain. DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases such as Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for eligible articles. SETTINGS: Randomised controlled trials published after 2000 in English language and which assessed at least one of the outcome measures of interest with pain intensity difference between 12 hours and a maximum of 96 hours. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with moderate to severe postoperative pain and taking SSTS for pain management. METHODS: Data were analysed using Review Manager (RevMan) V.5.3. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment was done using RoB-2 scale, and overall grading of evidence of each outcome was done using GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. RESULTS: Analysis of SSTS versus control indicates a statistically significant reduction in summed pain intensity difference at 12 hours (mean difference (MD)=-12.33 (95% CI -15.5 to -9.17), p<0.00001), summed pain intensity difference at 48 hours (MD=-43.57 (95% CI -58.65 to -28.48), p<0.00001), time-weighted total pain relief over 12 hours (MD=-4.77 (95% CI -6.28 to -3.27), p<0.00001) and pain intensity difference (MD=-0.73 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.46), p<0.00001) with SSTS, alongside high quality of evidence. Success of treatment as assessed by Patient Global Assessment (OR=4.01 (95% CI 2.74 to 5.89), p<0.00001) and Healthcare Professional Global Assessment (OR=4.46 (95% CI 3.03 to 6.56), p<0.00001) scoring at 72 hours was observed in a significantly high number of individuals using SSTS, with high quality of evidence. There was no difference in adverse events except for dizziness (RR=1.90, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.52). There was a significantly higher number of total adverse events in orthopaedic surgery in the SSTS group than in the comparator. CONCLUSION: SSTS is effective in postoperative pain management in patients with moderate to severe pain. It also has good tolerability and high patient satisfaction.

BACKGROUND This study aimed to retrospectively assess and compare the safety and efficacy of sufentanil and fentanyl in the treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 85 patients with traumatic brain injury from June 2016 to September 2018 were included in this study, and were enrolled into a sufentanil group and a fentanyl group according to different treatment methods. The patients in both groups were assessed with the Critical care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) for analgesic score, and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for sedation score. RESULTS The scores of CPOT and RASS in the 2 groups were significantly lower than before treatment (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The heart rate (HR), rate of spontaneous respiration (RR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the 2 groups were significantly lower than before treatment (P<0.05), and the RR of the sufentanil group was significantly lower than that of the fentanyl group at all time points after treatment (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Sufentanil has a rapid onset of effect, and it is safe, stable, and effective for patients with traumatic brain injury in the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with fentanyl, sufentanil can also effectively shorten mechanical ventilation time, time to obtain satisfactory sedation and analgesia, and the length of hospitalization in the ICU.
Saddle spinal is a reliable method for control of pain during labor. This method has rapid onset and causes complete sensory block without significant influence on motor neurons.Our goal was to compare the analgesic efficacy and side effects of pethidine and sufentanil via saddle spinal administration during labor.600 parturients requesting analgesia were randomly divided into 2 groups. First group was composed of 300 patients received 0.4 mg/kg pethidine and the second group was composed of 300 patients received 0.1 mug/kg sufentanil. Then, analgesia according to Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), itching, nausea, apnea and urinary retention were examined between 2 groups.VAS=3 was noted in both groups. Equal rate of apnea was seen in both groups. Patients received pethidine showed significantly a higher rate of nausea compared with sufentanil group (P<0.0001). Pruritus was significantly higher in patients received sufantanil (P<0.0001).Our findings suggest that saddle spinal by pethidine or sufentanil causes a considerable analgesia for labor. Proper management of the untoward effects of this method may introduce it as a safe and low-cost method for painless labor.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the impacts of 0.15% ropivacaine alone and 0.15% ropivacaine combined with sufentanil on epidural labor analgesia. METHODS: A total of 297 eligible primiparae were randomly divided into group A (n=149, 0.15% ropivacaine + sufentanil) and group B (n=148, 0.15% ropivacaine). Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores prior to analgesia and 20 min following epidural medication, the maximum VAS score during labor, dosage of analgesic drugs, modified Bromage score, satisfaction degree, labor duration, delivery mode, 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores of newborns, adverse reactions during analgesia, and fever during labor were recorded. RESULTS: Group A and B had similar VAS scores 20 min following epidural medication and maximum score during labor (P>0.05), which significantly fell compared with those before labor analgesia (P<0.05). The occurrence rates of nausea and vomiting were of significant difference (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: 0.15% ropivacaine alone achieves a comparable epidural labor analgesia effect to that of 0.15% ropivacaine + 0.05 microg/mL sufentanil on primiparae.
Our aim was to describe the effect of dosing and genetic factors on sufentanil- and midazolam-induced analgosedation and withdrawal syndrome (WS) in pediatric population. Analgosedation and withdrawal syndrome development were monitored using COMFORT-neo/-B scores and SOS score. Length of therapy, dosing of sufentanil and midazolam were recorded. Genotypes of selected candidate polymorphisms in CYP3A5, COMT, ABCB1, OPRM1 and PXR were analysed. In the group of 30 neonates and 18 children, longer treatment duration with midazolam of 141 h (2 - 625) vs. 88 h (7 - 232) and sufentanil of 326.5 h (136 - 885) vs. 92 h (22 - 211) (median; range) was found in the patients suffering from WS vs. non-WS group, respectively. Median midazolam cumulative doses were in the respective values of 18.22 mg/kg (6.93 - 51.25) vs. 9.94 mg/kg (2.12 - 49.83); P=0.03, and the respective values for sufentanil were 88.60 microg/kg (20.21 - 918.52) vs. 21.71 microg/kg (4.5 - 162.29); P<0.01. Cut off value of 177 hours for sufentanil treatment duration represented predictive factor for WS development with 81 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity. SNPs in the candidate genes COMT, PXR and ABCB1 affected the dosing of analgosedative drugs, but were not associated with depth of analgosedation or WS. Cumulative dose and length of analgosedative therapy with sufentanil significantly increases the risk of WS in critically ill neonates and children.
It remains unclear whether reduced myocardial contractility, venous dilation with decreased venous return, or arterial dilation with reduced systemic vascular resistance contribute most to hypotension after induction of general anesthesia. We sought to assess the relative contribution of various hemodynamic mechanisms to hypotension after induction of general anesthesia with sufentanil, propofol, and rocuronium. In this prospective observational study, we continuously recorded hemodynamic variables during anesthetic induction using a finger-cuff method in 92 non-cardiac surgery patients. After sufentanil administration, there was no clinically important change in arterial pressure, but heart rate increased from baseline by 11 (99.89% confidence interval: 7 to 16) bpm (P < 0.001). After administration of propofol, mean arterial pressure decreased by 23 (17 to 28) mmHg and systemic vascular resistance index decreased by 565 (419 to 712) dyn*s*cm(-5)*m(2) (P values < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure was < 65 mmHg in 27 patients (29%). After propofol administration, heart rate returned to baseline, and stroke volume index and cardiac index remained stable. After tracheal intubation, there were no clinically important differences compared to baseline in heart rate, stroke volume index, and cardiac index, but arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index remained markedly decreased. Anesthetic induction with sufentanil, propofol, and rocuronium reduced arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index. Heart rate, stroke volume index, and cardiac index remained stable. Post-induction hypotension therefore appears to result from arterial dilation with reduced systemic vascular resistance rather than venous dilation or reduced myocardial contractility.
Alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil are synthetic opioid analgesics acting at specific opioid receptors. These opioids are widely used as analgesics to supplement general anaesthesia for various surgical procedures or as primary anaesthetic agents in very high doses during cardiac surgery. Fentanyl and sufentanil especially are administered via infusion for long term analgesia and sedation in intensive care patients. Opioid analgesics are mainly administered using the intravenous route. However, other techniques of administration, including epidural, intrathecal, transdermal and intranasal applications, have been demonstrated. Important pharmacokinetic differences between alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil have been shown in many reports. Alfentanil has the most rapid analgesic onset and time to peak effect as well as the shortest distribution and elimination half-lives. The volume of distribution and total body clearance of this agent are smaller when compared with those of fentanyl and sufentanil. The pharmacokinetics of the opioid analgesics can be affected by several factors including patient age, plasma protein content, acid-base status and cardiopulmonary bypass, but not significantly by renal insufficiency or compensated hepatic dysfunction. In addition, pharmacokinetic properties can be influenced by changes in hepatic blood flow and administration of drug combinations which compete for the same plasma protein carrier or metabolising pathway. Although comparing specific pharmacokinetic parameters such as half-lives is deeply entrenched in the literature and clinical practice, simply comparing half-lives is not a rational way to select an opioid for specific requirements. Using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models, computer simulations based on changes in the effect site opioid concentration or context-sensitive half-times seem to be extremely useful for selecting an opioid on a more rational basis.
OBJECTIVE: To review the basic and clinical pharmacology of three opioids to assist in the nursing care of postoperative patients. METHODS: The authors discuss the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil and compare them with other opioids. A discussion of the nursing care of patients who receive these agents both intravenously and epidurally is provided along with a nursing care plan. Common opioid-related side effects and their treatments are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil are potent synthetic opioids that are used for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. The advantages of these opioids compared with morphine are short duration of action, lack of hyperglycemic response to surgery, decrease in catecholamine levels, and high lipid solubility. The nursing care of patients receiving these opioids involves frequent assessment of the degree of analgesia and monitoring for and treatment of side effects.
PURPOSE: The present study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of computed tomography-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) to treat pulmonary nodules under conscious analgosedation with sufentanil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: February to May 2021, 124 patients with 151 pulmonary nodules were enrolled in this study. The patients underwent 124 sessions of MWA. Sufentanil (0.25 mug/kg) was injected intravenously before MWA. RESULTS: The technical success was 100% and no procedure-related deaths. The dosage of sufentanil was 16.6 +/- 3.0 mug. The mean tumor diameter in the enrolled patients was 1.3 +/- 0.8 cm. The intraoperative mean numerical rating scale (NRS) was 2.2 +/- 1.7. Among the patients with NRS >3, seven patients had nodules adjacent to the pleura, while in ten patients, they were not adjacent. The mean systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate of patients were 139.1 +/- 23.5 mmHg, 77.8 +/- 12.3, and 76.1 +/- 13.4 times/min, respectively, before sufentanil injection. The mean lowest systolic, lowest diastolic blood pressure, and lowest heart rate intraoperative were 132.9 +/- 22.0 mmHg, 76.1 +/- 12.1, and 74.0 +/- 13.5 times/min. Twenty-six patients had mild adverse events including nausea (6.45%, 8/124), dizziness (2.42%, 3/124), vomiting(4.03%, 5/124), nausea and dizziness (2.42%, 3/124), nausea with vomiting and dizziness (2.42%, 3/124), urinary retention (1.61%, 2/124) and respiratory depression (0.81%, 1/124). CONCLUSION: Sufentanil is a feasible, safe, and effective analgesic for MWA in patients with pulmonary nodules. It can be used for clinical promotion.
BACKGROUND: Transforming a drug from its commercial form into a ready-to-use drug is common practice, especially in pediatrics. However, the risk of compounding error is real and data on drug stability in practice are not always available. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess, in real conditions, both the error rate and stability of three drugs: ketamine, remifentanil, and sufentanil. METHODS: A new rapid and easy-to-use high-performance liquid chromatography method with a diode array detector has been developed and validated to quantify these drugs and detect their degradation products. Over a 1-month period, 151 syringes were collected in the postanesthesia care unit. Seventy-three were stock solution syringes containing a 10-fold dilution of commercial drugs and 78 were serial dilution syringes made from successive dilutions of stock solutions. A comparison between real and expected concentrations as well as the detection of possible degradation products was carried out on these samples. RESULTS: All stock solution syringes had good chemical stability throughout the working day. A 4-microg/mL remifentanil serial dilution syringe, however, had to be discarded as a degradation peak was detected. Overall, 15.3% (95% CI, 9.5-21.1%) of syringes had a drug concentration outside the +/-10% acceptability range, that is, 11.0% (95% CI, 3.7-18.2%) and 19.5% (95% CI, 10.6%-28.4%) of stock and diluted syringes respectively, with drug amounts ranging from -25.3% to 22.0%. The highest error rates were observed with sufentanil syringes: 20% and 28% for stock solution and serial dilution, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study shows that stock solution syringes prepared in advance are chemically stable throughout the day, unlike certain serial dilution syringes, indicating that the latter should be prepared just before administration to ensure chemical stability. Our results show that the error rate for serial dilution syringes is twice that of stock solution. Different safety measures are under discussion and have to be further studied.
BACKGROUND: Minor but painful medical procedures are often handled at the operating room. If safe and effective treatment options are available many procedures may be performed outside of the operating room. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study is to assess the adverse events of intranasal s-ketamine and/or sufentanil alone or as part of a multimodal analgesic regime for medical procedures outside of the operating room. Secondary outcomes included analgesic effect, doses and indications for use. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary care paediatric hospital. PATIENTS: Children 1 year up till 18 years. INTERVENTION(S): Intranasal (IN) sufentanil (S), intranasal s-ketamine (K) or the free combination of the two drugs (SK). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The frequency of adverse events including serious adverse events reported by intervention. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2014, 2185 medical procedures were registered, including 652 procedures with IN SK, 1469 procedures with IN S and 64 procedures with IN K. The children's median age was 5.6 years (range 1.0-17.9). Medical procedures with at least one adverse event were 18% with IN SK, 25% with IN K and 18% with IN S. Common adverse events included episodes of vomiting (9%), nausea (8%) and dizziness (3%). In two patients receiving IN S, serious adverse events occurred. One patient had respiratory depression and bronchospasm and another patient with cerebral palsy had a seizure. Both were handled immediately and did not result in any sequelae. The median doses of intranasal sufentanil were 38% lower when combined with s-ketamine (IN SK free combination: sufentanil dose 0.5 mug/kg (range 0.2-1.3) and s-ketamine dose 0.5 mg/kg (range 0.2-1.5). IN S monotherapy, sufentanil dose 0.8 mug/kg (range 0.2-2.7)). Similar analgesic effect was reported for S and SK. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal sufentanil and/or s-ketamine are feasible for the treatment of procedural pain in an ambulatory setting with appropriate per- and post-procedural observations and trained staff.
