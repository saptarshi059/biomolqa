Firmly tied: The binding affinity of amiloride for an abasic (AP) site-containing RNA duplex is two orders of magnitude superior to the affinity of the corresponding AP site-containing DNA duplex. The observed high binding affinity for the RNA duplex arises from a favorable enthalpy gain. The binding-induced fluorescence response of amiloride is applicable to microRNA detection.
Fungal infections have become an increasing threat as a result of growing numbers of susceptible hosts and diminishing effectiveness of antifungal drugs due to multi-drug resistance. This reality underscores the need to develop novel drugs with unique mechanisms of action. We recently identified 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride (HMA), an inhibitor of human Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1, as a promising scaffold for antifungal drug development. In this work, we carried out susceptibility testing of 45 6-substituted HMA and amiloride analogs against a panel of pathogenic fungi. A series of 6-(2-benzofuran)amiloride and HMA analogs that showed up to a 16-fold increase in activity against Cryptococcus neoformans were identified. Hits from these series showed broad-spectrum activity against both basidiomycete and ascomycete fungal pathogens, including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
Albuminuria in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is associated with hypertension and aberrant glomerular filtration of serine proteases that may proteolytically activate the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). The present nonrandomized, pharmacodynamic intervention study aimed to investigate if inhibition of ENaC increases Na(+) excretion and reduces extracellular volume in KTRs dependent on the presence of albuminuria. KTRs with and without albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g, n = 7, and <30 mg/g, n = 7, respectively) were included and ingested a diet with fixed Na(+) content (150 mmol/day) for 5 days. On the last day, amiloride at 10 mg was administered twice. Body weight, 24-h urine electrolyte excretion, body water content, and ambulatory blood pressure as well as plasma renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone concentrations were determined before and after amiloride. Amiloride led to a significant decrease in body weight, increase in 24-h urinary Na(+) excretion, and decrease in 24-h urinary K(+) excretion in both groups. Urine output increased in the nonalbuminuric group only. There was no change in plasma renin, aldosterone, and angiotensin II concentrations after amiloride, whereas a significant decrease in nocturnal systolic blood pressure and increase in 24-h urine aldosterone excretion was observed in albuminuric KTRs only. There was a significant correlation between 24-h urinary albumin excretion and amiloride-induced 24-h urinary Na(+) excretion. In conclusion, ENaC activity contributes to Na(+) and water retention in KTRs with and without albuminuria. ENaC is a relevant pharmacological target in KTRs; however, larger and long-term studies are needed to evaluate whether the magnitude of this effect depends on the presence of albuminuria.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Amiloride has a significant natriuretic effect in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) that relates to urinary albumin excretion. The epithelial Na(+) channel may be a relevant direct pharmacological target to counter Na(+) retention and hypertension in KTRs. Epithelial Na(+) channel blockers should be further investigated as a mean to mitigate Na(+) and water retention and to potentially obtain optimal blood pressure control in KTRs.
This study was undertaken to investigate the interaction between the sodium channel blocker amiloride (AML) and human serum albumin (HSA). A combination of multi-spectroscopic techniques and computational methods were employed to identify the AML binding site on HSA and the forces responsible for the formation of the HSA-AML complex. Our findings revealed that AML specifically binds to Sudlow's site II, located in subdomain IIIA of HSA, and that the complex formed is stabilized using van der Waals hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. FRET analysis showed that the distance between AML and Trp214 was optimal for efficient quenching. UV-Vis spectroscopy and circular dichroism indicated minor changes in the structure of HSA after AML binding, and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) conducted over 100 ns provided additional evidence of stable HSA-AML-complex formation. This study enhances understanding of the interaction between AML and HSA and the mechanism responsible.
The K(+)-sparing diuretic amiloride shows off-target anti-cancer effects in multiple rodent models. These effects arise from the inhibition of two distinct cancer targets: the trypsin-like serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a cell-surface mediator of matrix degradation and tumor cell invasiveness, and the sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE1), a central regulator of transmembrane pH that supports carcinogenic progression. In this study, we co-screened our library of 5- and 6-substituted amilorides against these two targets, aiming to identify single-target selective and dual-targeting inhibitors for use as complementary pharmacological probes. Closely related analogs substituted at the 6-position with pyrimidines were identified as dual-targeting (pyrimidine 24 uPA IC(50) = 175 nM, NHE1 IC(50) = 266 nM, uPA selectivity ratio = 1.5) and uPA-selective (methoxypyrimidine 26 uPA IC(50) = 86 nM, NHE1 IC(50) = 12,290 nM, uPA selectivity ratio = 143) inhibitors, while high NHE1 potency and selectivity was seen with 5-morpholino (29 NHE1 IC(50) = 129 nM, uPA IC(50) = 10,949 nM; NHE1 selectivity ratio = 85) and 5-(1,4-oxazepine) (30 NHE1 IC(50) = 85 nM, uPA IC(50) = 5715 nM; NHE1 selectivity ratio = 67) analogs. Together, these amilorides comprise a new toolkit of chemotype-matched, non-cytotoxic probes for dissecting the pharmacological effects of selective uPA and NHE1 inhibition versus dual-uPA/NHE1 inhibition.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure of nebulized and oral amiloride in adolescents and adults with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Open-label, randomized, two-way crossover, single-dose pharmacokinetic study. SETTING: University hospital clinical research unit. PATIENTS: Nine adolescents and 10 adults with mild to moderate CF (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec > or = 50% predicted, Brasfield score > or = 15). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received amiloride solution orally (10 mg of amiloride 1-mg/ml solution) and by inhalation [4.5 ml amiloride of 1-mg/ml solution in 12% saline (approximately 3.8 mmol/L) by DeVilbiss 646 nebulizer] during two study phases separated by a 7- to 28-day washout period. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for 48 and 72 hours, respectively. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After oral dosing, the mean +/- SD maximum peak concentration (Cmax) was 20.6 +/- 10.0 ng/ml at 3.2 +/- 1.2 hours in adults and 21.7 +/- 4.88 at 2.9 +/- 0.6 hours in the adolescents. Mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity hours was 275 +/- 115 and 254 +/- 60 ng.hr/ml in the adult and adolescent groups; half-life was 16.0 +/- 0.7 and 13.4 +/- 1.4 hours, respectively. After nebulization, 14 of 19 subjects exhibited two concentration peaks (Cmax1 and Cmax2) with mean values of 1.57 +/- 1.67 ng/ml at 0.5 +/- 0.2 hours and 1.37 +/- 1.21 ng/ml at 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours for adults, and 1.49 +/- 0.99 ng/ml at 0.5 +/- 0.1 hours and 1.52 +/- 0.81 ng/ml at 3.3 +/- 0.5 hours for adolescents. Estimated mean +/- SD dose nebulized was 1.91 +/- 0.66 and 2.28 +/- 0.30 mg in the adult and adolescent groups, respectively. Mean +/- SD AUC from time zero to the last measurable plasma amiloride concentration after inhalation was 14.4 +/- 17.6 and 15.4 +/- 10.1 ng.hr/ml in the adults and adolescents. No significant adverse events occurred during the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically different between the adolescent and adult groups by route of administration. However significant differences in peak amiloride concentration, AUC, and urinary amiloride excretion were evident when comparing oral versus inhalation administration within each group. CONCLUSIONS: Mean amiloride plasma concentration peaks and AUC after inhalation were significantly lower than after oral dosing. In addition, the second amiloride plasma concentration peak may be due to oral ingestion of the nebulized amiloride, whereas the earlier Cmax1 after inhalation may be due to pulmonary absorption of amiloride. These results suggest that single-dose amiloride inhalation in patients with mild to moderate CF results in minimal systemic exposure compared with oral dosing, and that drug disposition is similar in adolescents and adults with CF.
BACKGROUND: Salt delivery to the distal nephron and sodium reabsorption in this segment are considered critical factors that modulate kaliuresis in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Amiloride, a drug that blocks Na(+) reabsorption in the distal nephron, can help to assess the role of Na+ transport in this segment on the kaliuresis of CKD patients. METHODS: A bolus of amiloride (1 mg/kg body weight) followed by an intravenous infusion (1 mg/kg body weight per hour) was administered to 6 normal subjects and 10 patients with CKD undergoing water diuresis. Serum and urine electrolytes were measured. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured with clearance of (125)I-iodothalamate. RESULTS: Normal subjects and CKD patients had a control fractional excretion of potassium (FE(K)(+)) of 26% +/- 11% and 126% +/- 28%, respectively; the corresponding FE(Na)(+) was 2.3% +/- 0.8% and 15% +/- 3%. In response to amiloride, FE(Na)(+)increased significantly to 3.5% +/- 0.6% and 20% +/- 3% in normal and CKD subjects, respectively, and FE(K)(+) decreased significantly to 6.5% +/- 0.6% and 39% +/- 8%, respectively. Amiloride-sensitive and amiloride-insensitive kaliuresis in normal subjects were 71.4% and 28.6%, respectively; the corresponding values for CKD patients were 73% and 27%, respectively. Urine output correlated positively with kaliuresis in CKD. CONCLUSIONS: The very high FEK+ observed in CKD occurs in the absence of hyperkalemia and is largely amiloride-sensitive; therefore maintenance of potassium balance by the kidney in CKD is mostly dependent on sodium reabsorption through channels along the distal nephron. The high urinary flow of CKD further promotes potassium excretion.
1 A double-blind comparison of the effect of tienilic acid (250 mg) and amiloride (5 mg) on renal function in healthy volunteers and of tienilic acid plus amiloride compared to hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) plus amiloride in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension for safety and hypotensive efficacy was made. 2 Renal plasma flow ([I(125)] iodohippurate clearance) and glomerular filtration rate ([I(131)] iothalamate clearance and 24 h creatinine clearance) were not affected by tienilic acid or amiloride alone or in combination despite a rise in plasma urea and plasma creatinine (within the normal range) in healthy volunteers. 3 In hypertensive patients tienilic acid and tienilic acid plus amiloride treatments caused a rise in plasma urea and plasma creatinine similar to hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride but no significant change in creatinine clearance occurred with any of the treatments. 4 Tienilic acid and hydrochlorothiazide caused hypokalaemia in the patients which was normalized by addition of amiloride. Fewer subjects became hypokalaemic when amiloride was added to tienilic acid than when tienilic acid was given alone. 5 The antihypertensive effect of tienilic acid and tienilic acid plus amiloride was similar to hydrochlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide plus amiloride in patients with hypertension. No effect on blood pressure was observed in the healthy volunteers. 6 Plasma uric acid was significantly reduced by tienilic acid alone and in combination in patients and subjects whereas a significant elevation occurred with hydrochlorothiazide. 7 Side effects were increased when amiloride was added to either tienilic acid or hydrochlorothiazide, but side effects were less common after treatment with tienilic acid than following hydrochlorothiazide. 8 The combination of tienilic acid plus amiloride significantly reduces blood pressure and appears to be well tolerated with no adverse effects on renal function or plasma potassium in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and normal renal function. Addition of amiloride may be useful if hypokalaemia occurs following tienilic acid therapy in such patients.
The bacterial flagellum is powered by a rotary motor capable of turning the helical flagellar propeller at very high speeds. Energy to drive rotation is derived from the transmembrane electrochemical potential of specific ions. Ions passing through a channel component are thought to generate the force to power rotation. Two kinds of motors, dependent on different coupling ions, have been described: proton-driven and sodium-driven motors. There are four known genes encoding components of the sodium-powered polar flagellar motor in Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Two, which are characterized here, are homologous to genes encoding constituents of the proton-type motor (motA and motB), and two encode components unique to the sodium-type motor (motX and motY). The sodium-channel-blocking drugs phenamil and amiloride inhibit rotation of the polar flagellum and therefore can be used to probe the architecture of the motor. Mutants were isolated that could swim in the presence of phenamil or amiloride. The majority of the mutations conferring phenamil-resistant motility alter nucleotides in the motA or motB genes. The resultant amino acid changes localize to the cytoplasmic face of the torque generator and permit identification of potential sodium-interaction sites. Mutations that confer motility in the presence of amiloride do not alter any known component of the sodium-type flagellar motor. Thus, evidence supports the existence of more than one class of sodium-interaction site at which inhibitors can interfere with sodium-driven motility.
