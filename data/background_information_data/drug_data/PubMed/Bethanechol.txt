The urodynamic results in 68 females with urinary retention were reviewed. There were two groups: 39 patients with neurologic causes for retention, and 29 patients in whom possible causes for retention included: psychological history (15 patients), gynecologic pathology, and urinary tract infection. Nine patients in the neurogenic group and 13 patients in the non-neurogenic group had undergone urethral dilatation with no improvement. Upper urinary tract evaluation was unremarkable. Detrusor failure was the prominent bladder pattern in both groups. In the neurogenic group, low pressure detrusor activity was also present in 10 patients, 3 of whom had sphincter dyssynergia. Flow rate, surface electromyography, and bethanechol supersensitivity test could not help differentiate neurogenic from non-neurogenic detrusor failure. The notation of abnormal bladder sensation did significantly differ between the groups, but was of limited accuracy as an indicator of neurogenic retention. Self-intermittent catheterization was the most effective treatment for both groups, with some patients voiding adequately in follow-up. Although no one test can accurately differentiate neurogenic from nonneurogenic female urinary retention, careful neurourologic evaluation will help guide us to more appropriate management.
Reflux esophagitis is a common disorder in which esophageal inflammation is caused by the reflux of gastric contents. The diagnostic approach includes documentation that reflux is present, that the patient's symptoms are caused by the reflux, and that esophageal mucosal damage has occurred. Therapy is guided by the current multifactorial pathophysiology model, which includes efficacy of the antireflux mechanism, volume of gastric fluid, potency of refluxed material, esophageal clearance, and tissue resistance factors. Although recurrences are common, treatment with life style changes supplemented with combinations of liquid antacids, H2 blockers, sucralfate, bethanechol, and metoclopramide is usually effective.
In many solid tumors, parasympathetic input is provided by the vagus nerve, which has been shown to modulate tumor growth. However, whether cholinergic signaling directly regulates progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been defined. Here, we found that subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in LSL-Kras (+/G12D);Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice accelerated PDAC development, whereas treatment with the systemic muscarinic agonist bethanechol restored the normal KC phenotype, thereby suppressing the accelerated tumorigenesis caused by vagotomy. In LSL-Kras (+/G12D);LSL-Trp53 (+/R172H);Pdx1-Cre mice with established PDAC, bethanechol significantly extended survival. These effects were mediated in part through CHRM1, which inhibited downstream MAPK/EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways in PDAC cells. Enhanced cholinergic signaling led to a suppression of the cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment, CD11b(+) myeloid cells, TNFalpha levels, and metastatic growth in the liver. Therefore, these data suggest that cholinergic signaling directly and indirectly suppresses growth of PDAC cells, and therapies that stimulate muscarinic receptors may be useful in the treatment of PDAC.Significance: Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or Chrm1 knockout accelerates pancreatic tumorigenesis, in part via expansion of the CSC compartment. Systemic administration of a muscarinic agonist suppresses tumorigenesis through MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, in early stages of tumor growth and in more advanced, metastatic disease. Therefore, CHRM1 may represent a potentially attractive therapeutic target. Cancer Discov; 8(11); 1458-73. (c)2018 AACR. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1333.
In a double-blind, placebo controlled study of 10 infants with upper gastrointestinal motor disorders, metoclopramide (1 mg/kg, intravenous) but not bethanechol (0.075 mg/kg, subcutaneous), significantly increased the fractional rate of gastric emptying following a 5% glucose meal. Infants were tested on 3 consecutive days with a phenol red dye-dilution technique which, if combined with acid titration of gastric samples, permits simultaneous measurements of gastric volume, fractional emptying rate, fluid output, and acid output. Metoclopramide increased the fractional emptying rate in eight of 10 infants (mean +/- SE increasing from 4.6 +/- 0.6 to 7.3 +/- 1.0%/min, p less than 0.02). Neither drug altered gastric acid secretion, but metoclopramide significantly increased gastric fluid output (mean +/- SE increased from 3.5 +/- 0.6 to 6.5 +/- 1.4 ml/min, p less than 0.02). No undesirable side effects or complications occurred during testing. We conclude that trials are warranted to assess the clinical efficacy of metoclopramide in infants with nonobstructive causes of delayed gastric emptying.
The ability to void spontaneously was ascertained in 135 comatose patients, 76 per cent of whom emptied the bladder automatically as soon as the indwelling catheter could be removed. With additional treatment (bethanechol and/or intermittent catheterization), spontaneous micturition was achieved in all of the remaining patients. Elderly men had statistically more difficulties in becoming independent of an indwelling catheter.
