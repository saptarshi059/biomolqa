CONTEXT: Pretreatment with alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers is recommended to prevent hemodynamic instability during resection of a pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma (PPGL). OBJECTIVE: To determine which type of alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker provides the best efficacy. DESIGN: Randomized controlled open-label trial (PRESCRIPT; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01379898). SETTING: Multicenter study including 9 centers in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: 134 patients with nonmetastatic PPGL. INTERVENTION: Phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin starting 2 to 3 weeks before surgery using a blood pressure targeted titration schedule. Intraoperative hemodynamic management was standardized. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative intraoperative time outside the blood pressure target range (ie, SBP >160 mmHg or MAP <60 mmHg) expressed as a percentage of total surgical procedure time. Secondary efficacy endpoint was the value on a hemodynamic instability score. RESULTS: Median cumulative time outside blood pressure targets was 11.1% (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.3-20.6] in the phenoxybenzamine group compared to 12.2% (5.3-20.2)] in the doxazosin group (P = .75, r = 0.03). The hemodynamic instability score was 38.0 (28.8-58.0) and 50.0 (35.3-63.8) in the phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin group, respectively (P = .02, r = 0.20). The 30-day cardiovascular complication rate was 8.8% and 6.9% in the phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin group, respectively (P = .68). There was no mortality after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of blood pressure outside the target range during resection of a PPGL was not different after preoperative treatment with either phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. Phenoxybenzamine was more effective in preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability, but it could not be established whether this was associated with a better clinical outcome.
Purpose: Tamsulosin is formulated as sustained release beads within a capsule to prevent rapid absorption and associated hypotension. The package insert advises the capsule is swallowed whole; not crushed, chewed, or opened. To our knowledge, there are no current data on opening capsules for adults with enteral tube feeds. Given the unidentified safety and efficacy of administration via enteral tubes, alternative alpha blockers with less selectivity for alpha(1A) are often used. Methods: A single center retrospective chart review was conducted at two hospital sites. Adult patients that received at least one dose of tamsulosin or doxazosin while an enteral feeding tube was placed were included. Safety outcomes evaluated were the number of documented tube obstructions and incidence of medication associated hypotension. Results: 169 patients were included. Ten enteral feeding tube obstructions were reported, 4 of 110 (3.64%) in the tamsulosin arm and 6 of 59 (10.17%) in the doxazosin arm (RR .36, 95% CI .11 to 1.22, P = .099). At least 1 episode of medication associated hypotension occurred in 22 of 98 (22.45%) in the tamsulosin arm and 20 of 49 (40.82%) in the doxazosin arm (RR .55, 95% CI .33 to .91, P = .019). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in the number of tube obstructions between patients receiving tamsulosin or doxazosin via enteral tube feeds. Patients receiving doxazosin were at increased risk of experiencing medication related hypotension. Tamsulosin capsules may be opened and administered via enteral feeding tubes if administered with content integrity intact.
PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of doxazosin on autophagy and the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vivo and in vitro and determine the underlying mechanism. METHODS: In vivo, a mouse liver fibrosis model was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). Doxazosin was administered at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/(kg*day) by gavage. After 20 weeks, blood and liver tissues were collected for serological and histological analysis, respectively. Blood analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were used to measure the extent of liver fibrosis in model and control mice. In vitro, the human HSC cell line LX-2 was cultured and treated with different doses of doxazosin for the indicated times. The effects of doxazosin on LX-2 cell proliferation and migration were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays, respectively. The number of autophagosomes in LX-2 cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Infection with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3B adenovirus, GFP-red fluorescent protein (RFP)-LC3B adenovirus and mCherry-EGFP-LC3 adeno-associated virus was performed to examine changes in autophagic flux in vitro and in vivo. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry in vitro and by TUNEL assays both in vitro and in vivo. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate the expression levels of proteins related to fibrosis, autophagy, apoptosis, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). RESULTS: Doxazosin inhibited HSC proliferation and migration. HSC activation was attenuated by doxazosin in a concentration-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. Doxazosin also blocked autophagic flux and induced apoptosis in HSCs. In addition, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was activated by doxazosin and regulated fibrosis, autophagy and apoptosis in HSCs. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that doxazosin could inhibit autophagy by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and attenuate liver fibrosis.
BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia is commonly treated with alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) or 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. The long-term effect of these drugs, singly or combined, on the risk of clinical progression is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a long-term, double-blind trial (mean follow-up, 4.5 years) involving 3047 men to compare the effects of placebo, doxazosin, finasteride, and combination therapy on measures of the clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia. RESULTS: The risk of overall clinical progression--defined as an increase above base line of at least 4 points in the American Urological Association symptom score, acute urinary retention, urinary incontinence, renal insufficiency, or recurrent urinary tract infection--was significantly reduced by doxazosin (39 percent risk reduction, P<0.001) and finasteride (34 percent risk reduction, P=0.002), as compared with placebo. The reduction in risk associated with combination therapy (66 percent for the comparison with placebo, P<0.001) was significantly greater than that associated with doxazosin (P<0.001) or finasteride (P<0.001) alone. The risks of acute urinary retention and the need for invasive therapy were significantly reduced by combination therapy (P<0.001) and finasteride (P<0.001) but not by doxazosin. Doxazosin (P<0.001), finasteride (P=0.001), and combination therapy (P<0.001) each resulted in significant improvement in symptom scores, with combination therapy being superior to both doxazosin (P=0.006) and finasteride (P<0.001) alone. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride was safe and reduced the risk of overall clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia significantly more than did treatment with either drug alone. Combination therapy and finasteride alone reduced the long-term risk of acute urinary retention and the need for invasive therapy.
Experience with overdosage and toxicity with the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists remains very limited in the literature. In this paper, the second case in the literature with doxazosin overdosage is reported. Supportive treatment was given to the patient and the patient was discharged 48 hours after admission to the emergency department.
