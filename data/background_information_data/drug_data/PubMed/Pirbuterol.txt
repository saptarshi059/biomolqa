The beta(2) adrenoreceptor is a large molecule of some 413 amino acids. The duration of stimulation of this receptor depends on where and for how long a beta(2) adrenergic drug attaches itself to the beta(2) adrenoreceptor. beta(2) adrenergic drugs have been used for over 5,000 years, but only recently have we had the advantage of adrenergic drugs specific to the beta(2) adrenoreceptor. The short-acting beta(2) adrenergic drugs most frequently used include albuterol, pirbuterol, and levalbuterol. Levalbuterol, the R enantiomer of albuterol, has been described by some as a more effective bronchodilator than racemic albuterol, because it contains none of the S enantiomer. Some contend that the S isomer has pro-inflammatory properties. The 2 long-acting beta(2) adrenergic drugs are salmeterol and formoterol. These drugs have a duration of 12 h and reportedly improve forced expiratory volume in the first second, quality of life, and symptoms. Some recent reports indicate that these drugs are associated with higher mortality, but several authors have registered the opinion that it is not the bronchodilator that should be questioned, but instead that the fault lies in the patient recruitment in those studies. Regardless, if these long-acting drugs are effective for a given patient, it would seem inadvisable to withdraw them, given the current state of evidence. Arformoterol tartrate, the R enantiomer of formoterol, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2006; it is available as a nebulizer solution, to be administered every 12 h. Several other long-acting R isomers and RR isomers are in the approval pipeline.
In a double-blind trial the effects on ventilatory function (FEV1), heart rate and blood pressure of oral pirbuterol and oral salbutamol in various single doses were studied in ten patients with chronic asthma. Pirbuterol (15 mg) and salbutamol (4 mg) produced equal peak levels of bronchodilatation. There was no significant difference in the mean rise in heart rates caused by the two drugs, and no other significant side-effects were noted.
Cardiac inotropic activity can be triggered by beta 1-, beta 2- and alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the heart when stimulated with appropriate agonists. Dopaminergic receptor agonists have little influence on contractile force but the peripheral vasodilatation, improved renal perfusion and enhanced natriuresis mediated by dopaminergic receptor stimulation may improve a condition of congestive heart failure. After a general survey of cardiac beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptors and of dopaminergic receptors in the cardiovascular system, the following receptor-mediated inotropic drugs are discussed: isoprenaline, dobutamine, xamoterol, pirbuterol, terbutaline, salbutamol, dopamine, L-dopa and dopexamine. Attention is paid to the receptor profile of these compounds and to the scope and limitations of their application as inotropic drugs in the treatment of congestive heart failure.
Pirbuterol was given intravenously to nine normal men to determine the hemodynamic effects of intravenous injection of this rather selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. Pirbuterol induced marked improvement of the echocardiographic (percent change in the dimension of the minor axis of the left ventricle during systole, ejection fraction, and velocity of left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening) and systolic time interval (preejection period interval, preejection period/left ventricular ejection time) indices of ventricular performance. The increase in stroke volume was indicated by elevation of systolic blood pressure and widening of pulse pressure. Vascular beta 2-receptor agonist effects were indicated by the fall in diastolic and mean systemic blood pressure and marked reduction in derived systemic vascular resistance. Dose-related positive chronotropic properties were observed without dysrhythmias. There was a good direct correlation between mean plasma pirbuterol concentration and dose. Because of the reported efficacy of oral doses, the direct relationship between plasma concentration and dosage, the positive inotropic properties, and the peripheral vasodilating effects of pirbuterol, investigation of the intravenous form of the drug in patients with severe decompensated low-output congestive heart failure seems warranted.
Pirbuterol hydrochloride is a beta 2 adrenergic agonist with a structure similar to that of albuterol, except for the substitution of a pyridine ring for the benzene ring. It is comparable in duration of action to albuterol when given by inhalation, but it is threefold less potent by weight. In man, pirbuterol and albuterol have similar beta 2 selectivity. In the acute therapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pirbuterol is most effective in oral doses of 15-20 mg, and by aerosol in doses of 400 micrograms or greater. Long-term studies of oral pirbuterol in doses between 30-60 mg/day are promising, but further research is warranted. The combination of pirbuterol's beta 2 and lesser beta1 activity has proven helpful in the therapy of refractory congestive heart failure. Improvement of function of both right and left ventricles and systemic and pulmonic circulations has been demonstrated acutely. Drug effect wanes, as with other beta adrenergic agonists, due to the development of tolerance; however, long-term benefit appears to persist in both pulmonary and cardiac patients. Pirbuterol will be marketed in the United States as 10 and 15 mg tablets and as a 200 micrograms per actuation metered dose aerosol for use in pulmonary patients only; it will not be approved for use in congestive heart failure. In terms of beta 2 selectivity, duration of action, potency and frequency of side effects, pirbuterol is comparable to the two beta 2 agonists already available in the United States, albuterol and terbutaline.
