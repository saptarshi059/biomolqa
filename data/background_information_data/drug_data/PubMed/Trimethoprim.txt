Trimethoprim has recently been marketed as a single-entity product for the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated symptomatic urinary tract infections; it was previously available only in combination with sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim exerts antimicrobial activity by blocking the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, the active form of folic acid, by susceptible organisms. It has inhibitory activity for most gram-positive aerobic cocci and some gram-negative aerobic bacilli. Resistance to trimethoprim may be either intrinsic or acquired. Acquired resistance most commonly stems from a chromosomal mutation that results in the production of a dihydrofolate reductase enzyme which is less vulnerable to trimethoprim inhibition. Gastrointestinal intolerance and skin eruptions are the most common untoward reactions resulting from the administration of trimethoprim. Trimethoprim constitutes very effective therapy for women with acute symptomatic urinary tract infections caused by E. coli, and the compound compares favorably with alternative standard agents, such as ampicillin and cephalexin. The safety of trimethoprim in the pregnant woman has not been established. Since indiscriminate use of trimethoprim could foster the emergence of trimethoprim resistance, thereby negating the value of both trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim should only be prescribed for well defined indications. Trimethoprim is currently being investigated as definitive therapy for a wide range of infections, including bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia, and typhoid fever. Initial reports are encouraging.
The antimicrobial combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is active in vitro against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Clinically, it is useful for prophylaxis and treatment of selected infections of the genitourinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole by itself or in combination with other antimicrobial agents is indicated for most Nocardia asteroides infections and is the antimicrobial agent of choice for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The drug is relatively nontoxic in patients who do not have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and is available in both oral and intravenous forms. The native compounds and the metabolites of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are excreted primarily in the urine. When the creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min, the dosage of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be adjusted.
We reviewed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotic susceptibility testing data among Staphylococcus aureus using 3 national inpatient databases. In all 3 databases, we observed an increases in the percentage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that were not susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Providers should select antibiotic regimens based on local resistance patterns and should report changes to the public health department.
Nocardia can cause systemic infections with varying manifestations. Resistance patterns vary by species. We describe N. otitidiscavarium infection with pulmonary and cutaneous manifestations in a man in the United States. He received multidrug treatment that included trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole but died. Our case highlights the need to treat with combination therapy until drug susceptibilities are known.
A 52-year old woman developed severe cholestasis seven days after the administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (RMP-SMZ) The clinical and pathologic features are discussed as well as the various mechanisms of liver injury following TMP-SMZ use.
