PURPOSE: Valproic acid has been proposed as an alternative agent for treatment of agitation and delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical data to support the use of valproic acid for this indication are limited. The objective of this analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety associated with the use of valproic acid for the management of agitation and delirium in the ICU. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive analysis included patients who were prescribed valproic acid for a minimum of 3 days for the treatment of agitation and/or delirium in the cardiac, surgical, or medical ICU from May 31, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The prevalence of agitation and delirium was assessed during valproic acid therapy for up to 7 days. Additional data analyzed included opioid, sedative, and antipsychotic requirements and safety outcomes. FINDINGS: A total of 47 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was an observed downward trend in the prevalence of agitation (47.8% vs 16.7%) and delirium (84.8% vs. 63.3%) throughout valproic acid therapy. In addition, the proportion of patients who required dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and opioids decreased while patients were taking valproic acid. No adverse effects attributed to valproic acid occurred in this patient population. IMPLICATIONS: Valproic acid may be an alternative option to assist in the management of agitation and delirium in the ICU. Additional prospective data are needed to validate the use of this agent for the treatment of agitation and delirium in critically ill patients.
BACKGROUND: Valproic acid is one of the most commonly used antiseizure medications. Multiple hematologic abnormalities have been reported with the use of valproic acid, which may be particularly relevant in the perioperative surgical setting. The incidence of these abnormalities and prevalence of periprocedural hemorrhage vary significantly in the published literature. In this article we analyze the prevalence and possible etiology of coagulopathy and hemorrhage in patients receiving valproic acid. METHODS: A literature search was completed using "VPA," "coagulopathy," and "surgery." The available published data from case reports to large case series were reviewed. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia was noted to be the most common laboratory abnormality associated with valproic acid. An association between valproic acid and acquired von Willebrand disease has also been suggested. There are case reports describing bleeding in the setting of hypofibrinogenemia and factor XIII deficiency. Perioperative hemorrhage was reported in pediatric studies of orthopedic procedures, but not in adult cohorts undergoing neurosurgical interventions. CONCLUSIONS: VPA use can cause thrombocytopenia and other coagulation abnormalities. Rigorous, prospective trials are needed to better assess the association between valproic acid and clinically significant coagulopathy. Until such data are available, physicians need to be aware of the potential risk of bleeding in patients receiving valproic acid. A hemostatic evaluation should be considered in symptomatic patients, and may be considered for patients taking VPA who are scheduled for surgery. If an abnormality is detected, hematologists should be involved to make recommendation on perioperative hemostatic strategy.
Myoclonus can be classified as physiologic, essential, epileptic, and symptomatic. Animal models of myoclonus include DDT and posthypoxic myoclonus in the rat. 5-Hydrotryptophan, clonazepam, and valproic acid suppress myoclonus induced by posthypoxia. The diagnostic evaluation of myoclonus is complex and involves an extensive work-up including basic electrolytes, glucose, renal and hepatic function tests, paraneoplastic antibodies, drug and toxicology screens, thyroid antibody and function studies, neurophysiology testing, imaging, and tests for malabsorption disorders, assays for enzyme deficiencies, tissue biopsy, copper studies, alpha-fetoprotein, cytogenetic analysis, radiosensitivity DNA synthesis, genetic testing for inherited disorders, and mitochondrial function studies. Treatment of myoclonus is targeted to the underlying disorder. If myoclonus physiology cannot be demonstrated, treatment should be aimed at the common pattern of symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, treatment could be directed empirically at cortical myoclonus as the most common physiology. In cortical myoclonus, the most effective drugs are sodium valproic acid, clonazepam, levetiracetam, and piracetam. For cortical-subcortical myoclonus, valproic acid is the drug of choice. Here, lamotrigine can be used either alone or in combination with valproic acid. Ethosuximide, levetiracetam, or zonisamide can also be used as adjunct therapy with valproic acid. A ketogenic diet can be considered if everything else fails. Subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus may respond to clonazepam and deep-brain stimulation. Rituximab, adrenocorticotropic hormone, high-dose dexamethasone pulse, or plasmapheresis have been reported to improve opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome. Reticular reflex myoclonus can be treated with clonazepam, diazepam and 5-hydrotryptophan. For palatal myoclonus, a variety of drugs have been used.
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has emerged as a powerful technology, with the potential to generate transgenic animals. Particularly, efficient and precise genetic editing with CRISPR/Cas9 offers immense prospects in various biotechnological applications. Here, we report that the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) significantly increases the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in mouse embryonic stem cells and embryos. This effect may be caused through globally enhanced chromatin accessibility, as indicate by histone hyperacetylation. Taken together, our results suggest that VPA can be used to increase the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 in generating transgenic systems.
In patients with hypoalbuminemia, the total serum concentration of valproic acid may offer poor clinical information; however, very few clinical laboratories routinely analyze the free concentration of the drug. The aim of this study was to design a procedure to normalize the total concentration of valproic acid according to the level of serum albumin and using previously published free fraction values. In 121 adult patients, with albumin levels of 18 - 41 g/L, the total concentration of valproic acid was normalized using the derived equation: C(N) = alpha(H)C(H)/6.5, where alpha(H) is the free fraction of the drug corresponding to the patient's particular albuminemia and C(H) is the total concentration of valproic acid. The value of 6.5 corresponds to the free fraction of the drug for a serum albumin of 42 g/L (percentile 50 of the reference range). For total concentrations lower than 75 mg/L, the predicted normalized valproic acid concentrations were reasonably concordant with the observed normalized concentrations calculated using the data from a protein-binding study. In a significant number of cases, subtherapeutic concentrations of the drug became therapeutic and even supratherapeutic when corrected according to the albumin levels. Furthermore, cases with therapeutic drug concentrations frequently became supratherapeutic when normalized. The limitations and clinical applications of the proposed formula for normalizing the total concentration of valproic acid are presented. It is concluded that it may be useful for the posological management of hypoalbuminemic patients when the free concentration of the drug is not available, and decisions have to be made based on the total serum concentration.
