The thyroid axis is particularly prone to interactions with a wide variety of drugs, whose list increases year by year. Hypothyroidism is the most frequent consequence of drug-induced thyroid dysfunction. The main mechanisms involved in the development of primary hypothyroidism are: inhibition of the synthesis and/or release of thyroid hormones, immune mechanisms related to the use of interferon and other cytokines, and the induction of thyroiditis associated with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and drugs blocking the receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor. Central hypothyroidism may be induced by inhibition of thyroid-stimulating hormone (bexarotene or corticosteroids) or by immunological mechanisms (anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1 antibody drugs). It is also important to recognize those drugs that generate hypothyroidism by interaction in its treatment, either by reducing the absorption or by altering the transport and metabolism of levothyroxine. Thus, it is strongly recommended to evaluate thyroid function prior to the prescription of medications such as amiodarone, lithium, or interferon, and the new biological therapies that show important interaction with thyroid and endocrine function in general.
Hundreds of oral and injectable generic drugs have seen dramatic price increases during the 2010s. Several reasons for the astronomic price increases have been postulated, ranging from reduced competition, shortages in the manufacturing supply chain, very small markets, market consolidation, the Unapproved Drugs Initiative of 2006, and unanticipated manufacturing safety issues. In one survey, over 90% of hospital administrators reported that higher drug prices had a moderate or severe impact on their budgets. Whereas compounding pharmacies may present an effective solution to high drug prices, it is a potentially dangerous one, as the case of New England Compounding Center makes clear. The risks make a meticulous vetting process necessary.
While most patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) follow an indolent course, patients with advanced-stage MF/Sezary syndrome (SS) have a poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 5 years. Although there are a number of treatments currently available, achieving and maintaining a durable response remain challenging, especially in advanced-stage MF/SS. The choice of frontline therapy is dependent on the stage of disease. For early-stage MF, the treatment concept is to control skin lesions mainly by skin-directed therapies, such as topical therapies, phototherapies, and radiotherapies. For advanced-stage MF/SS, systemic treatments by biological or targeted therapies including bexarotene and interferon either alone or in combination are tried first, with more immunosuppressive chemotherapies being reserved for refractory or rapidly progressive disease. Recent improvements in biological or targeted therapies include brentuximab vedotin and mogamulizumab. When biopsy samples have 10% or more CD30-positive malignant cells, brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristin E, can be a desirable treatment option. For cases with blood involvement, mogamulizumab, an antibody binding to C-C chemokine receptor 4, is effective with high response rates. In the refractory setting, alemtuzumab, histone deacetylase inhibitors, pralatrexate, gemcitabine, and doxorubicin are considered as the treatment option. Because only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can offer a chance of cure with durable complete remission, advanced-stage patients with a markedly short life expectancy should be evaluated for eligibility. Given that there are few randomized controlled studies in the literature, it is necessary to investigate which therapy is preferable for each patient with MF/SS by comparative prospective trials.
The primary analysis of the phase 3 ALCANZA trial showed significantly improved objective responses lasting >/=4 months (ORR4; primary endpoint) and progression-free survival (PFS) with brentuximab vedotin vs physician's choice (methotrexate or bexarotene) in CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) or primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (C-ALCL). Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas often cause pruritus and pain; brentuximab vedotin improved skin symptom burden with no negative effects on quality of life. We report final data from ALCANZA (median follow-up, 45.9 months). Adults with previously treated CD30-expressing MF/C-ALCL were randomly assigned to brentuximab vedotin (n = 64) or physician's choice (n = 64). Final data demonstrated improved responses per independent review facility with brentuximab vedotin vs physician's choice: ORR4; 54.7% vs 12.5% (P < .001); complete response, 17.2% vs 1.6% (P = .002). Median PFS with brentuximab vedotin vs physician's choice was 16.7 months vs 3.5 months (P < .001). Median time to the next treatment was significantly longer with brentuximab vedotin than with physician's choice (14.2 vs 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.42; P < .001). Of 44 patients in the brentuximab vedotin arm who experienced any-grade peripheral neuropathy, (grade 3, n = 6; grade 4, n = 0), 86% (38 of 44) had complete resolution (26 of 44) or improvement to grades 1 and 2 (12 of 44). Peripheral neuropathy was ongoing in 18 patients (all grades 1-2). These final analyses confirm improved, clinically meaningful, durable responses and longer PFS with brentuximab vedotin vs physician's choice in CD30-expressing MF or C-ALCL. This trial was registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01578499.
The abundance of orally formulated chemotherapy agents reflects the expanding role of oral chemotherapy in the care of patients with cancer. Many oral chemotherapy agents have been used for a number of years, and several have been developed recently. Newer agents include the prodrugs capecitabine and temozolomide, the retinoid bexarotene, the immunomodulatory agent thalidomide, the protein kinase inhibitor imatinib, and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Each agent has unique pharmacologic properties, dosing, and side-effect profiles. This article reviews these agents from a pharmacology perspective.
