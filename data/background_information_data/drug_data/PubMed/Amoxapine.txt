Aim: Amoxapine (AMX) has been reported to be metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Naringin (NG) has been reported to inhibit CYP enzymes. Therefore, the current work was designed to develop AMX solid lipid nanoparticles (AMX-SLNs) and NG-SLNs for better therapeutic performance. Materials & methods: AMX-SLNs and NG-SLNs were prepared and characterized. AMX and NG interactions with CYP450s were studied with molecular docking to rationalize the effectiveness of the combination. Results: AMX-SLNs and NG-SLNs showed nanometric size with a sustained in vitro drug-release profile. NG showed a higher predicted binding affinity for CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, suggesting the potential for inhibition. Conclusion: The developed formulations were thoroughly characterized along with molecular docking data indicating promising AMX and NG combinations that may show good therapeutic activity.
Prolongation of the QRS interval, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death in a 31-year-old woman following an overdose of 2 g amoxapine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is reported. The patient's QRS interval prolonged to beyond 100 ms throughout hospitalization. Thirty-three hours after admission she suffered a bradycardiac-hypotensive event, followed by electromechanical dissociation and subsequent death. Cardiotoxicity has not been directly related to amoxapine; a 2-g acute ingestion is the lowest reported lethal dose.
A GLC analysis is presented for loxapine, amoxapine, and their major metabolites in serum and urine. Electron-capture detection is employed for serum analysis, and flame ionization is used for urine analysis. The procedure includes trifluoroacetylation of secondary amine functions, followed by trimethylsilylation of phenolic groups after ethyl acetate extraction of the sample. Urine requires prior enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugates. Data indicating the utility of the procedure in hospitalized patients and normal volunteers are presented.
Amoxapine, a new antidepressant of the dibenzoxazepine class, was compared with amitriptyline in 80 patients with primary unipolar depressive disorders. In a four-week double-blind trial, the two medications were equally effective and had similar onsets of therapeutic action. The range of side effects was similar, although there was a trend for fewer side effects in the amoxapine group. Serum levels were not related to therapeutic response for either medication.
A selective and sensitive spectrofluorimetric method was developed and validated for the determination of amoxapine in human plasma and urine. The developed method is based on labeling with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (dansyl chloride) and monitoring at 397 nm (excitation)/514 nm (emission). The method was validated for linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy, recovery and robustness. The calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 250-2500 and 50-1250 ng/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. The LOD values were calculated to be 13.31 and 13.17 ng/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. The proposed method was applied to study of amoxapine in human plasma and urine.
A new, selective and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of tricyclic antidepressant drugs, amoxapine and nortriptyline, in human blood plasma and serum, involving their reaction with allyl isothiocyanate and extraction of thiourea derivatives with water-miscible organic solvent acetonitrile. The phase separation was effected by addition of ammonium sulphate, a process called salt-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction. The extract was analyzed by HPLC with UV detection at 254 nm. The method has been optimized for derivatization reaction time and temperature, solvent for extraction, and salt for solvent phase separation. Under the optimal conditions, a linear calibration graph was obtained between the amount of drug and the peak area of thiourea derivatives in the range of 0.002-20 mg/L drugs. The correlation coefficient and limit of detection values for amoxapine and nortriptyline in serum/plasma samples were in the range of 0.9953-0.9999 and 0.46-0.58 mug/L, respectively. The recovery in spiking experiments ranged, respectively, 75-88% (RSD 3.4-7.2%) and 79-97% (RSD 3.7-7.9%) for the two drugs.
The dibenzoxazepine neuroleptic loxapine, its N-demethylated metabolite amoxapine, and their 7- and 8-hydroxymetabolites were measured simultaneously in plasma by reversed-phase high-performance chromatographic method. An original liquid-liquid extraction procedure was performed, consisting in coextraction of the substances together with a water-miscible solvent (acetonitrile) by a non-water-miscible solvent (toluene). The substances were separated on a 5-microm CN 25-cm column, and eluted with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-acetic acid 0.5 N (30:70) and hexylamine (0.05%). They were detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at 310 nm. Clozapine was used as internal standard. Linearity was demonstrated in the range of 10 to 250 microg/l, and detection limits were found to be 3.5 to 6.3 microg/l according to the substance. Within-day repeatability ranged from 2.7% to 6.5%, and between-day reproducibility ranged from 0.9% to 20.2%. The extraction procedure provided a mean absolute recovery of 51.1% (range, 40.7% to 58.6%) with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.2%. This technique was applied to the concurrent determination of plasma concentrations of the compounds in 10 patients administered loxapine 75 to 600 mg daily. Steady state plasma levels of loxapine were significantly correlated with oral doses (n = 10, r = 0.858, p < 0.002). In conclusion, the method proved to be a convenient and reproducible procedure allowing the simultaneous measurement of loxapine, amoxapine, and their metabolites in patients.
Loxapine is an antipsychotic medication used for the treatment of schizophrenia. In vivo, loxapine is metabolized to multiple metabolites. A high performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the determination of loxapine and 4 of its metabolites, loxapine N-oxide, amoxapine (N-desmethyl loxapine), 8-hydroxyloxapine and 7-hydroxyloxapine, in human plasma to support regulated clinical development. During method development, several technical challenges such as poor chromatography, separation of structural isomers, and inadequate sensitivity were met and overcome. The final method utilized micro-elution solid phase extraction (SPE) to extract plasma samples (100muL), and the resulting extracts were analyzed using reversed phase LC-MS/MS using a turbo-ionspray interface in positive ionization mode with selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The method was fully validated according to the current regulatory guidance for bioanalysis over the calibration curve range 0.0500-50.0ng/mL for all analytes using 1/x(2)-weighted linear regression analysis. Based on three separate runs, the between-run precision and inter-day precision for all five analytes at all concentrations, including the LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) quality control at 0.0500ng/mL, varied from 0.0% to 13.8%, while the accuracy ranged from 86.4% to 109.3% of nominal. The extraction recoveries of loxapine and the four metabolites were above 80%. Various forms of short-term and long-term stability were established in both solutions and matrix, including the stability of loxapine and the four metabolites in human plasma for up to 260days of storage at -20 degrees C. This method has been used to support a regulated clinical study, which included the successful execution of incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published methodology in which these five analytes were quantified with a single extraction and injection.
Tonic-clonic seizure activity is a recognized complication of amoxapine overdose. Refractory drug-induced status epilepticus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Standard regimens for controlling status epilepticus may be ineffective for aborting drug-induced seizures. The authors report the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with an amoxapine overdose that deteriorated into status epilepticus refractory to conventional therapy. Propofol given by intravenous bolus and maintenance infusion successfully halted the patient's seizure activity. This case suggests that propofol may be effective as an anticonvulsant in refractory drug-induced status epilepticus.
A method for the identification and quantitation of two tricyclic antidepressants, amoxapine (Asendin) and trimipramine (Surmontil) is presented here. Samples were extracted with hexane at pH 10, back-extracted with 1.0N sulfuric acid. The acidic layer was adjusted to pH 10 and re-extracted with hexane. Electron impact mass spectra were obtained. The base peak and molecular ion for amoxapine were at m/z 245 and 313, respectively. The base peak and molecular ion for trimipramine were at m/z 58 and 294, respectively. There were three forensic toxicology cases involving amoxapine in Cook County, IL, in 1980 and 1981. The concentrations of amoxapine in blood for these three cases were 1.66 mg/L, 7.16 mg/L, and 2.95 mg/L, respectively.
