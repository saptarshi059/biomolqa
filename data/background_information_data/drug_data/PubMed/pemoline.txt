Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most commonly reported symptom in patients with cancer with a prevalence up to 100%. It has a significant negative impact on quality of life. An effective management of CRF could significantly reduce the disease burden associated with cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, the underlying pathophysiology is very complex and not uniform. This article reviews the possible therapy of contributing factors, nonpharmacological treatment, such as exercise and psychosocial interventions, and pharmacologic approaches in managing CRF. Numerous drugs, such as psychostimulants (methylphenidate, dexamphetamines, modafinil and pemoline), antidepressants, corticosteroids, L-carnitine, donepezil and guarana have been studied. Methylphenidate, modafinil and guarana show the most promising results so far. However, additional randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine the benefit of these and other drugs in the treatment of CRF.
This article discusses the use of psychostimulants, such as dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and pemoline, in a variety of illnesses, including depression in the medically ill, cancer, HIV, and AIDS. The chemistry and pharmacology, side effects, drug interactions, dosing, and abuse potential also are reviewed.
We present a case of pemoline-induced autoimmune hepatitis in a 46-yr-old woman who received the drug for management of her multiple sclerosis. The autoimmune nature of the hepatitis is based on elevation of her anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroid antibodies, IgA, and IgM globulins. These features of autoimmunity disappeared with normalization of her liver-associated enzymes and have remained negative for at least 6 months after completion of prednisone therapy.
Treatment of narcolepsy is based on the need to regulate life rhythms. Psychostimulants such as modafinil, methylphenidate-immediate release, and pemoline are used to treat hypersomnia. A psychosocial approach is considered the mainstay of treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and medication is used to treat moderate or severe ADHD symptoms. Two of the four drugs approved in Japan for ADHD therapy (osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) are psychostimulants, which are administered via the ADHD proper distribution management system.
This practice parameter describes treatment with stimulant medication. It uses an evidence-based medicine approach derived from a detailed literature review and expert consultation. Stimulant medications in clinical use include methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, mixed-salts amphetamine, and pemoline. It carries FDA indications for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.
