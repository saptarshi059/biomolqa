Single risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, can combine to exacerbate the development and severity of cardiovascular disease. Treatment goals may be more effectively achieved if multiple disease factors are targeted with combination treatment. We enrolled 202 patients who were randomly divided into the following three groups: telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg, telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg, and telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg. The primary efficacy variables were changes from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) between telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg at 8 weeks, and the percent changes from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg at 8 weeks. The secondary efficacy variables were changes in MSSBP, mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP), LDL cholesterol and other lipid levels at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, as well as observed adverse events during follow-up. There were no significant differences between the three groups in demographic characteristics and no significant difference among the three groups in terms of baseline characteristics for the validity evaluation variables. The mean overall treatment compliance in the three groups was, respectively, 98.42%, 96.68%, and 98.12%, indicating strong compliance for all patients. The Least-Square (LS) mean (SE) for changes in MSSBP in the two (telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg) groups were -19.3 (2.68) mm Hg and -6.69 (2.76) mm Hg. The difference between the two groups was significant (-12.60 (2.77) mm Hg, 95% CI -18.06 to -7.14, P < .0001). The LS Mean for the percent changes from baseline in LDL cholesterol in the two (telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg) groups were -52.45 (3.23) % and 2.68 (3.15) %. The difference between the two groups was significant (-55.13 (3.20) %, 95% CI -61.45 to -48.81, P < .0001). There were no adverse events leading to discontinuation or death. Combined administration of telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg and rosuvastatin 20 mg for the treatment of hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia significantly reduces blood pressure and improves lipid control.

BACKGROUND: Single-pill combinations (SPCs) of three low-dose antihypertensive drugs can improve hypertension control but are not widely available. A key issue for any combination product is the contribution of each component to efficacy and tolerability. This trial compared a new triple SPC called GMRx2, containing telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide, with dual combinations of components for efficacy and safety. METHODS: In this international, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults with hypertension receiving between zero and three antihypertensive drugs, with a screening systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 140-179 mm Hg (on no drugs) to 110-150 mm Hg (on three drugs). Participants were recruited from Australia, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, Sri Lanka, the UK, and the USA. In a 4-week active run-in, existing medications were switched to GMRx2 half dose (telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, and indapamide 1.25 mg). Participants were then randomly allocated (2:1:1:1) to continued GMRx2 half dose or to each possible dual combination of components at half doses (telmisartan 20 mg with amlodipine 2.5 mg, telmisartan 20 mg with indapamide 1.25 mg, or amlodipine 2.5 mg with indapamide 1.25 mg). At week 6, doses were doubled in all groups, unless there was a clinical contraindication. The primary efficacy outcome was mean change in home SBP from baseline to week 12, and the primary safety outcome was withdrawal of treatment due to an adverse event from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy outcomes included differences in clinic and home blood pressure levels and control rates. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04518293, and is completed. FINDINGS: The trial was conducted between July 9, 2021 and Sept 1, 2023. We randomly allocated 1385 participants to four groups: 551 to GMRx2, 276 to telmisartan-indapamide, 282 to telmisartan-amlodipine, and 276 to amlodipine-indapamide groups. The mean age was 59 years (SD 11), 712 (51%) participants self-reported as female and 673 (48.6%) male, and the mean clinic blood pressure at the screening visit was 142/85 mm Hg when taking an average of 1.6 blood pressure medications. Following the run-in on GMRx2 half dose, the mean clinic blood pressure level at randomisation was 133/81 mm Hg and the mean home blood pressure level was 129/78 mm Hg. At week 12, the mean home SBP was 126 mm Hg in the GMRx2 group, which was lower than for each of the dual combinations: -2.5 (95% CI -3.7 to -1.3, p<0.0001) versus telmisartan-indapamide, -5.4 (-6.8 to -4.1, p<0.0001) versus telmisartan-amlodipine, and -4.4 (-5.8 to -3.1, p<0.0001) versus amlodipine-indapamide. For the same comparisons, differences in clinic blood pressure at week 12 were 4.3/3.5 mm Hg, 5.6/3.7 mm Hg, and 6.3/4.5 mm Hg (all p<0.001). Clinic blood pressure control rate below 140/90 mm Hg at week 12 was superior with GMRx2 (74%) to with each dual combination (range 53-61%). Withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 11 (2%) participants in the GMRx2 group, four (1%) in telmisartan-indapamide, three (1%) in telmisartan-amlodipine, and four (1%) in amlodipine-indapamide, with none of the differences being statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: A novel low-dose SPC product of telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide provided clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure reduction compared with dual combinations and was well tolerated. This SPC provides a new therapeutic option for the management of hypertension and its use could result in a substantial improvement in blood pressure control in clinical practice.

Dyslipidemia-hypertension proves to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In order to achieve better adherence and cost-effectiveness than free equivalent combination therapies, a fixed-dose combination therapy with telmisartan (TEL), rosuvastatin calcium (ROS) and amlodipine besylate (AML) is required in this type of patients.
This study aimed to compare and evaluate the efficacy of the blood pressure (BP) control and cholesterol-lowering effects and safety of combination therapy with telmisartan, rosuvastatin, and ezetimibe versus rosuvastatin and ezetimibe double therapy or telmisartan single therapy in dyslipidemia patients with hypertension. After a wash-out/therapeutic lifestyle change period of >/=4 weeks, a total of 100 eligible patients were randomized and received one of three treatments for 8 weeks: (1) telmisartan 80 mg/rosuvastatin 20 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg (TRE), (2) rosuvastatin 20 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg (RE), or (3) telmisartan 80 mg (T). The primary endpoint was the efficacy evaluation of TRE by comparing changes in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) and mean percentage change in low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment. The least square (LS) mean (SE) changes in msSBP at 8 weeks compared with baseline were -23.02 (3.04) versus -7.18 (3.09) mmHg in the TRE and RE groups, respectively (p < .0001), and -25.80 (2.74) versus -14.92 (2.65) mmHg in the TRE and T groups, respectively (p = .0005). The percentage changes in the mean (SD) LDL-C at 8 weeks compared with baseline were -54.97% (3.49%) versus -0.17% (3.23%) in the TRE and T groups, respectively (p < .0001). No serious adverse events occurred, and no statistically significant differences in the incidence of overall AEs and adverse drug reactions occurred among the three groups. TRE therapy significantly decreased msSBP and LDL-C compared to RE or T therapy with comparable safety and tolerability profiles.
Cerebral ischemic stroke causes substantial white matter injury, which is further aggravated by neuroinflammation mediated by microglia/astrocytes. Given the anti-neuroinflammatory action of telmisartan and the enhancing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability potential of resuscitation-inducing aromatic herbs, 13 hybrids (3a-m) of telmisartan (or its simplified analogues) with resuscitation-inducing aromatic agents were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Among them, the optimal compound 3a (the ester hybrid of telmisartan and (+)-borneol) potently inhibited neuroinflammation mediated by microglia/astrocytes and ameliorated ischemic stroke. Particularly, 3a significantly conferred protection for white matter integrity after cerebral ischemic stroke via decreasing abnormally dephosphorylated neurofilament protein, upregulating myelin basic protein, and attenuating oligodendrocyte damage. Further RNA-sequencing data revealed that 3a upregulated expression of transcriptional regulator ATF3 to reduce the expression of CH25H, prevented proinflammatory state of lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia/astrocytes to limit excessive inflammation, and eventually protected neighboring oligodendrocytes to prevent white matter injury. Taken with the desirable pharmacokinetics behavior and improved brain distribution, 3a may be a feasible therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders with white matter injury.
Fetal and neonatal toxic effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists have been described in animals and humans. Five cases of fetal or neonatal deaths have been reported following maternal use of sartans for hypertension. We report a case of neonatal transient renal failure following telmisartan therapy during pregnancy. This class of antihypertensive drugs should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Telmisartan is an antagonist of the angiotensin II receptor used in the management of hypertension (alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It belongs to the drug class of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Among drugs of this class, telmisartan shows particular pharmacologic properties, including a longer half-life than any other angiotensin II receptor blockers that bring higher and persistent antihypertensive activity. In hypertensive patients, telmisartan has superior efficacy than other antihypertensive drugs (losartan, valsartan, ramipril, atenolol, and perindopril) in controlling blood pressure, especially towards the end of the dosing interval. Telmisartan has a partial PPARgamma-agonistic effect whilst does not have the safety concerns of full agonists of PPARgamma receptors (thiazolidinediones). Moreover, telmisartan has an agonist activity on PPARalpha and PPARdelta receptors and modulates the adipokine levels. Thus, telmisartan could be considered as a suitable alternative option, with multi-benefit for all components of metabolic syndrome including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. This review will highlight the role of telmisartan in metabolic syndrome and the main mechanisms of action of telmisartan are discussed and summarized. Many studies have demonstrated the useful properties of telmisartan in the prevention and improving of metabolic syndrome and this well-tolerated drug can be greatly proposed in the treatment of different components of metabolic syndrome. However, larger and long-duration studies are needed to confirm these findings in long-term observational studies and prospective trials and to determine the optimum dose of telmisartan in metabolic syndrome.
For the quantifiable amounts of Telmisartan (TLM) and Hydrochlorothiazide (HYD) in the presence of Amlodipine (AML) in a ternary mixture of synthetic laboratory mixture, a novel, sensitive, quick, and practical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was given. In order to separate, a Waters Spherisorb ODS-2 C18 column was used. For HYD, TLM, and AML, these techniques were viable over linearity ranges of 4-12 mug/mL, 4-25 mug/mL, and 5-40 mug/mL, respectively. The mobile phase system was acetonitrile:methanol: phosphate buffer at pH 2.5 (65:5:30 v/v/v), and the flow rate was 1.5 mL/min. Novel spectrophotometric methods were applied for active substances to determine simultaneously. The first method is absorptivity centering using factorized spectrum, and the second method is dual amplitude difference coupled with absorbance subtraction. These approaches have been effectively applied to bulk, laboratory synthetic mixtures to employ active components quantitatively. Correlation coefficients were found to be higher than 0.99 and the limit of detection values lower than 0.49 mug/mL in both spectrophotometric methods. The methodologies were validated following ICH recommendations. In the developed HPLC method, the limit of detection values was found to be 0.01 mug/mL for HYD and 0.02 mug/mL for AML and TLM. The correlation coefficients for the HPLC method were found to be 0.9971 for HYD, 0.9990 for AML, and 0.9983 for TLM. The suggested HPLC technique is a simple, effective, sensitive, environmentally friendly, and time-saving approach for determining TLM and HYD in the presence of AML.
AIM: The present study compared the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of telmisartan 40 mg + bisoprolol 5 mg (TBP) tablets with the existing comparator FDC telmisartan 40 mg + metoprolol succinate ER 50 mg (TMS) tablets in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension. METHODOLOGY: The multicentric, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative, prospective, phase-III clinical study involved 264 subjects with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension from 10 centres across India. The selected subjects were randomized into two groups: group A received the TMS and group B received the new FDC TBP. The primary endpoint was the mean change in seated systolic blood pressure (SeSBP) and seated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) from baseline to week 12 in both the control and study arms. The secondary endpoint was achieving the target of SeSBP <140 mmHg and SeDBP <90 mmHg from baseline to week 12 in both groups. Safety and tolerability parameters were evaluated in both groups based on adverse effects (AEs) reported by the patients and the physician. RESULTS: Both treatment groups exhibited a reduction in BP after 2 weeks of treatment, which was sustained until 12 weeks. The mean change in SeSBP and SeDBP at weeks 2, 6, and 12 compared to the previous visit showed statistical significance (p < 0.001) in all cases for both groups A and B. The mean changes in SeSBP and SeDBP from baseline to study end were numerically higher in group B than in group A. The mean difference in SeSBP from baseline to study end was significantly higher in group B compared to group A (p = 0.029). By week 12, 88.28 % and 89.84 % of subjects in group B achieved SeSBP <140 mmHg and SeDBP <90 mmHg respectively, while 86.71 % and 91.40 % of subjects in group A achieved the same targets. Reported AEs were mostly mild to moderate in both treatment groups, and no serious AEs or deaths were reported. Tolerability was rated as 'excellent' by 93.75 % of subjects in group B and 91.40 % of subjects in group A. CONCLUSION: Both the new FDC TBP and the existing comparator TMS combination therapy have comparable efficacy, tolerability, and safety for the management of stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension.

Angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to provide stroke, cardiac and renal protection in high-risk hypertensive patients. Telmisartan is a powerful and selective ARB that provides sustained blood pressure reduction for a full 24 h after a single dose and continues to protect against circadian blood pressure surges in the critical early morning hours. The objective of the Programme of Research tO show Telmisartan End-organ proteCTION (PROTECTION) is to measure the end-organ protective effects of telmisartan in patients at high risk of renal, cardiac and vascular damage. An extensive series of clinical trials is being conducted to compare telmisartan with valsartan, losartan, amlodipine and ramipril in patients at increased risk of end-organ damage. Nine clinical studies will examine the effects of telmisartan in about 5000 hypertensive patients with isolated systolic hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy or renal disease. All of the studies will be conducted using state-of-the-art technology, including such techniques as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and magnetic resonance imaging. This programme will also investigate the effects of an ARB on key surrogate markers of organ tissue damage. This series of trials will characterize the end-organ protective effects of telmisartan in hypertensive patient populations at high risk of clinical events.
Observational studies suggest a reduction in fatal or severe COVID-19 disease with the use of ACE2 inhibitors and statins. We implemented a randomized controlled tree-arm open label trial evaluating the benefits of adding telmisartan (TLM) or atorvastatin (ATV) to lopinavir boosted ritonavir (LPVr) on the SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal viral load in patients with mild / moderate COVID-19 infection in Cote d'Ivoire. RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients >/= 18 years, with general or respiratory symptoms for less than 7 days were randomized (1:1:1) to receive LPVr (400 mg/100 mg twice daily), LPVr + TLM (10 mg once daily) or LPVr + ATV (20 mg once daily) for 10 days. The primary endpoint was viro-inflammatory success defined as a composite variable at day 11: Ct >/= 40 and C-reactive protein < 27 mg/L. We randomized 294 patients: 96 to LPVr, 100 to LPVr + TLM, 98 to LPVr + ATV arms. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between arms. In the primary analysis (missing = failure), 46% patients in the LPVr arm reached viro-inflammatory success at day 11 vs 43% in the LPVr + TLM arm (p = 0.69) and 43% in the LPVr + ATV arm (p = 0.68). The median time from baseline to resolution of COVID-19 related symptoms was not different between arms. Nine patients were hospitalized: 2 in the LPVr arm, 5 in the LPVr + TLM arm and 2 in the LPVr + ATV arm and 4 patients died. Among adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection, the addition of telmisartan or atorvastatin, to the standard LPVr treatment is not associated with a better virological or clinical outcome.Trial registration: NCT04466241, registered on 10/07/2020.
There is a lack of studies comparing the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular disease between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) of different half-lives. We aimed to compare the risks of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and cerebrovascular disease with the use of valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan with different half-lives in a national claim-based retrospective cohort of patients aged >/= 40 years with hypertension. To establish a cohort exposed to valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, or telmisartan, we performed propensity score (PS) matching and used an as-treated approach to evaluate exposure. The Cox regression model was employed to calculate hazard ratios, which were based on the incidence rate for each newly occurring event of MI, heart failure, or cerebrovascular disease. These hazard ratios were calculated to compare the risk of MI, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease associated with valsartan, losartan, and irbesartan in comparison to telmisartan. A PS-matched cohort of 148,229 patients was established for each of valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, or telmisartan. The matched cohort analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratio (aHRs, 95% confidence interval) for MI was higher for valsartan use (1.39, 1.33-1.45) and losartan use (1.10, 1.05-1.15) but lower for irbesartan use (0.90, 0.86-0.94) compared with the reference (telmisartan). The aHRs for HF were not different among these ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers). The aHR for cerebrovascular disease was lower for valsartan use (0.85, 0.83-0.87) and losartan use (0.80, 0.78-0.82) but higher for irbesartan use (1.11, 1.09-1.13) compared with the reference. We found differences in the risk of MI and cerebrovascular disease with the use of different ARBs compared to telmisartan use. Valsartan, and losartan with a short half-life, which showed a higher risk of MI, had a lower risk of cerebrovascular disease. Conversely, irbesartan with a long half-life, which showed a lower risk of MI, had a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease.
