Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions. The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. In this article, we review the prognosis and response to onychomycosis treatment, medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and off-label therapies and devices. Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and emerging therapies are also described.
Approximately 70-75% of women will have vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC) at least once in their lifetime. In premenopausal, pregnant, asymptomatic and healthy women and women with acute VVC, Candida albicans is the predominant species. The diagnosis of VVC should be based on clinical symptoms and microscopic detection of pseudohyphae. Symptoms alone do not allow reliable differentiation of the causes of vaginitis. In recurrent or complicated cases, diagnostics should involve fungal culture with species identification. Serological determination of antibody titres has no role in VVC. Before the induction of therapy, VVC should always be medically confirmed. Acute VVC can be treated with local imidazoles, polyenes or ciclopirox olamine, using vaginal tablets, ovules or creams. Triazoles can also be prescribed orally, together with antifungal creams, for the treatment of the vulva. Commonly available antimycotics are generally well tolerated, and the different regimens show similarly good results. Antiseptics are potentially effective but act against the physiological vaginal flora. Neither a woman with asymptomatic colonisation nor an asymptomatic sexual partner should be treated. Women with chronic recurrent Candida albicans vulvovaginitis should undergo dose-reducing maintenance therapy with oral triazoles. Unnecessary antimycotic therapies should always be avoided, and non-albicans vaginitis should be treated with alternative antifungal agents. In the last 6 weeks of pregnancy, women should receive antifungal treatment to reduce the risk of vertical transmission, oral thrush and diaper dermatitis of the newborn. Local treatment is preferred during pregnancy.
Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail, causing discoloration and thickening of the affected nail plate, and is the most common nail infection worldwide. Onychomycosis was initially thought to be predominantly caused by dermatophytes; however, new research has revealed that mixed infections and those caused by non-dermatophyte moulds (NDMs) are more prevalent than previously thought, especially in warmer climates. Microscopy and fungal culture are the gold standard techniques for onychomycosis diagnosis, but high false-negative rates have pushed for more accurate methods, such as histology and PCR. As NDMs are skin and laboratory contaminants, their presence as an infectious agent requires multiple confirmations and repeated sampling. There are several treatment options available, including oral antifungals, topicals and devices. Oral antifungals have higher cure rates and shorter treatment periods than topical treatments, but have adverse side effects such as hepatotoxicity and drug interactions. Terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole are most commonly used, with new oral antifungals such as fosravuconazole being evaluated. Topical treatments, such as efinaconazole, tavaborole, ciclopirox and amorolfine have less serious side effects, but also have generally lower cure rates and much longer treatment regimens. New topical formulations are being investigated as faster-acting alternatives to the currently available topical treatments. Devices such as lasers have shown promise in improving the cosmetic appearance of the nail, but due to a high variation of study methods and definitions of cure, their effectiveness for onychomycosis has yet to be sufficiently proven. Recurrence rates for onychomycosis are high; once infected, patients should seek medical treatment as soon as possible and sanitize their shoes and socks. Prophylactic application of topicals and avoiding walking barefoot in public places may help prevent recurrence.
INTRODUCTION: Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects a variable proportion of the general population, ranging from 3% to 10%. Malassezia yeast species (previously referred to as Pityrosporum) are thought to be the responsible organisms, and cause inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, ciclopirox, ketoconazole, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).
Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails that causes discoloration, thickening, and separation from the nail bed. Onychomycosis occurs in 10% of the general population, 20% of persons older than 60 years, and 50% of those older than 70 years. It is caused by a variety of organisms, but most cases are caused by dermatophytes. Accurate diagnosis involves physical and microscopic examination and culture. Histologic evaluation using periodic acid-Schiff staining increases sensitivity for detecting infection. Treatment is aimed at eradication of the causative organism and return to a normal appearance of the nail. Systemic antifungals are the most effective treatment, with meta-analyses showing mycotic cure rates of 76% for terbinafine, 63% for itraconazole with pulse dosing, 59% for itraconazole with continuous dosing, and 48% for fluconazole. Concomitant nail debridement further increases cure rates. Topical therapy with ciclopirox is less effective; it has a failure rate exceeding 60%. Several nonprescription treatments have also been evaluated. Laser and photodynamic therapies show promise based on in-vitro evaluation, but more clinical studies are needed. Despite treatment, the recurrence rate of onychomycosis is 10% to 50% as a result of reinfection or lack of mycotic cure.
