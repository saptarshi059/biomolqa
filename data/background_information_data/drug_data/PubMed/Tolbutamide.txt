The sulfonylureas remain the most important oral agents, although their chronic hypoglycemic actions are still unexplained and the evidence on their relative efficacy is inconclusive. Data on relative safety suggest that chlorpropamide is the most toxic sulfonylurea but glyburide causes dangerous hypoglycemia as often as chlorpropamide. For many patients, good blood glucose control will be achieved by taking tolbutamide or another sulfonylurea 30 minutes before breakfast and the main evening meal. The biguanide metformin, which is as safe as glyburide, is of use in treating overweight diabetic patients who do not have cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal dysfunction.
Many dermatologists have reported that insulin and tolbutamide are therapeutically effective in acne. This rationalizes a recent observation that high-chromium yeast appears to have value as an acne treatment.
The effect of the oral sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic drugs may be influenced by a large number of other drugs. Some of these combinations (e.g. phenylbutazone, sulphaphenazole) may result in cases of severe hypoglycaemic collapse. Tolbutamide and chlorpropamide should never be given to a patient without a prior careful check of which medicaments are already being given. Similarly, no drug should be given to a diabetic treated with tolbutamide and chlorpropamide without consideration of the possibility of interaction phenomena.
A 67-year-old female diabetic is presented who developed a Coombs'-positive hemolytic anemia after a year of treatment with tolbutamide. An IgG antibody was identified in the patient's serum that caused the agglutination of both the patient's red blood cells and tolbutamide-coated erythrocytes in the absence of complement. Such a reaction did not occur with the patient's erythrocytes when not exposed to tolbutamide. Agglutination of the patient's serum also occurred with erythrocytes treated with other sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, carbutamide) but not with phenacetin.
If the dose of insulin and adequate carbohydrate intake is ensured, most diabetic mothers taking insulin will be able to breastfeed satisfactorily. Compared to the dose before pregnancy, the required insulin dose probably will be substantially reduced during breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends tolbutamide as the preferred oral hypoglycemic agent during the breastfeeding period; however, the infant should be monitored closely for signs of jaundice. The mother should be monitored using a method specific for glucose, since lacturia may interfere with nonspecific methods of urine glucose measurement. It is important to monitor for ketones in the mother because acetone is excreted in breastmilk and may adversely affect the infant's liver.
