Acute diarrhea is a common reason for non-wellness veterinary visits in dogs. Treatment for acute diarrhea usually consists of supportive care with nutritional intervention, fluid therapy, anthelmintics, and often an antibiotic - commonly metronidazole in North America. The empirical use of metronidazole for acute diarrhea in dogs has been a common practice in veterinary medicine for many decades; however, recent studies evaluating its use suggest it may be inappropriately utilized in many cases. Herein, we review the evidence evaluating the use of metronidazole and other antibiotics in acute diarrhea in the human and veterinary literature. Recommendations on the use of metronidazole and other antibiotics as well as other therapeutic considerations in the treatment of acute diarrhea are also provided.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metronidazole, a commonly used antibiotic drug, can cause adverse effects in the central nervous system termed metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, leading to diagnostic challenges. The condition is rare and a detailed description of its phenotype is lacking. In this systematic review we investigated the clinical features of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy to promote recognition and elaborate the description. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed.gov and hand searched the reference lists of included articles and other publications of interest. We included case series and single reports describing individual patients developing symptoms from the central nervous system in relation to metronidazole treatment. Data were extracted and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: We identified 779 publications of which 112 papers comprising 136 patients were included. Typical findings were dysarthria, gait instability, limb dyscoordination and altered mental status. Frequently, patients concomitantly presented with metronidazole-induced polyneuropathy. Liver disease was the most common pre-existing condition. MRI showed a characteristic pattern of reversible symmetrical hyperintense lesions on T2/FLAIR of the dentate nuclei in 90% of patients. Most patients improved significantly after discontinuation of metronidazole. Poor outcome was associated with severe comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy should be considered in patients presenting with neurological symptoms in relation to newly initiated or prolonged metronidazole treatment. MRI changes are highly characteristic and specific. Patients with liver disease are at increased risk. Prognosis is good if recognized early.
OBJECTIVE: Metronidazole is an antibiotic widely used in different medical conditions such as trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, and giardiasis among others. Its use has been associated with toxicity; however, it is not well characterized. In this review, we discuss the different therapeutic uses of metronidazole and its side effects in order to aid future investigation in this field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant information, original research articles, clinical trials, and reviews were collected from PubMed to know the state of the art of the different therapeutic uses of metronidazole and the reported side effects. RESULTS: Metronidazole was used by the first time in 1959, to treat an infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis; subsequently, new therapeutic properties were discovered. Nowadays, Metronidazole is used to treat infections caused by Bacteroides, Fusobacteria and Clostridia, rosacea, oral and dental infections, bone and joint infections, gynecologic infections, endocarditis, septicemia, and respiratory tract infections. It also can be used to treat Crohn s disease or even like prophylaxis, before surgical procedures. Metronidazole is well tolerated with mild to moderate side effects such as nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Nevertheless, serious neurotoxicity, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and encephalopathy have been reported in rare cases. Their genotoxic effects observed in animal models are controversial in humans. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic use of metronidazole had increased worldwide. Even though it is widely used, metronidazole has been associated with neurotoxicity and genotoxicity; however, its side effects are not well established. Conversely, its veterinary use is restricted in some countries because of its tumor association. Subsequently, further studies are needed to discover the secure use of metronidazole and describe new usages for this drug.
Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole, remains a front-line choice for treatment of infections related to inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract including colitis linked to Clostridium difficile. Despite >60 years of research, the metabolism of metronidazole and associated cytotoxicity is not definitively characterized. Nitroimidazoles are prodrugs that are reductively activated (the nitro group is reduced) under low oxygen tension, leading to imidazole fragmentation and cytotoxicity. It remains unclear if nitroimidazole reduction (activation) contributes to the cytotoxicity profile, or whether subsequent fragmentation of the imidazole ring and formed metabolites alone mediate cytotoxicity. A molecular mechanism underpinning high level (>256 mg/L) bacterial resistance to metronidazole also remains elusive. Considering the widespread use of metronidazole and other nitroimidazoles, this review was undertaken to emphasize the structure-cytotoxicity profile of the numerous metabolites of metronidazole in human and murine models and to examine conflicting reports regarding metabolite-DNA interactions. An alternative hypothesis, that DNA synthesis and repair of existing DNA is indirectly inhibited by metronidazole is proposed. Prokaryotic metabolism of metronidazole is detailed to discuss new resistance mechanisms. Additionally, the review contextualizes the history and current use of metronidazole, rates of metronidazole resistance including metronidazole MDR as well as the biosynthesis of azomycin, the natural precursor of metronidazole. Changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome and the host after metronidazole administration are also reviewed. Finally, novel nitroimidazoles and new antibiotic strategies are discussed.
Metronidazole, the prototype nitroimidazole antimicrobial, was originally introduced to treat Trichomonas vaginalis, but is now used for the treatment of anaerobic and protozoal infections. The nitroimidazoles are bactericidal through toxic metabolites which cause DNA strand breakage. Resistance, both clinical and microbiological, has been described only rarely. Metronidazole given orally is absorbed almost completely, with bioavailability > 90% for tablets; absorption is unaffected by infection. Rectal and intravaginal absorption are 67 to 82%, and 20 to 56%, of the dose, respectively. Metronidazole is distributed widely and has low protein binding (< 20%). The volume of distribution at steady state in adults is 0.51 to 1.1 L/kg. Metronidazole reaches 60 to 100% of plasma concentrations in most tissues studied, including the central nervous system, but does not reach high concentrations in placental tissue. Metronidazole is extensively metabolised by the liver to 5 metabolites. The hydroxy metabolite has biological activity of 30 to 65% and a longer elimination half-life than the parent compound. The majority of metronidazole and its metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces, with less than 12% excreted unchanged in urine. The pharmacokinetics of metronidazole are unaffected by acute or chronic renal failure, haemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, age, pregnancy or enteric disease. Renal dysfunction reduces the elimination of metronidazole metabolites; however, no toxicity has been documented and dosage alterations are unnecessary. Liver disease leads to a decreased clearance of metronidazole and dosage reduction is recommended. Recent pharmacodynamic studies of metronidazole have demonstrated activity for 12 to 24 hours after administration of metronidazole 1 g. The post-antibiotic effect of metronidazole extends beyond 3 hours after the concentration falls below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, prolonged half-life and sustained activity in plasma support the clinical evaluation of higher doses of metronidazole given less frequently. Metronidazole-containing regimens for Helicobacter pylori in combination with proton pump inhibitors demonstrate higher success rates than antimicrobial regimens alone. The pharmacokinetics of metronidazole in gastric fluid appear contradictory to these results, since omeprazole reduces peak drug concentration and area under the concentration-time curve for metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite; however, concentrations remain above the MIC. Other members of this class include tinidazole, ornidazole and secnidazole. They are also well absorbed and distributed after oral administration. Their only distinguishing features are prolonged half-lives compared with metronidazole. The choice of nitroimidazole may be influenced by the longer administration intervals possible with other members of this class; however, metronidazole remains the predominant antimicrobial for anaerobic and protozoal infections.
