Arterial hypertension is a highly manageable disorder due to a variety of drugs available for its treatment. Since the late 1990s, angiotensin II receptor blockers have been widely prescribed, achieving appropriate control in patients' blood pressure. Few cases of serious adverse effects have been reported to date. Here, we present a case of acute hepatocellular injury secondary to candesartan administration. Further studies should be performed in patients who present with this adverse effect, in order to prevent more serious outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Half of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), but few treatments have specifically been assessed in such patients. In previous studies of patients with CHF and low LVEF or vascular disease and preserved LVEF, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is beneficial. We investigated the effect of addition of an angiotensin-receptor blocker to current treatments. METHODS: Between March, 1999, and July, 2000, we randomly assigned 3023 patients candesartan (n=1514, target dose 32 mg once daily) or matching placebo (n=1509). Patients had New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and LVEF higher than 40%. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Median follow-up was 36.6 months. 333 (22%) patients in the candesartan and 366 (24%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.77-1.03], p=0.118; covariate adjusted 0.86 [0.74-1.0], p=0.051). Cardiovascular death did not differ between groups (170 vs 170), but fewer patients in the candesartan group than in the placebo group were admitted to hospital for CHF once (230 vs 279, p=0.017) or multiple times. Composite outcomes that included non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke showed similar results to the primary composite (388 vs 429; unadjusted 0.88 [0.77-1.01], p=0.078; covariate adjusted 0.86 [0.75-0.99], p=0.037). INTERPRETATION: Candesartan has a moderate impact in preventing admissions for CHF among patients who have heart failure and LVEF higher than 40%.
Chen et al. show that candesartan (Cand) displays an antioxidant action independent of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade that translates into a superior renoprotection of chronic renal inflammation. The peculiarity of Cand in combining AT1R-blocking activity and an antioxidant action could have important theoretical implications for therapy.
INTRODUCTION: "Amlodipine/valsartan" or "amlodipine/candesartan" combinations represent two effective antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action. Nevertheless, a study has yet to be done to evaluate the effect of amlodipine/candesartan on central blood pressure and compare it with amlodipine/valsartan combination. To see how "amlodipine plus candesartan combination" reduces peripheral and central blood pressure compared to the most studied combination, "amlodipine plus valsartan". MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients were randomized in an open-label, prospective study by 1:1 ratio to two groups. Group I (n=42) received the amlodipine and valsartan combination, and group II (n=44) received the amlodipine and candesartan combination. Peripheral and central blood pressure (CBP) was measured at baseline, at 6 and 12 weeks of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Both treatment groups reduced peripheral systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure. There was no significant difference between and within both groups. The amlodipine/candesartan combination showed more reduction in peripheral systolic blood pressure (PSBP) after 12 weeks of treatment (p=<0.001). Both groups decreased CBP without significant differences between groups. The amlodipine/candesartan combination showed additional efficacy in decreasing CSBP after 12 weeks (p=<0.001). The two treatment groups did not exert significant efficacy in lowering heart rate (HR) and augmentation index% (AIx%). CONCLUSION: To conclude, the amlodipine 10mg/candesartan 16mg combination was non-inferior to the amlodipine 10mg/valsartan 160mg combination in terms of reducing peripheral and CBP over time.
INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness of candesartan in migraine prevention is supported by two randomized controlled trials. We aimed to assess the effectiveness, tolerability, and response predictors of candesartan in the preventive treatment of migraine. METHODS: Observational, multicenter, prospective cohort study. The 50%, 75% and 30% responder rates, between weeks 8-12 and 20-24, were compared with the baseline. Treatment emergent adverse effects were systematically evaluated. Response predictors were estimated by multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were included, 79.1% females, aged 39.5 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 26.3-50.3), with chronic migraine (43.0%), medication overuse headache (55.8%) and a median of two (inter-quartile range: 0.75-3) prior preventive treatments. At baseline patients had 14 (10-24) headache and 8 (5-11) migraine days per month. The 30%, 50% and 75% responder rates were 40%, 34.9% and 15.1% between weeks 8-12, and 48.8%, 36%, and 18.6% between weeks 20-24. Adverse effects were reported by 30 (34.9%) and 13 (15.1%) patients between weeks 0-12 and 12-24, leading to discontinuation in 15 (17.4%) patients. Chronic migraine, depression, headache days per month, medication overuse headache, and daily headache at baseline predicted the response between weeks 20-24. CONCLUSION: Candesartan effectiveness and tolerability in migraine prevention was in line with the clinical trials' efficacy.Trial registration: The study protocol is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04138316).
Candesartan cilexetil is a nonpeptide selective blocker of the angiotensin II receptor sub-type 1. It is a prodrug that is converted to its active metabolite during its variable absorption. It is highly protein bound with a small volume of distribution and a nine-hour half-life. Candesartan is one of two angiotensin receptor blockers approved for use in heart failure. MEDLINE was searched using OVID and PubMed to evaluate the evidence for using candesartan in patients with heart failure. Pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic evaluations, as well as clinical trials, were selected and are presented in this review. Clinical evidence supports the indication for use in systolic heart failure. Results for use in patients with diastolic heart failure were non-significant. Candesartan was well tolerated in the trials, with hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and hypotension being the most common adverse events. Use of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors needs further study; however, candesartan appears to provide added benefit in this setting. Candesartan is a safe and effective option for patients with systolic heart failure. Data regarding other angiotensin receptor blockers is underway.
BACKGROUND: Candesartan is a relatively novel antihypertensive agent of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Several clinical trials have compared candesartan with losartan in the management of essential hypertension. However, systematic assessment of efficacy and safety between candesartan and losartan is still lacking. METHODS: We reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing candesartan with losartan for net reduction in blood pressure from baseline, response and control rates, and incidences of common and serious adverse events.Weighted mean differences (WMD), and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs with 3644 patients were included in this meta-analysis. When comparing the efficacy of candesartan and losartan in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the end of the follow-up period, results with candesartan were superior to losartan in the reduction SBP and DBP (WMD, -2.97; 95% CI, -4.18 - -1.77; p < 0.001; WMD, -1.76; 95% CI, -2.57 - -0.96; p < 0.001; respectively). Candesartan had better response and control rates than losartan. (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.18; p < 0.01; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06-1.50; p = 0.008). Reported common adverse events for the two agents were not significantly different (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.86-1.12; p = 0.78). The incidence of serious adverse events for candesartan was lower than for losartan (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92; p = 0.03). The net reduction of DBP showed negative correlation with baseline DBP in both candesartan and losartan groups (regression coefficient -1.81, p = 0.03 and regression coefficient -1.56, p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Candesartan is superior to losartan in reducing blood pressure. Candesartan also causes fewer serious adverse events than losartan.
The poor aqueous solubility of irbesartan (IRB) and candesartan cilexetil (CAC) may hamper their bioavailability when orally or topically administered. Among several attempts, the promising nanoaggregate formation by gamma-cyclodextrin (gammaCD) complexation of drugs in aqueous solution with or without water-soluble polymers was investigated. According to phase solubility studies, Soluplus(R) showed the highest complexation efficiency (CE) of drug/gammaCD complexes among the polymers tested. The aqueous solubility of IRB and CAC was markedly increased as a function of Soluplus((R)) concentrations. The binary drug/gammaCD and ternary drug/gammaCD/Soluplus((R)) complex formations were supported and confirmed by solid-state characterizations, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The true inclusion mode was also proved by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy. The nanoaggregate size and morphology of binary and ternary systems were observed using dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The size of these nanocarriers depends on the concentration of Soluplus((R)). The use of Soluplus((R)) could significantly enhance drug solubility and stabilize complex nanoaggregates, which could be a prospective platform for drug delivery systems.
AIM: To evaluate the impact of AGTR1 A1166C (rs5186) on the response to candesartan in patients with heart failure. MATERIALS & METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, open-label study. We studied 299 symptomatic patients with heart failure presenting a left ventricular ejection fraction </=40%. RESULTS: Reductions in the primary end points of natriuretic peptides were not significantly associated with AGTR1 A1166C. Nevertheless, carrying the 1166C allele was associated with a greater compensatory increase in renin activity (p = 0.037) after 16 weeks of treatment with candesartan and a more modest effect on aldosterone concentrations (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: AGTR1 1166C carriers may experience a greater long-term compensatory renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation following treatment with candesartan. Whether these associations ultimately influence clinical outcomes requires investigation. Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT00400582.
Candesartan cilexetil is the prodrug of candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. Absorbed candesartan cilexetil is completely metabolised to candesartan. Oral bioavailability is low (about 40%) because of incomplete absorption. Plasma protein binding in humans is more than 99%. The volume of distribution in healthy individuals is 0.13 L/kg. CV-15959 is the inactive metabolite of candesartan. Candesartan that reaches the systemic circulation is mainly cleared by the kidneys, and to a smaller extent by the biliary or intestinal route. The apparent oral clearance of candesartan is 0.25 L/h/kg after a single dose in healthy individuals. Oral clearance (3.4 to 28.4 L/h) is highly variable among patients. No relevant pharmacokinetic drug-food or drug-drug interactions are known. The terminal elimination half-life remains unclear, but appears to be longer than the currently used range of 4 to 9 hours. Non-compartmental models do not appear to be appropriate for the analysis of candesartan pharmacokinetic data. A 2-compartment analysis revealed a much longer half-life of 29 hours using data from patients with hypertension. However, a further indepth analysis has never been performed. The concentration-effect relationship is unaffected by age. No gender or race differences have been shown in the effect or pharmacokinetics of candesartan. Renal function affects the pharmacokinetic profile of candesartan. For patients with creatinine clearances of >60 ml/min x 1.73m(2), 30 to 60 ml/min x 1.73m(2) and 15 to 30 ml/min x 1.73m(2), the elimination half-life is 7.1, 10.0 and 15.7 hours, respectively, at a dose of 8 mg/day. However, at 12 mg/day an accumulation factor of 1.71 was found. Thus, a maximum daily dose of up to 8mg appears suitable in patients with severe renal dysfunction. No significant elimination of candesartan occurs with haemodialysis. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no relevant pharmacokinetic alterations have been observed. Dosages of up to 12 mg/day do not require precautions in patients with mild to moderate liver disease. Clinically effective dosages range between 8 and 32 mg/day. The response rate of monotherapy with candesartan in patients with hypertension increases with dosage, but never exceeds 60% at a daily dosage of 16mg of candesartan. Dosages up to 32 mg/day do not increase this response rate.
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. The SCOPE clinical trial assessed the effects of the angiotensin Type 1 (AT(1))-receptor antagonist, candesartan, on major cardiovascular events in elderly hypertensive patients. A first major cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) occurred to a lesser extent in the candesartan group (242 of 2477) than the placebo group (268 of 2460) and this difference represented a reduction in stroke rather than cardiac events. The ACCESS trial was designed to assess the safety of a modest blood pressure reduction with the AT 1 -receptor antagonist, candesartan, in the early treatment of stroke. What ACCESS actually showed was that, in the absence of blood pressure lowering, candesartan treatment for 7 days, started within 24 h of motor deficit associated with stoke, reduced the cumulative 12-month mortality rate (7.2 and 2.9% for placebo and candesartan, respectively) and vascular events (18.7 and 9.8% for placebo and candesartan, respectively). In conclusion, candesartan is safe to use in the prevention and treatment of acute stroke, and may provide therapeutic benefits.
Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen that has developed extensive virulence factors which allows successful colonization and infection of the host. Anti-virulence agents can alleviate the pathogenesis of fungi and help the immune system to eradicate them easily. This study aimed to explore the anti-virulence effect of domperidone and candesartan against C. albicans standard strain. Sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4 and 1/8 of minimum inhibitory concentration) of domperidone and candesartan significantly inhibited the virulence factors hemolysin, lipase, protease, phospholipase, and bioflim formation. It was found that candesartan inhibited biofilm formation by 60.48-67.91%, hemolysin activity (61.21-74.14%), phospholipase activity (40-49.67%), lipase activity (58.97-73%), and protease activity (52.63%), while domperidone was found to inhibit biofilm formation by 70.54-77.49%, hemolysin activity (64.84-69.84%), phospholipase activity (49.67-60%), lipase activity (50-54.87%), and protease activity (52.63-57.9%). Quantitative real time-PCR confirmed the anti-virulence activity of domperidone and candesartan as both drugs significantly reduce the expression of the virulence genes SAP2, SAP6, PLB1, PLB2, LIP4, LIP5. In conclusion, domperidone and candesartan could serve as anti-virulence agents for treatment of C. albicans infections.
Sacubitril/valsartan was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </= 40%. This approval was based on PARADIGM-HF trial. Subsequently, PARAGON-HF was conducted to support a claim for sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), defined as LVEF >/= 45%. PARAGON-HF failed to meet the pre-defined threshold for statistical significance for the primary composite endpoint. However, analysis of the primary endpoint by LVEF as a continuous variable demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan was efficacious in patients with mildly abnormal LVEF similar to patients with LVEF </= 40% evaluated in PARADIGM-HF. This led to a broader indication for sacubitril/valsartan-"to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal. LVEF is a variable measure, so use clinical judgment in deciding whom to treat." This article describes the rationale for a revised indication for sacubitril/valsartan, emphasizes the need to go beyond a dichotomous classification of HF based on a traditional LVEF cut-off and clarifies that the product label for sacubitril/valsartan does not refer to HFpEF.
OBJECTIVE: Myocardial infarction has unfavorable effect on structural and functional properties of the myocardium, referred to as cardiac remodeling. Left ventricular mass, left ventricular mass index, and relative wall thickness are important predictors of cardiac remodeling. In this study, we investigated the effect of candesartan treatment in comparison with zofenopril treatment on echocardiographic indices of cardiac remodeling in post myocardial infarction patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, patients who underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly assigned to a candesartan or zofenopril treatment. After randomization, echocardiographic indices of cardiac remodeling including left ventricular mass, left ventricular mass index, and relative wall thickness were evaluated before the start of treatment along with 1- and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: According to our study, candesartan group showed significant reduction of estimated left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index at 6-month follow-up visit compared to baseline values (199.53+/-38.51 g vs. 212.69+/-40.82 g; 99.05 g/m2 (90.00-116.5) vs. 106.0 g/m2 (96.0 approximately 123.00), p<0.05, respectively). This trend was also observed in zofenopril group during the 6-month period (201.22+/-40.07 g vs. 207.52+/-41.61 g; 101.0 g/m2 (92.25-111.75.0) vs. 104.50 g/m2 (95.0 approximately 116.75), p<0.05, respectively). Although both classes of drugs had favorable effects on post-myocardial infarction cardiac remodeling, the absolute benefit was more prominent in candesartan group as compared to zofenopril group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that candesartan treatment following myocardial infarction may potentially be useful in terms of improving post-myocardial infarction cardiac remodeling.
