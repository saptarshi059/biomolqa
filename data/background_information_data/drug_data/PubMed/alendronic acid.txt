Cherubism is a rare disease of the jaws characterized by bilateral symmetrical painless expansion of the mandible and maxilla. In extreme cases, larger lesions can become exophytic and have profound functional and esthetic implications. Several pharmacologic agents have been trialed in the treatment of cherubism with variable success reported. Bisphosphonates have not been significantly studied in this setting. We present a case where oral alendronic acid was used as an adjuvant treatment after surgical debulking of the maxilla in a 13-year-old boy with a severe case of cherubism.
BACKGROUND: Valvular calcification is central to the pathogenesis and progression of aortic stenosis, with preclinical and observational studies suggesting that bone turnover and osteoblastic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells are important contributory mechanisms. We aimed to establish whether inhibition of these pathways with denosumab or alendronic acid could reduce disease progression in aortic stenosis. METHODS: In a single-center, parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients >50 years of age with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity >2.5 m/s) were randomized 2:1:2:1 to denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), placebo injection, alendronic acid (70 mg once weekly), or placebo capsule. Participants underwent serial assessments with Doppler echocardiography, computed tomography aortic valve calcium scoring, and (18)F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The primary end point was the calculated 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (mean age, 72+/-8 years; 21% women) with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity, 3.36 m/s [2.93-3.82 m/s]; aortic valve calcium score, 1152 AU [655-2065 AU]) were randomized and received the allocated trial intervention: denosumab (n=49), alendronic acid (n=51), and placebo (injection n=25, capsule n=25; pooled for analysis). Serum C-terminal telopeptide, a measure of bone turnover, halved from baseline to 6 months with denosumab (0.23 [0.18-0.33 microg/L] to 0.11 microg/L [0.08-0.17 microg/L]) and alendronic acid (0.20 [0.14-0.28 microg/L] to 0.09 microg/L [0.08-0.13 microg/L]) but was unchanged with placebo (0.23 [0.17-0.30 microg/L] to 0.26 microg/L [0.16-0.31 microg/L]). There were no differences in 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score between denosumab and placebo (343 [198-804 AU] versus 354 AU [76-675 AU]; P=0.41) or alendronic acid and placebo (326 [138-813 AU] versus 354 AU [76-675 AU]; P=0.49). Similarly, there were no differences in change in peak aortic jet velocity or (18)F-sodium fluoride aortic valve uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Neither denosumab nor alendronic acid affected progression of aortic valve calcification in patients with calcific aortic stenosis. Alternative pathways and mechanisms need to be explored to identify disease-modifying therapies for the growing population of patients with this potentially fatal condition.

We engineered nanomedicine with the stealth corona made up of densely packed bone seeking ligand, alendronic acid. In a typical nanoconstruct, alendronic acid is conjugated with hydrophilic head moiety of phospholipid that has an ability to self-assemble with hydrophobic polymeric core through its hydrophobic long carbon-chain. Proposed nanomedicine has three distinct compartments namely; poly(l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymeric core acting as a drug reservoir and skeleton of the nanoconstruct, phospholipid monolayer covers the core acting as a diffusion barrier, and a densely packed alendronic acid corona acting as a stabilizer and targeting moiety. Thus engineered nanomedicine attain spherical entity with ~90 +/- 6 nm having negative zeta potential, -37.7 +/- 2 mV, and has an ability to load 7 +/- 0.3 wt% of doxorubicin. In-vitro bone targeting efficiency of nanomedicine was studied using hydroxyapatite crystals as a bone model, and found significant accumulation of nanoparticle in the crystals. Moreover, cellular internalization studies with mouse osteosarcoma confirm the selectivity of nanomedicine when compared to its internalization in non-targeted mouse melanoma. This nanomedicine shows prolong stability in serum and deliver the drug into the cell exhibiting an IC50 of 3.7 muM. Given the strong interacting property of alendronic acid with bone, the proposed nanomedicine hold promises in delivering drug to bone microenvironment.
BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) affects a significant proportion of the adult population. Potent anti-resorptive drugs such as intravenous zoledronic acid have been demonstrated to reduce Modic changes (MCs) upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and concomitantly decrease associated LBP. It is uncertain whether oral alendronic acid has a similar effect. METHODS: 82 subjects were recruited in this case-control study. Treatment subjects (n = 41) received oral alendronic acid treatment for at least 1-year and were matched by gender and age (+/- 2) to control subjects (n = 41) not receiving any anti-osteoporotic medication. The prevalence, type, and extent of MCs were quantified upon T1 and T2-weighted MRIs of the lumbosacral spine. RESULTS: Treatment subjects received oral alendronic acid for 124.0 +/- 62.1 weeks at the time of MRI assessment and exhibited a lower prevalence of MCs over the lumbosacral spine (18/41 vs. 30/41, p < 0.001) as compared to control subjects. Amongst both groups, type 2 MCs were predominant. Quantification of type 2 MCs in treatment subjects revealed a significant reduction in area (113 +/- 106 mm(2) vs. 231 +/- 144 mm(2), p < 0.01) and volume (453 +/- 427 mm(3) vs. 925 +/- 575 mm(3), p < 0.01) affected by type 2 MCs in comparison to matched controls. CONCLUSION: Oral alendronic acid may be useful in the treatment of MC-associated LBP in patients with concomitant osteoporosis.
OBJECTIVES: to describe the efficacy and safety of the off-label use of alendronate in the treatment of osteoporosis in children and adolescents. METHOD: a retrospective study (2008-2014) of all patients under 18 years who were dispensed alendronate for this indication. The criteria for initiating treatment were: bone mineral density with a Z-score </= -2.5 SD, a past history of bone fractures without a previous traumatism, and persistent pain. The variables collected were: demographic, treatment-related, clinical. and safety data. The treatment was considered to be effective when there was an increase in bone mineral density up to a Z-score > -2.5 SD. RESULTS: a total of 12 patients, 8 of them male, with a mean age of 11 years (+/- 3 SD), were treated with alendronate. After a mean time of treatment of 2.15 years (+/- 1.2 SD), there was an increase in bone mineral density in all patients, 9 of which achieved a Z-score > -2.5 SD, so the drug was considered effective in 75% of cases. No patient had bone fractures or expressed adverse effects during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: alendronate increased bone mineral density and was well tolerated in all patients, therefore it could be considered as a therapeutic option in the treatment of osteoporosis in children.
BACKGROUND: Delayed esophageal transit or disintegration of oral bisphosphonate tablets before they enter the stomach may be of concern with respect to iatrogenic complications among patients receiving longterm treatment. Different formulations of generic bisphosphonate tablets meeting regulatory requirements may have substantial differences in pharmaceutical attributes from the branded product that may result in different characteristics during esophageal transit. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and compare esophageal transit times and in vivo disintegration of 3 bisphosphonate formulations, one branded and the others generic, that are commercially available in Canada and the United Kingdom. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, singleblind, 6-period crossover study in healthy postmenopausal women aged >50 years. Each subject received a single oral dose of a branded risedronate sodium 35-mg tablet and 2 generic formulations of alendronic acid 70-mg tablets (Novopharm Limited, Toronto, Canada, and Teva UK Limited, Morley, United Kingdom) in both the erect and semisupine (45 degrees ) positions. Although the products are labeled to be taken in the erect position, the semisupine position was included to simulate dosing in bedridden patients. Subjects took tablets with 30 mL of water in the morning after an overnight fast. The tablets were radiolabeled with technetium-99m ion-exchange resins to enable visualization and measurement of esophageal transit time and disintegration using a gamma camera. Dynamic scintigraphic images were obtained for a total of 10 minutes: 2 images per second for the first 30 seconds and 1 image every 15 seconds for 9.5 minutes. This was a mechanistic study and tolerability was not assessed. RESULTS: The study was conducted in 20 healthy white female subjects with a mean age of 62 years (range, 51-77 years). The effect of body position was statistically significant (P = 0.043), with the estimated hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74 indicating longer transit time in the semisupine position relative to the erect position. There was a statistically significant difference in transit time among the 3 types of tablets (P = 0.007), with the Novopharm tablet (HR = 0.59; P < 0.001) and Teva tablet (HR = 0.71; P = 0.042) having longer transit times compared with the risedronate tablet. In 4 instances, the Novopharm tablet disintegrated and dispersed in the esophagus, once in the erect position and 3 times in the semisupine position. CONCLUSIONS: In these healthy female subjects, esophageal transit was delayed when the tablets were given in the semisupine position. The branded risedronate tablet had a significantly faster transit time than the 2 generic formulations of alendronate tested.
BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of alendronic acid once weekly relative to risedronic acid once weekly on bone mineral density (BMD), markers of bone turnover and tolerability in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This was a randomised, double-masked, double-dummy multicentre international study (75 centres in 27 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia-Pacific). A total of 1303 women were screened and 936 with low bone density (T-score < or = -2.0 at the spine, hip trochanter, total hip or femoral neck) were randomised; 91% (n = 854) completed the study. Patients were randomised to treatment with either active alendronic acid 70 mg weekly (Fosamax) and placebo identical to risedronic acid weekly or active risedronic acid 35 mg weekly (Actonel) and placebo identical to alendronic acid weekly for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in hip trochanter BMD at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included the percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD; biochemical markers of bone turnover (including serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP] and urinary type I collagen N-telopeptides [NTx]); and safety and tolerability as assessed by reporting of adverse experiences. RESULTS: Alendronic acid produced greater increases in BMD than did risedronic acid at 12 months at all sites measured. Mean percentage increases from baseline in hip trochanter BMD at month 12 were 3.56% and 2.71% in the alendronic acid and risedronic acid groups, respectively (treatment difference [95% CI]: 0.83% [0.22, 1.45; p = 0.008]). Mean percentage increases from baseline were greater with alendronic acid than risedronic acid at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD at month 12 (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, p = 0.039, respectively). Increases in BMD with alendronic acid compared with risedronic acid were also significantly greater at 6 months at the trochanter and total hip. There was a greater reduction in bone turnover with alendronic acid compared with risedronic acid: NTx decreased 58% with alendronic acid compared with 47% with risedronic acid at 12 months (p < 0.001); and BSAP decreased 45% with alendronic acid compared with 34% with risedronic acid at 12 months (p < 0.001). Overall tolerability and upper gastrointestinal tolerability were similar for both agents. CONCLUSIONS: Alendronic acid once weekly produced greater BMD increases at both hip and spine sites and greater reductions in bone turnover relative to risedronic acid once weekly. Both agents were well tolerated with no significant difference in upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences. Clinicians should consider these results when making treatment decisions for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis and fragility fractures are common in the elderly population and represent a large public health burden. Non-pharmacological recommendations for the management of osteoporosis include modification of lifestyle behaviours, increased weight-bearing exercise and consumption - through dietary or supplement sources - of adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. Although current guidelines include recommendations on calcium and vitamin D intake, patients frequently do not take sufficient amounts, even when supplements are provided free of charge. Vitamin D is essential for mineral metabolism, and low levels are associated with impaired skeletal metabolism and neuromuscular function. Nutritional sources of vitamin D are limited, and supplementation is usually necessary. A high prevalence of low vitamin D levels has been reported in a number of populations worldwide, including women being treated for osteoporosis and those with fragility fractures. At present, bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis, and alendronic acid is the most frequently prescribed bisphosphonate. A nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, alendronic acid has demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy at vertebral and non-vertebral skeletal sites, including the hip, in addition to long-term safety and efficacy. Weekly administration of alendronic acid takes advantage of the pharmacokinetics of the drug and osteoclast biology to optimise treatment, and may improve patient adherence. Combining alendronic acid 70mg and colecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) 2800 IU in a single, once-weekly tablet has the advantage of combining the proven efficacy of an established bisphosphonate, alendronic acid, with the amount of vitamin D currently recommended for osteoporosis management.
A simple and quick-response fluorescent biosensor for Salmonella typhimurium detection based on the recognition of an aptamer coupled with alendronic acid (ADA)@upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been developed. Briefly, the aptamer can adsorb on the surfaces of the AuNPs via a "Au-S" bond to protect the AuNPs from aggregation in highly concentrated salt solution. Then, the AuNPs and UCNPs are linked by electrostatic adsorption, which leads to a decrease in the fluorescence peak at 541 nm based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the UCNPs and AuNPs. In the presence of Salmonella typhimurium, the "Au-S" bond was broken, and the fluorescence intensity at 541 nm was recovered. Under optimal conditions, the correlation between the concentration of S. typhimurium and the intensity of the fluorescent biosensor signals was observed to be linear within the range of 1.16 x 10(2) to 1.16 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1) (R(2) = 0.9912), and the detection limit of the developed biosensor was observed to be 36 CFU mL(-1). Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully used to detect the Salmonella typhimurium pathogen in food samples with satisfactory results.
This study analyzed the influence of titanium (TiO(2) ) surface modifications with two osteogenic proteins (BMP-2, BMP-7) and an anti-osteoclastic drug (alendronic acid [AA]) on sandblasted/acid-etched (SLA) and plain TiO(2) (PT) on cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation (alkaline phosphatase [AP] and osteocalcin [OC]) of bone-marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) after 1, 3 and 7 days in-vitro. Initially, AA surfaces showed the highest cell number and surface coverage. At day 3 and 7, BMP and AA-modified surfaces exhibited a significantly enhanced cell growth. For proliferation, at days 3 and 7, an enhancement on BMP-2, BMP-7 and AA-surfaces was seen. At day 7, SLA also showed a higher proliferation when compared to PT. Initially, AP expression was elevated on SLA and AA surfaces. At days 3 and 7, a significant increased AP expression was seen for SLA, BMP-2, BMP-7 and AA discs. For OC, SLA and AA surfaces had the highest expression after 1 day whereas after 3 and 7 days a significant difference was recorded for SLA, BMP-2, BMP-7 and AA. In conclusion, a beneficial biological effect of a chemical immobilization method of BMP-2, BMP-7 and alendronate onto titanium surfaces on BMSCs was proven.
BACKGROUND: We recently developed a liposomal nanoparticle system that can be used for drug delivery and simultaneously be monitored by optical or photoacoustic imaging devices. Here we tested the efficacy of alendronate as a homing molecule in SM-liposomes for bone targeting. METHODS: Alendronate was immobilized covalently on the liposomal surface and the fluorescent dye indocyanine green was used as a payload in the liposomes. The indocyanine green delivery was analyzed by 3D optical tomography, optical fluorescence scanner, photoacoustic imaging, and by ex-vivo biodistribution studies. RESULTS: The results show that the alendronate, coupled to the liposomal surface, increases sphingomyelin containing liposome targeting up to several-folds. CONCLUSION: The alendronate targeted liposomes open possibilities for an application in active bone targeting.
There is a concern that bisphosphonates may impair fracture healing because of their inhibitory effects on bone turnover. Here we evaluated the effects of early bisphosphonate therapy on fracture healing and functional outcome following a fracture of the distal radius. The fracture and bisphosphonates (FAB) trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 15 trauma centers in the United Kingdom. We enrolled 421 bisphosphonate-naive patients aged >/=50 years with a radiographically confirmed fracture of the distal radius and randomized them in a 1:1 ratio to receive alendronic acid 70 mg once weekly (n = 215) or placebo (n = 206) within 14 days of the fracture. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of fractures that had radiologically united at 4 weeks as assessed by an observer, blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, range of wrist movement and grip strength, pain and analgesia requirements, and the rate of malunion. The mean +/- SD age of participants was 63 +/- 8.5 years and 362 (86%) were female. At 4 weeks, 48 of 202 (23.8%) fractures had united in the alendronic acid group compared with 52 of 187 (27.8%) in the placebo group (observed absolute proportion difference 4.0%; 95% CI, -4.7% to 12.8%; p = 0.36). The absolute proportion difference between groups based on imputed data was 4.5% (95% CI, -4.7% to 13.8%; p = 0.30). There was no significant difference in the proportion of fractures that had united at any other time point and no differences in the DASH score, pain at the fracture site, grip strength, or any other clinical outcome. We conclude that among patients aged 50 years and above with a distal radius fracture, early administration of alendronic acid does not adversely affect fracture union or clinical outcome. These findings suggest bisphosphonate therapy can be safely commenced early after fracture if clinically indicated. (c) 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
Vitamin D, an essential micronutrient crucial for skeletal integrity and various non-skeletal physiological functions, exhibits limited bioavailability and stability in vivo. This study is focused on the development of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-grafted phospholipid micellar nanostructures co-encapsulating vitamin D3 and conjugated with alendronic acid, aimed at active bone targeting. Furthermore, these nanostructures are rendered optically traceable in the UV-visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum via the simultaneous encapsulation of vitamin D3 with carbon dots, a newly emerging class of fluorescents, biocompatible nanoparticles characterized by their resistance to photobleaching and environmental friendliness, which hold promise for future in vitro bioimaging studies. A systematic investigation is conducted to optimize experimental parameters for the preparation of micellar nanostructures with an average hydrodynamic diameter below 200 nm, ensuring colloidal stability in physiological media while preserving the optical luminescent properties of the encapsulated carbon dots. Comprehensive chemical-physical characterization of these micellar nanostructures is performed employing optical and morphological techniques. Furthermore, their binding affinity for the principal inorganic constituent of bone tissue is assessed through a binding assay with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, indicating significant potential for active bone-targeting. These formulated nanostructures hold promise for novel therapeutic interventions to address skeletal-related complications in cancer affected patients in the future.
Bisphosphonates are commonly prescribed medications to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Although possessing low side effect profiles, the potential for severe topical effects is rare but important. Irritation of the upper gastrointestinal tract is well documented; however, the risk and effects of accidental aspiration are rarely reported.Attention is drawn to a case recently managed at a tertiary head and neck centre where a patient in their 70s was admitted in respiratory distress 3 days after aspirating alendronic acid. This case highlights the potential risk of topical chemical injury posed to the airway by bisphosphonates.Bisphosphonates should be prescribed with detailed and specific counselling regarding this risk. Pharmacological product literature should be updated to reflect the risk. Clinical teams should be aware of and vigilant for the delayed presentation and prolonged symptom course of such injuries. Prompt airway intervention and techniques to minimise further mucosal trauma ensure optimal outcomes.
A 79-year-old woman was prescribed bisphosphonates 3 years ago for osteoporosis. At the time of first prescription, she received counselling directions on how to take her medication, which she stringently adhered to. However, she accidentally aspirated an alendronic acid tablet and subsequently developed respiratory tract symptoms. An emergency bronchoscopy was performed. We describe the marked bronchoscopic changes following aspiration of alendronic acid.
