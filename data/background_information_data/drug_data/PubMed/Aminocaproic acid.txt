In a patient with giant-cell carcinoma of the lung a secondary tumour deposit in the arm was incised and bled for three weeks. Investigations showed the tumour to be rich in plasminogen activator. Haemostasis in the tumour was achieved with aminocaproic acid therapy. For a period the plasminogen-activator properties were retained in cell culture of the tumour.
Early diagnosis of AL amyloidosis and appreciation of the nutritional and coagulation abnormalities associated with liver and gastrointestinal involvement are critically important in the treatment and management. In cases of severe malabsorption total parenteral nutrition can be extremely helpful as a bridge to organ improvement. Rarely the use of antifibrinolytic agents such as oral aminocaproic acid with transfusion support may control severe bleeding in patients with coagulation abnormalities. It is important to keep in mind that organ improvement should follow in lag phase after the reduction in the pathologic free light chain with treatment. Closely following light chain levels may permit brief holidays from treatment and enable periods of recovery before resuming therapy in patients with prompt early and deep hematologic responses.
Antifibrinolytic agents play a prominent role in adult cardiac surgery. This article is a review of the modern published experience of antifibrinolytic agent use in adult cardiac surgery. The use of tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and aprotinin is examined during primary cardiac surgery, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, reoperative cardiac surgery, and off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. In addition, the issues of vein graft patency and hypersensitivity reaction in the presence of antifibrinolytic agents are examined.
This pilot study of 16 patients explored the use of two fibrinolytic inhibitors, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid, for the suppression of tumor-associated hemorrhage. The effects of such bleeding include anemia requiring transfusion, practical difficulties with dressings, and psychological morbidity from constant reminder of poor physical health. Cessation of bleeding occurred in 14 of the 16 patients treated. The average time until significant improvement in bleeding was just 2 days and the average time for complete cessation was 4 days. We conclude that fibrinolytic inhibitors are potentially useful agents in palliative care.
Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) is a potent anti-fibrinolytic agent that is used in the treatment of excessive bleeding resulting from a systemic fibrinolytic state. It can also be used to treat hematuria through its action on decreasing urinary fibrinolysis. A broad range of renal complications has been ascribed to EACA. Although they are rare, they may be life-threatening and should therefore be immediately recognized.
