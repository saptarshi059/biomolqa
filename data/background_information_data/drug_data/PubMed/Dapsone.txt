An understanding of the clinical significance of dapsone-drug interactions is essential for optimal use of this agent. This review aims to provide clinicians with an overview of this topic.
Dapsone is used in the treatment of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBD), a group of disorders resulting from autoimmunity directed against basement membrane and/or intercellular adhesion molecules on cutaneous and mucosal surfaces. This review summarizes the limited published data evaluating dapsone as a therapy for AIBD.
Methaemoglobinaemia is an uncommon but potentially serious condition. It can be caused by congenital or acquired cause. Drug-induced methaemoglobinaemia is the commonest cause of acquired methaemoglobinaemia. The clinical signs and symptoms of methaemoglobinaemia include dyspnoea, desaturation, presence of saturation gap, headache, nausea and seizures depending on level of serum methaemoglobinaemia. We illustrate a case of dapsone-induced methaemoglobinaemia and its successful treatment by intravenous methylene blue.

Dapsone and sulfapyridine are structurally related compounds with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. Dapsone remains the most important drug for leprosy and is useful in the prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with HIV disease. The medical treatment of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis is dapsone; and sulfapyridine also can be used for those patients who are intolerant of dapsone. Other neutrophilic disorders also may respond to these drugs. Toxic side effects of both dapsone and sulfapyridine are mediated through the hydroxylamine metabolite. These include hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and agranulocytosis. Careful monitoring for possible adverse reactions includes frequently performing complete blood counts and regular blood chemistry profile determinations.
