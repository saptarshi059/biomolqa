Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic bacterium found in the human mouth where it causes periodontitis. It was also found in colorectal cancer tissues and is linked with pregnancy complications, including pre-term and stillbirths. Cell surface structures of the bacterium could be implicated in pathogenesis. Here we report four new structures of the lipopolysaccharide O-chain (OPS) from five strains of F. nucleatum CTX47T, CC2_6JVN3, CC2_3FMU1, CC2_1JVN3, HM-996, isolated from cancerous tissues. Three of the four structures have a common sequence of hexose-diaminofucose-hexitol-phosphate in the main chain.
In the last two decades, a variety of fungal antioxidants have attracted considerable interest, largely arising from their hypothetical role as virulence determinants. Melanin is a potent free radical scavenger and in Cryptococcus neoformans, there is now good evidence that the production of melanin is a significant virulence determinant. There is also recent evidence linking melanin biosynthesis to the virulence of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia. Superoxide dismutases are important housekeeping antioxidants and have an additional hypothetical role in virulence; however, although these enzymes have been biochemically characterized from Aspergillus and Cryptococcus, there is as yet no firm evidence that these enzymes are involved in pathogenicity. Catalase production may play some role in the virulence of Candida albicans but this enzyme has not been shown, as yet, to influence the virulence of A. fumigatus. There are some data supporting an antioxidant function for the acyclic hexitol mannitol in C. neoformans, but further investigations are required in this area. Research into the putative antioxidant activities of a range of other fungal enzymes, such as acid phosphatases, remains limited at this time.
OBJECTIVE: To confirm the causality of gut microbiota pathway abundance and knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: Microbial metabolic pathways were taken as exposures, with data from the Dutch Microbiome Project (DMP). Data on KOA from the UK Biobank were utilized as endpoints. In addition, we extracted significant and independent single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was applied to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota pathway abundance and KOA, and MR-Egger and weighted median were used as additional validation of the MR results. Meanwhile, Cochran Q, MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out were used to perform sensitivity analyses on the MR results. RESULTS: MR results showed that enterobactin biosynthesis, diacylglycerol biosynthesis I, Clostridium acetobutylicum acidogenic fermentation, glyoxylate bypass and tricarboxylic acid cycle were the risk factors for KOA. (OR = 1.13,95%CI = 1.04-1.23;OR = 1.12,95%CI = 1.04-1.20;OR = 1.14,95%CI = 1.04-1.26; OR = 1.06,95%CI = 1.00-1.12) However, adenosylcobalamin salvage from cobinamide I, hexitol fermentation to lactate formate ethanol and acetate, purine nucleotides degradation II aerobic, L tryptophan biosynthesis and inosine 5 phosphate biosynthesis III pathway showed significant protection against KOA. (OR = 0.93,95%CI = 0.86-1.00;OR = 0.94,95%CI = 0.88-1.00;OR = 0.91,95%CI = 0.86-0.97;OR = 0.95,95%CI = 0.92-0.99; OR = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.85-0.98) Further multiplicity and sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Our study identified specific metabolic pathways in gut microbiota that promote or inhibit KOA, which provides the most substantial evidence-based medical evidence for the pathogenesis and prevention of KOA.
Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that significantly impacts individuals' sleep quality and daily life. Recent studies have suggested that gut microbiota may influence sleep through various metabolic pathways. This study aims to explore the causal relationships between the abundance of gut microbiota metabolic pathways and insomnia using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. This two-sample MR study used genetic data from the OpenGWAS database (205 gut bacterial pathway abundance) and the FinnGen database (insomnia-related data). We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with gut bacterial pathway abundance as instrumental variables (IVs) and ensured their validity through stringent selection criteria and quality control measures. The primary analysis employed the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by other MR methods, to estimate causal effects. The MR analysis revealed significant positive causal effects of specific carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism pathways on insomnia. Key pathways, such as gluconeogenesis pathway (GLUCONEO.PWY) and TCA cycle VII acetate producers (PWY.7254), showed positive associations with insomnia (B > 0, p < 0.05). Conversely, pathways like hexitol fermentation to lactate, formate, ethanol and acetate pathway (P461.PWY) exhibited negative causal effects (B < 0, p < 0.05). Multivariable MR analysis confirmed the independent causal effects of these pathways (p < 0.05). Sensitivity analyses indicated no significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity, ensuring the robustness of the results. This study identifies specific gut microbiota metabolic pathways that play critical roles in the development of insomnia. These findings provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying insomnia and suggest potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Future research should further validate these causal relationships and explore how modulating gut microbiota or its metabolic products can effectively improve insomnia symptoms, leading to more personalized and precise treatment strategies.
Hexitol nucleic acid (HNA) is a new steric blocking oligonucleotide, hybridizing sequence selectively with RNA. The biological activity of HNA was evaluated in an in vitro translation arrest system targeting Ha-ras mRNA and in a cellular system targeting intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. HNA very efficiently and selectively inhibited Ha-ras mRNA translation (IC(50) of 50 nM) when targeted at the translation initiation region. When targeting at the 12th codon region, a gap-mer approach was needed to inhibit mRNA translation. Similarly, HNA inhibited ICAM-1 expression in keratinocytes when targeting at codon sequences. In this test system, HNA is less active but more selective than phosphorothioates, but needs lipofection to become active in keratinocytes. This new steric blocker may be an efficient antisense agent providing that enough material can be brought into cells.
