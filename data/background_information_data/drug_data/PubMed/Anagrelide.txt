Thrombocytosis is an increasingly recognized clinical problem due to the widespread availability of automated cell counters. While reactive thrombocytosis does not require any therapeutic intervention, clonal thrombocytosis may require therapy to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. The clinician has a number of therapeutic options available when confronted with a patient having clonal thrombocytosis. One of these agents is anagrelide (Agrylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb). In this drug profile, a synopsis of the available data on this agent and its role in the control of thrombocytosis will be provided. The main side effects of the medication are discussed, as well as the potential future developments in the field.
Essential thrombocythemia patients develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at a rate of 1-4% during a median follow-up of 7-10 years. The risk increases with advanced age, anemia, platelet count >/= 1000 x 10(9)/l, the presence of >/= 2 somatic mutations and after the first decade of diagnosis. The use of alkylating agents and (32)radiophosphorus, particularly in higher doses, but not hydroxyurea and anagrelide, increases the risk. AML in essential thrombocythemia patients is frequently associated with unfavorable cytogenetics and poor prognosis. In young and fit patients, AML-type induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation may offer the best chance of long-term disease control. In select elderly patients with poor performance status, hypomethylating agent such as azacytidine may prolong survival.
Significant progress in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and the other Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) has recently been achieved. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of ET still relies on a set of exclusion criteria developed years ago, as recent advances have yet to be evaluated for this purpose. The clinical course of ET is characterized by an increased incidence of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and an inherent tendency to progress into myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There is concern about undesirable effects of cytoreductive therapy given to prevent vascular events, particularly the risk of accelerating the rate of hematologic transformation. Thus, management involves modification of reversible vascular risk factors and further stratification according to the thrombotic risk. Myelosuppressive agents are not recommended in low-risk patients, whereas controlled studies support the therapeutic value of hydroxyurea (HU) plus aspirin in high-risk cases. Anagrelide or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) could be considered as second-line therapy in patients refractory or intolerant of HU. IFN-alpha is preferred in pregnant women.
Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.
Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by persistent elevation in platelet count. It is a rare disorder in children, and children who have symptoms require treatment. We report the successful use of anagrelide, with few toxic effects, in the treatment of three children with ET.
