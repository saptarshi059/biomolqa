Dose-comparison studies in chronic, continuously hospitalized patients show that megadoses of antipsychotic drugs are reasonably well tolerated. These findings, together with dose-comparison studies in acute patients, support the notion (and current practice) that the therapeutic index of antipsychotic drugs is wide. Recent work with outpatients indicates that fluphenazine decanoate 5 mg (versus 25 mg) every 2 weeks is effective for at least the first year. In addition, patients report feeling better when they take the lower dose. A dose-comparison study with haloperidol in newly admitted patients indicates that a 20 mg daily dose has neurotoxic effects. A similar dose-comparison study with oral fluphenazine indicates that a 5 mg daily dose is efficacious over a 3-week period. Thus, both inpatients and outpatients can be managed on doses that were formerly regarded as homeopathic. Patients taking low doses have fewer side effects (particularly less akinesia) and probably fewer dysphoric emotions than patients taking high doses, although they improve at a slower rate.
Seventeen antipsychotic medications are available in the U.S. Antipsychotic formulary considerations include relative efficacy, individual patient response, relative differences in adverse effects, dosage form availability, blood level monitoring, and generic availability. Chlorpromazine, thioridazine, haloperidol, and fluphenazine are recommended for formulary inclusion based on research and clinical considerations. A recommendation for managing a patient receiving a nonformulary antipsychotic is presented.
A 45-year-old male patient presented with a bilateral maculopathy following unprotected exposure of less than two minutes' duration to a manual metal arc welding unit. He had been receiving the drug fluphenazine for the previous 10 years for treatment of depression. We believe that the drug fluphenazine, which had accumulated in his retinal pigment epithelium, may have rendered him particularly susceptible to retinal photic damage.
Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) inhibits firing of dopaminergic neurons and is thus potentially useful in the treatment of schizophrenia. GHB was administered to 10 schizophrenics concurrently with low-dose fluphenazine in a 6-week double-blind crossover study. No antipsychotic efficacy of GHB was noted. GHB had little if any effect on plasma prolactin levels after a single administration and caused few side effects. Trials with higher doses of GHB may be warranted.
We present here a potential new treatment adjunct for glioblastoma. Building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the SVZ. Further studies showed that SVZ cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. Dopamine signaling through D3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. Since psychiatry has several drugs with good D3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these D3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on SVZ cells.
