BACKGROUND AND AIM: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a potentially life-threatening infection in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. Its prevention is vital to improve prognosis of cirrhotic patients. The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate what is the most efficacious and safest antibiotic prophylactic strategy. METHODS: Studies were located by searching PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library until February 2019. Randomized controlled trials evaluating primary or secondary spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with ascites were included. The selection of studies was performed in two stages: screening of titles and abstracts, and assessment of the full papers identified as relevant, considering the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted in a standardized way and synthesized qualitatively. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. This systematic review demonstrated that daily norfloxacin is effective as a prophylactic antibiotic for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis. Once weekly ciprofloxacin was not inferior to once daily norfloxacin, with good tolerance and no induced resistance. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin have similar efficacy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, however, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with an increased risk of developing an adverse event. Rifaximin was more effective than norfloxacin in the secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with a significant decrease in adverse events and mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous long-term selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin is the most widely used prophylactic strategy in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, yet other equally effective and safe options are available.
A review of the pharmacokinetics of the highly active quinoline derivative, norfloxacin, is presented. The compound appears to be rapidly absorbed. The serum half-life is about 3 X 5 h and 30% of a given dose is recovered in the urine. Rapid penetration of an inflammatory exudate occurs. The compound is metabolized to a modest extent, probably in the liver, six metabolites being recognized. The serum half-life is prolonged in severe renal impairment. Probenecid would appear to decrease the renal elimination. The possibility of treating both urinary and tissue infections with this compound is raised.
A review of worldwide clinical trials with norfloxacin in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), as well as our personal experience with 215 assessable patients, is presented. Almost all patients received 400 mg b.i.d. for 3-15 days. Bacteriological eradication (10(4) CFU/ml of urine or less) was achieved in more than 90% of patients. Short-term therapy (3 days) with norfloxacin proved to be as effective and tolerable as a 10- to 14-day conventional therapeutic schedule in the treatment of lower uncomplicated UTIs. Overall incidence of drug-related adverse experiences was 2.3%.
Hen's egg lysozyme (HEL) activity was measured in vitro with gentamicin and norfloxacin by a turbidimetric technique. Gentamicin at the concentration of 10(-3) M inhibited HEL activity by 39%, while 10(-3) M norfloxacin did not affect HEL activity. However, an in vivo study in healthy persons did not show any significant statistical difference in tear lysozyme activity when 0.3% gentamicin or 0.3% norfloxacin were topically applied.
INTRODUCTION: With the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) has been debated. The aim of this study was to assess factors impacting effectiveness of SBP prophylaxis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Registry from inception to May 2019 to identify randomized controlled trials of patients with liver cirrhosis that assessed SBP occurrence/recurrence during antibiotic prophylaxis with the common antibiotic agents. Network meta-analysis was performed, pooling data with regard to incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of SBP, death, or extraperitoneal infections. RESULTS: Overall, 1,626 patients in 12 randomized controlled trials were included. During primary prophylaxis, the incidence rate of SBP and death in the norfloxacin-treated patients was 0.117 and 0.438 per patient-year, respectively, and IRRs of placebo vs norfloxacin were significantly higher (IRR 5.35, 95% confidence interval 1.99-14.38, P = 0.0009 for SBP and IRR 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.20-3.44, P = 0.008 for death). The efficacy of norfloxacin to prevent SBP, but not death, decreased over time (annual percent change from 1992 to 2015 8.2%, P = 0.019), The positive treatment effect was lower in studies including patients with increased ascites protein (P = 0.021) or exceedingly high serum bilirubin (P = 0.012) levels. Norfloxacin was not superior to other antibiotics. The incidence rate of SBP was 2.5-fold higher in patients treated with norfloxacin as secondary compared with primary prophylaxis. No significant differences between treatment designs were observed in secondary prophylaxis. DISCUSSION: Norfloxacin remained superior to placebo in preventing SBP, yet the efficacy to prevent SBP, not death, decreased over time. Further studies to understand this phenomenon are urgently needed.
