Desflurane has a carbon equivalence 20 times greater than sevoflurane. This article discusses alternative anaesthetic techniques, including sevoflurane, xenon, total intravenous anaesthesia and regional techniques, and methods of reducing venting of gases, which might lower the environmental impact of anaesthesia.
BACKGROUND: The effect of intraoperative anesthetic regimen on pulmonary outcome after minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is yet undetermined. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of volatile anesthesia (sevoflurane or desflurane) compared with propofol-based intravenous anesthesia on pulmonary complications after minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS: Patients scheduled for minimally invasive esophagectomy were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 general anesthetic regimens (sevoflurane, desflurane, or propofol). The primary outcome was the incidence of pulmonary complications within the 7 days postoperatively, which was a collapsed composite end point, including respiratory infection, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, atelectasis, respiratory failure, bronchospasm, pulmonary embolism, and aspiration pneumonitis. The severity of pulmonary complications, surgery-related complications, and other secondary outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Of 647 patients assessed for eligibility, 558 were randomized, and 553 were analyzed. A total of 185 patients were assigned to the sevoflurane group, 185 in the desflurane, and 183 in the propofol group. Patients receiving a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane or desflurane) had a significantly lower incidence (36.5% vs 47.5%; odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.91; P = .013) and lower severity grade of pulmonary complications ( P = .035) compared to the patients receiving propofol. There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcomes between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy, the use of volatile anesthesia (sevoflurane or desflurane) resulted in the reduced risk and severity of pulmonary complications within the first 7 postoperative days as compared to propofol-based intravenous anesthesia.
Desflurane and sevoflurane provide one clear advantage over other currently available potent inhaled anesthetics. Their lower solubilities permit a more precise control over the delivery of anesthesia and a more rapid recovery from anesthesia. Most of their other properties reflect similar properties of their predecessors--with a few exceptions. Indeed, at concentrations of 1 MAC or less, the pharmacologic properties of these two agents differ little if at all. However, in contrast to desflurane, at concentrations exceeding 1 MAC sevoflurane has little or no respiratory irritant properties and may be used to rapidly induce anesthesia. Neither anesthetic seems to materially affect heart rate at concentrations lower than MAC, but at higher concentrations desflurane, but not sevoflurane, may increase heart rate. Desflurane strongly resists biodegradation and degradation by soda lime, whereas sevoflurane is vulnerable to degradation and the degradation by soda lime or Baralyme produces a toxic product. Thus, neither of these new anesthetics can be said to be ideal, but each may be a step in that direction.
Coronary heart disease is an affliction that is common and has an adverse effect on patients' quality of life and survival while also raising the risk of intraoperative anesthesia. Mitochondria are the organelles most closely associated with the pathogenesis, development, and prognosis of coronary heart disease. Ion abnormalities, an acidic environment, the production of reactive oxygen species, and other changes during abnormal myocardial metabolism cause the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, which disrupts electron transport, impairs mitochondrial function, and even causes cell death. Differences in reliability and cost-effectiveness between desflurane and other volatile anesthetics are minor, but desflurane has shown better myocardial protective benefits in the surgical management of patients with coronary artery disease. The results of myocardial protection by desflurane are briefly summarized in this review, and biological functions of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, mitochondrial electron transport chain, reactive oxygen species, adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and protein kinase C are discussed in relation to the protective mechanism of desflurane. This article also discusses the effects of desflurane on patient hemodynamics, myocardial function, and postoperative parameters during coronary artery bypass grafting. Although there are limited and insufficient clinical investigations, they do highlight the possible advantages of desflurane and offer additional suggestions for patients.
Desflurane is a halogenated ether inhalation general anaesthetic agent with low solubility in blood and body tissues, and approximately one-fifth the potency of isoflurane. The pharmacodynamic properties of desflurane generally resemble those of isoflurane; thus, it produces dose-dependent depression of the central nervous and cardiorespiratory systems, and tetanic fade at the neuromuscular junction. The alveolar equilibration of desflurane is rapid (90% complete at 30 minutes compared with 73% for isoflurane). Both desflurane and isoflurane are distributed to various tissues to a similar extent. Desflurane is resistant to chemical degradation and undergoes negligible metabolism (approximately equal to 10% of that seen with isoflurane). Desflurane 'wash-out' is approximately equal to 2 to 2.5 times faster than that of isoflurane in the first 2 hours after discontinuation of anaesthesia. The low solubility of desflurane facilitates a rapid induction of anaesthesia and precise control of the depth of anaesthesia (during maintenance). Results from a few clinical studies indicate that emergence from desflurane is significantly earlier (by approximately equal to 2 to 6 minutes) than that from propofol anaesthesia, whereas other studies do not concur. In comparison with isoflurane, emergence from desflurane anaesthesia is significantly earlier (by 5 minutes) after ambulatory and approximately equal to 50% earlier (also significant) after nonambulatory surgical procedures. Limited comparative studies with halothane or sevoflurane also suggest an earlier time of emergence from desflurane anaesthesia. Comparative studies of desflurane and propofol, and other inhalation agents, indicate that the times to toleration of oral fluids, sitting and discharge from recovery room are similar, regardless of the general anaesthetic agent administered. However, some limited data in elderly patients (aged > 65 years) suggest that this patient group spends a significantly shorter time in the postanaesthesia care unit after desflurane than after isoflurane anaesthesia. Differences, if any, in the recovery of cognitive and psychomotor functions after desflurane or propofol anaesthesia remain unclear. However, in comparison with isoflurane anaesthesia, recovery of these functions (up to 45 minutes post-operatively) occurs earlier after desflurane. Significantly fewer patients are subjectively impaired (i.e. drowsy, clumsy, fatigued or confused) upon recovery from desflurane than from isoflurane anaesthesia. Likewise, significantly fewer adult patients are delirious when recovering from desflurane than from isoflurane anaesthesia, though in paediatric patients delirium is more likely when recovering from desflurane than from halothane anaesthesia. Haemodynamic stability during coronary artery surgery is as well maintained with desflurane as with isoflurane, and the drug does not worsen the adverse postoperative outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
