Rosacea is a chronic cutaneous disorder affecting primarily the face, characterized by erythema, transient or persistent, telangiectasia, and inflammatory lesions including papulo-pustules and swelling. The essential component of the disease is the persistent erythema of facial skin. Episodes of flushing (acute-subacute intermittent vasodilation) are common. Swelling and erythema of the nose along with dilatation of the pilosebaceous poral orifices, known as rhinophyma, can be noted in chronic cases. Rosacea affects up to 10% of the world population and is especially noted in fair-skinned individuals aged 35-50. Women are affected more often than men. Several treatment modalities including topical medications, systemic drugs, lasers, and light-based therapies have been used for the management of rosacea with variable results. Topical medications such as azelaic acid, metronidazole, and sulfacetamide/sulfur, oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines, and oral retinoids alone or, most commonly, in combination form the mainstay of treatment. Light therapies such as intense pulsed light and pulsed dye laser are best used for the erythemato-telangiectatic type. Topical brimonidine, oxymetazoline, ivermectin, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, low-dose modified-release tetracyclines and botulinum toxin are the new additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. This article provides a comprehensive review of the various therapies used for rosacea.
BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin condition with multiple topical treatment options, but uncertain comparative effects. OBJECTIVE: We sought to systematically synthesize the benefits and harms of AD prescription topical treatments. METHODS: For the 2023 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters AD guidelines, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACS, ICTRP, and GREAT databases to September 5, 2022, for randomized trials addressing AD topical treatments. Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects network meta-analyses addressed AD severity, itch, sleep, AD-related quality of life, flares, and harms. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach informed certainty of evidence ratings. We classified topical corticosteroids (TCS) using 7 groups-group 1 being most potent. This review is registered in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/q5m6s). RESULTS: The 219 included trials (43,123 patients) evaluated 68 interventions. With high-certainty evidence, pimecrolimus improved 6 of 7 outcomes-among the best for 2; high-dose tacrolimus (0.1%) improved 5-among the best for 2; low-dose tacrolimus (0.03%) improved 5-among the best for 1. With moderate- to high-certainty evidence, group 5 TCS improved 6-among the best for 3; group 4 TCS and delgocitinib improved 4-among the best for 2; ruxolitinib improved 4-among the best for 1; group 1 TCS improved 3-among the best for 2. These interventions did not increase harm. Crisaborole and difamilast were intermediately effective, but with uncertain harm. Topical antibiotics alone or in combination may be among the least effective. To maintain AD control, group 5 TCS were among the most effective, followed by tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with AD, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, and moderate-potency TCS are among the most effective in improving and maintaining multiple AD outcomes. Topical antibiotics may be among the least effective.
In this systematic review, 55 structured articles on the therapeutic efficacy against pain and clinical signs of oral lichen planus (OLP) were analysed. The literature search was developed according to the criteria of the PRISMA system, selecting the tests performed using one of the following methodological designs: drug (active ingredient) vs. drug in different excipient or concentration, drug vs. different active principle, drug vs. phytotherapy and drug vs. treatment with phototherapy. Based on the results, an algorithm is proposed to guide the treatment of OLP in its atrophic and erosive clinical forms. The use of clobetasol propionate at 0.025-0.05% of topical application as the first therapeutic alternative is highlighted. Secondly, 0.1% tacrolimus and 1% pimecrolimus also formulated for its topical regimen. And finally, we address the use of systemic corticosteroids and the application of diode lasers.
Sensitive scalp is sensitive skin located on the scalp. Sensitivity is considered primary in the absence of an associated scalp disorder and secondary when caused by conditions such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. The clinical manifestations of primary sensitive scalp are subjective. Common presenting symptoms are burning, itching, trichodynia, and dysesthesia, often coinciding with hair loss. Clinically, the skin appears normal or red. An objective diagnosis based on laboratory or histologic findings is not possible. Triggers may be endogenous (e.g., stress and emotional or psychopathological disturbances) or exogeneous (e.g., topical products and cosmetics). Treatment must be individualized. Options include pimecrolimus, hydration with hyaluronic acid, and mesotherapy with plasma rich in growth factors.
Tinea incognito was first described 50 years ago. It is a dermatophytic infection with a clinical presentation modified by previous treatment with topical or systemic corticosteroids, as well as by the topical application of immunomodulators such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. Tinea incognito usually resembles neurodermatitis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, or contact dermatitis, and the diagnosis is frequently missed or delayed.
