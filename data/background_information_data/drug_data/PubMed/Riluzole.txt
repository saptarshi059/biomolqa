There are no approved disease-modifying therapies for any of the inherited cerebellar ataxias. Drug treatment in childhood ataxia is still very limited. Effective treatments are available for only a few rare metabolic hereditary disorders. Symptomatic management of associated tremor, spasticity, dystonia, or chorea can follow the medication recommendations in general usage. The foundation of management of cerebellar ataxia in adults or children remains rehabilitation.
Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer and is responsible for the majority of deaths from skin cancer. Therapeutic advances in the last few decades, notably the development of novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies have significantly improved patient outcomes; nonetheless, these options remain limited due to the onset of resistance to treatment modalities and relapse. In this review, we focus on the available therapeutic options, their benefits, and limitations.
BACKGROUND: Riluzole is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival, and to assess the effect of riluzole upon functional health. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011) and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized controlled trials TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS: The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P < 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49% in the placebo and 58% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.31). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Anhedonia is defined as a diminished ability to experience interest or pleasure, and is a critical psychopathological dimension of major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of the current systematic review is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological treatments on measures of anhedonia in adults with MDD. Electronic databases Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 1, 2018 for longitudinal studies utilizing pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anhedonia in patients with MDD. A total of 17 eligible studies were identified (i.e., evaluated the effects of pharmacotherapy on a measure of anhedonia). Among the identified studies, the efficacy of 14 different pharmacotherapies on measures of anhedonia were evaluated, including melatonergic agents (i.e. agomelatine), monoaminergic agents (i.e. moclobemide, clomipramine, bupropion, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, amitifadine and levomilnacipran, escitalopram, and sertraline), glutamatergic agents (i.e., ketamine and riluzole), stimulants (i.e., methylphenidate), and psychedelics (i.e., psilocybin). Based on the available evidence, most antidepressants demonstrated beneficial effects on measures of anhedonia as well as the other depressive symptoms. Only escitalopram/riluzole combination treatment was ineffective in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Continued research is warranted to further support the efficacy of mechanistically-distinct antidepressants in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Future research should also aim to parse out the heterogeneous effects of different pharmacotherapies on anhedonic symptoms.
Over the past decades, a multitude of experimental drugs have been shown to delay disease progression in preclinical animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but failed to show efficacy in human clinical trials or are still waiting for approval under Phase I-III trials. Riluzole, a glutamatergic neurotransmission inhibitor, is the only drug approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration for ALS treatment with modest benefits on survival. Recently, an antioxidant drug, edaravone, developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma was found to be effective in halting ALS progression during early stages. The newly approved drug edaravone is a force multiplier for ALS treatment. This short report provides an overview of the two drugs that have been approved for ALS treatment and highlights an update on the timeline of drug development, how clinical trials were done, the outcome of these trials, primary endpoint, mechanism of actions, dosing information, administration, side effects, and storage procedures. Moreover, we also discussed the pressing issues and challenges of ALS clinical trials and drug developments as well as future outlook.
