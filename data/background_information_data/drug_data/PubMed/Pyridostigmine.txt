Myasthenia gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular junction transmission, the result of antibodies against the post-synaptic aspect of the neuromuscular junction. Its clinical hallmark is fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles, which tends to vary in location and severity among patients. It is treated with pyridostigmine, immunotherapy, and thymectomy. Treatment is often individualized according to disease severity, antibody status, comorbidities, and other factors. This review uses a question-and-answer format to provide up-to-date, high-yield, clinically relevant information on myasthenia gravis.
With specialized care, patients with myasthenia gravis can have very good outcomes. The mainstays of treatment are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies. There is good evidence thymectomy is beneficial in thymomatous and nonthymomatous disease. Nearly all of the drugs used for MG are considered "off-label." The 2 exceptions are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and complement inhibition with eculizumab, which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for myasthenia gravis. This article reviews the evidence base and provides a framework for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, highlighting recent additions to the literature.
Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling disorder caused by impairment of the normal autonomic compensatory mechanisms that maintain upright blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic treatment is always the first step in the management of this condition, but a considerable number of patients will require pharmacologic therapies. Denervation hypersensitivity and impairment of baroreflex buffering makes these patients sensitive to small doses of pressor agents. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology can help in selecting between treatment options. In general, patients with low "sympathetic reserve", i.e., those with peripheral noradrenergic degeneration (pure autonomic failure, Parkinson's disease) and low plasma norepinephrine, tend to respond better to "norepinephrine replacers" (midodrine and droxidopa). On the other hand, patients with relatively preserved "sympathetic reserve", i.e., those with impaired central autonomic pathways but spared peripheral noradrenergic fibers (multiple system atrophy) and normal or slightly reduced plasma norepinephrine, tend to respond better to "norepinephrine enhancers" (pyridostigmine, atomoxetine, and yohimbine). There is, however, a spectrum of responses within these extremes, and treatment should be individualized. Other nonspecific treatments include fludrocortisone and octreotide. The presence of associated clinical conditions, such as supine hypertension, heart failure, postprandial hypotension, PD, MSA, and diabetes need to be considered in the pharmacologic management of these patients.
BACKGROUND: Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) may be a primary or secondary phenomenon and is often multifactorial. Treatment is largely directed at improving colonic motility. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine has been hypothesized to increase acetylcholine in the bowel, improving symptoms and transit times. METHODS: A systematic review of the use of pyridostigmine in CIPO was conducted using scientific and commercial search engines identifying scientific studies enrolling adult human subjects, published from 2000 to 2022 in the English language. RESULTS: Four studies were identified including two randomized controlled trials (RCT) and two observational studies. The studies had heterogenous inclusion criteria, dosing regimens and reported outcomes. Two studies were identified as being at high risk of bias. All studies reported improved patient outcomes with use of pyridostigmine, and low rates (4.3%) of mild cholinergic side effects. No major side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: The use of pyridostigmine in management of CIPO is biologically plausible due to its ability to increase colonic motility, and early studies on its role are uniformly suggestive of benefit with low side-effect profile. Four clinical studies have been conducted to date, with small sample sizes, heterogeneity and high risk of bias. Further high-quality studies are required to enable assessment of pyridostigmine's utility as an effective management strategy in CIPO.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute Colonic Pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is a cause of large intestinal dilation and obstruction without any physical transition point. It remains difficult to diagnose and treat. We review the recent updates on diagnosis and management of ACPO. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent guidelines have posited that conservative management can be tried in most cases of ACPO, but that early decompression and surgery should be considered. Use of neostigmine is still a viable option but there is also promising data on pyridostigmine as well as prucalopride. Resolution of ACPO should be followed by daily use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to help prevent recurrence. ACPO warrants early and accurate diagnosis with exclusion of alternate causes of large bowel dilation. Conservative management can be attempted for 48-72 h in those with cecal diameters < 12 cm and without signs of peritonitis and perforation. Early escalation of management should be attempted with neostigmine followed by endoscopy and/or surgery as needed, given that longer periods of dilation are associated with worse outcomes. There is promising new evidence for use of pyridostigmine and prucalopride, but further trials are needed prior to incorporating them into regular use. Finally, studies are lacking regarding prevention of ACPO after initial resolution.
