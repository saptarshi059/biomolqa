BACKGROUND: The optimal combination drug therapy for hypertension is not established, although current U.S. guidelines recommend inclusion of a diuretic. We hypothesized that treatment with the combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker would be more effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events than treatment with an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 11,506 patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events to receive treatment with either benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The primary end point was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. The trial was terminated early after a mean follow-up of 36 months, when the boundary of the prespecified stopping rule was exceeded. Mean blood pressures after dose adjustment were 131.6/73.3 mm Hg in the benazepril-amlodipine group and 132.5/74.4 mm Hg in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 552 primary-outcome events in the benazepril-amlodipine group (9.6%) and 679 in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (11.8%), representing an absolute risk reduction with benazepril-amlodipine therapy of 2.2% and a relative risk reduction of 19.6% (hazard ratio, 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). For the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the hazard ratio was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92; P=0.002). Rates of adverse events were consistent with those observed from clinical experience with the study drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The benazepril-amlodipine combination was superior to the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide combination in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension who were at high risk for such events.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are one of the most commonly prescribed medications and angioedema of upper aerogastric tracts is a well recognized complication. Isolated visceral angioedema with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is rare and is relatively under diagnosed. The visceral angioedema should be considered in patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors who develop gastrointestinal complaints. We report a case of subacute intestinal obstruction from the use of benazepril, which was promptly resolved after withdrawing benazepril.
A formal enantioselective synthesis of benazepril.HCl (4), an anti- hypertensive drug, is reported. Our synthesis employed an asymmetric aza-Michael addition of L-homophenylalanine ethyl ester (LHPE, 1) to 4-(2-nitrophenyl)-4-oxo- but-2-enoic acid methyl ester (6) as the key step to prepare (2S,3'S)-2-(2-oxo-2,3,4,5- tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b]azepin-3-ylamino)-4-phenylbutyric acid ethyl ester (8), which is the key intermediate leading to benazepril x HCl (4).
BACKGROUND: Acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) occur commonly after starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Whether declines in eGFR that occur after simultaneously starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with other antihypertensive agents modifies the benefits of these agents on cardiovascular outcomes is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified predictors of acute declines in eGFR (>15% over 3 months) during randomization to benazepril plus amlodipine versus benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in the ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial. We then determined the relation between declines in eGFR (treated as a binary variable, </=15% versus >15% and separately, as a restricted spline variable) and the composite risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events using Cox proportional hazards models. We included 10 714 participants (median age 68 years [Q1 63, Q3 73]), of whom 1024 reached the trial end point over median follow-up of 2.8 years. Predictors of acute declines in eGFR>15% over 3 months included assignment to hydrochlorothiazide (versus amlodipine) and higher baseline albuminuria. Overall, declines in eGFR >/=15% (versus <15%) were associated with a 26% higher hazard of cardiovascular outcomes (95% CI, 1.07-1.48). In spline-based analysis, risk for cardiovascular outcomes was higher in the hydrochlorothiazide arm at every level of decline in eGFR compared with the same magnitude of eGFR decline in the amlodipine arm. CONCLUSION: Combined use of benazepril and amlodipine remains superior to benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide for cardiovascular outcomes, regardless of the magnitude of the decline in eGFR that occurred with initiation of therapy.
The safety and efficacy of benazepril, as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, have been assessed in a number of studies, including comparative trials with the antihypertensive agents propranolol and nifedipine. These studies have included over 1300 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Comparisons of the efficacy of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination have shown that benazepril 20 mg once daily is as effective as or more effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure than hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily and that the combination of benazepril 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg has a possibly synergistic effect on diastolic blood pressure. The results of comparative trials of benazepril with propranolol and nifedipine suggest that benazepril, administered alone or with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, is as effective as the other antihypertensive agents alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. An additional study demonstrated that the combination of benazepril and nifedipine further lowered diastolic blood pressure in patients not responding to monotherapy with these agents. The safety of monotherapy with benazepril was found to be similar to that of the other antihypertensive agents. Safety of the combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide was shown to be better than that of the combination of propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide. An attenuation of adverse experiences observed during nifedipine monotherapy was obtained when benazepril was added to the nifedipine regimen.
BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent microalbuminuria in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients. We assessed whether combined therapy with the 2 medications may prevent microalbuminuria better than ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: VARIETY was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial evaluating whether, at similar blood pressure (BP) control, combined therapy with benazepril (10 mg/day) and valsartan (160 mg/day) would prevent microalbuminuria more effectively than benazepril (20 mg/day) or valsartan (320 mg/day) monotherapy in 612 type 2 diabetic patients with high-normal albuminuria included between July 2007 and April 2013 by the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS and 8 diabetology or nephrology units in Italy. Time to progression to microalbuminuria was the primary outcome. Analyses were intention to treat. Baseline characteristics were similar among groups. During a median [interquartile range, IQR] follow-up of 66 [42 to 83] months, 53 patients (27.0%) on combination therapy, 57 (28.1%) on benazepril, and 64 (31.8%) on valsartan reached microalbuminuria. Using an accelerated failure time model, the estimated acceleration factors were 1.410 (95% CI: 0.806 to 2.467, P = 0.229) for benazepril compared to combination therapy, 0.799 (95% CI: 0.422 to 1.514, P = 0.492) for benazepril compared to valsartan, and 1.665 (95% CI: 1.007 to 2.746, P = 0.047) for valsartan compared to combination therapy. Between-group differences in estimated acceleration factors were nonsignificant after adjustment for predefined confounders. BP control was similar across groups. All treatments were safe and tolerated well, with a slight excess of hyperkalemia and hypotension in the combination therapy group. The main study limitation was the lower than expected albuminuria at inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Risk/benefit profile of study treatments was similar. Dual renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade is not recommended as compared to benazepril or valsartan monotherapy for prevention of microalbuminuria in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients.

The non-sulfhydryl selective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril (20 mg daily) was compared with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily) in post-infarction (6-24 months) patients with symptomatic (NYHA functional class 2) mild heart failure. No concomitant drug therapy was given. The study had a double-blind cross-over design with 3-month treatment periods. Both drugs were well tolerated, and both caused a similar reduction in systolic blood pressure. Heart rate was higher with the diuretic. Benazepril improved the NYHA functional class in 17 out of 29 (59%) patients, whereas one patient improved with hydrochlorothiazide (P = 0.0004). With regard to global efficacy score, benazepril was also superior. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be superior to diuretics as first-choice therapy in symptomatic mild heart failure.
