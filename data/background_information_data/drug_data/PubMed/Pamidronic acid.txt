Zoledronic acid (zoledronate) is a new generation bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast bone resorption. It was much more potent than other bisphosphonates at inhibiting 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced hypercalcaemia in a rat model and calcium release in vitro. A single 5-minute intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid (4 or 8 mg) was significantly more effective than a 2-hour infusion of pamidronic acid (pamidronic acid disodium, pamidronate disodium) [90 mg] in normalising serum calcium levels in patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy and resulted in a significantly longer median time to relapse (pooled analysis from 2 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials). There were no differences in tolerability between zoledronic acid and pamidronic acid in comparative trials; the most common events in pivotal trials were fever, anaemia, nausea, constipation and dyspnoea. Fever, hypophosphataemia and hypocalcaemia were the most common events in a small phase I trial.
OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) may be triggered by intravenous bisphosphonates (IVBPs) such as zoledronic acid or pamidronic acid. Our objective was to confirm the association between AF and IVBPs in a real-life large pharmacovigilance database. DESIGN: A systematic analysis of VigiBase, the World Health Organization's pharmacovigilance database. METHODS: Analysis of adverse events reported as 'atrial fibrillation' (according to the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities) associated with the use of zoledronic acid or pamidronic acid, in VigiBase, the World Health Organization's global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database. All ICSRs reporting AF associated with zoledronic acid or pamidronic acid were included in a disproportionality analysis determining the lower end of the 95% credibility interval for the information component (IC025), showing a statistical association when >0. RESULTS: 530 ICSRs reporting on the association between AF and IVBPs were extracted. Bayesian disproportionality analysis detected a significant association between AF and use of zoledronic acid (IC025 = 1.83) and pamidronic acid (IC025 = 2.16). Further analysis of these ICSRs determined that AF was severe in 85.0% of cases and with a mortality of 17.7%. The risk of severe AF was increased (OR: 2.98 (95% CI: 1.17-7.57), P = 0.02) following zoledronic acid vs pamidronic acid, after adjustment for age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first VigiBase pharmacoepidemiological study confirming the association between IVBPs and AF. Most AF were severe, with a high frequency of lethal outcome. The risk of severe AF was increased following zoledronic acid use compared to pamidronic acid, advocating for a cautious use of IVBPs.
Bisphosphonates are osteoclast inhibitors, currently being used in oncology to prevent or delay bone morbidity in cancer. Oral and intravenous formulations of bisphosphonates have been found to be efficacious in preventing skeletal-related events such as bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia of malignancy, in patients with bone metastatic breast cancer. Bisphosphonates are also used to prevent bone loss associated with anti-estrogen therapy using aromatase inhibitors. In addition to its role in preventing bone resorption, several pre-clinical studies have noted an anti-tumor role as well. Recent research effort has particularly focused on investigating an adjuvant role for bisphosphonates in early breast cancer. Recently, few randomized trials have found a beneficial effect for adjuvant use of the aminobisphosphonate, zoledronate, in older patients who are post-menopausal. This review article will summarize the various clinical studies investigating the role of bisphosphonates in breast cancer.
[(18)F]sodium fluoride ([(18)F]NaF) is recognised to be superior to [(99)mTc]-methyl diphosphate ([(99m)Tc]Tc-MDP) and 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) in bone imaging. However, there is concern that [(18)F]NaF uptake is not cancer-specific, leading to a higher number of false-positive interpretations. Therefore, in this work, [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-pamidronic acid was prepared, optimised, and tested for its in vitro uptake. NOTA-pamidronic acid was prepared by an N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester strategy and validated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). Radiolabeling of [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-pamidronic acid was optimised, and it was ensured that all quality control analysis requirements for the radiopharmaceuticals were met prior to the in vitro cell uptake studies. NOTA-pamidronic acid was successfully prepared and radiolabeled with (18)F. The radiolabel was prepared in a 1:1 molar ratio of aluminium chloride (AlCl(3)) to NOTA-pamidronic acid and heated at 100  degrees C for 15 min in the presence of 50% ethanol (v/v), which proved to be optimal. The preliminary in vitro results of the binding of the hydroxyapatite showed that [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-pamidronic acid was as sensitive as [(18)F]sodium fluoride ([(18)F]NaF). Normal human osteoblast cell lines (hFOB 1.19) and human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2) were used for the in vitro cellular uptake studies. It was found that [(18)F]NaF was higher in both cell lines, but [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-pamidronic acid showed promising cellular uptake in Saos-2. The preliminary results suggest that further preclinical studies of [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-pamidronic acid are needed before it is transferred to clinical research.
Continuous oral pamidronate (APD), 1000 mg/day, was administered to 14 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A control group of 13 patients with similar conditions received placebo under a double blind randomized study design. Periarticular erosion scores were significantly higher in the control group after 12 months treatment. This was attributed to a deterioration in this group rather than to an improvement in the APD treated one. By contrast, intraarticular narrowing score was not influenced by APD. Tolerance to oral APD was acceptable in all patients.
