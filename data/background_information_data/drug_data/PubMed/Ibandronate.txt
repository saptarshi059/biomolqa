The adverse events of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are reviewed. Oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate and ibandronate), mainly used for the treatment of osteoporosis, have been associated with adverse events from the upper gastrointestinal tract, acute phase response, hypocalcaemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, musculoskeletal pain, osteonecrosis of the jaw and ocular events. Intravenous bisphosphonates (pamidronate, ibandronate and zoledronic acid), used in oncology and for the treatment of osteoporosis, have been associated with all the above adverse events, except those from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, pamidronate and zoledronic acid have been associated with renal toxicity. Association of bisphosphonates with atrial fibrillation and atypical fractures of the femoral diaphysis remains uncertain. There are a few case reports relating bisphosphonates to cutaneous reactions, oral ulcerations, hepatitis and esophageal cancer. Generally, intravenous are more potent than oral bisphosphonates and the frequency and severity of some of the bisphosphonate- associated adverse events are dose and potency dependent.
In rare cases, bisphosphonates are well established to cause ocular inflammation, presenting as uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis, orbital inflammation, and/or conjunctivitis. Some reports of bisphosphonate-associated neuro-ophthalmic complications also exist. We identified 101 reports in the literature relating to bisphosphonate-associated ocular complications. In a great majority of cases, symptoms resolve after discontinuation of the drug and anti-inflammatory treatment. Many cases recur if rechallenged with the same bisphosphonate. First-generation nonamino bisphosphonates, including clodronate and etidronate, are not associated with ocular inflammation. Only 2nd- and 3rd-generation amino bisphosphonates, including pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate are associated with these complications. The mechanism of bisphosphonate-induced ocular inflammation may be related to activation of gamma/delta T cells or M1 macrophages. Intravenous forms, such as pamidronate and zoledronate, tend to have higher rates and faster onset of ocular inflammation, generally presenting within days of infusion. In oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate and risedronate, these complications present with more sporadic timing. Rates of complications are also higher when bisphosphonates are used for malignancy, as doses tend to be higher compared with doses for osteoporosis.
Less than 25 years ago tumor-induced hypercalcemia was often a lethal complication of cancer. Nowadays, it can be treated easily and successfully in at least 90% of cases by volume repletion in addition to the use of bisphosphonates that are potent anti-osteoclastic compounds. The standard therapy consists of the administration of 90 mg pamidronate or, more recently, 4 mg zoledronic acid, a more efficient bisphosphonate. When available, another alternative bisphosphonate is ibandronate. Recurrent hypercalcemia is nevertheless difficult to control and antibodies against parathyroid hormone-related protein could be useful for that matter in selected patients who are not in the terminal stage of their disease. Prevention of tumor-induced hypercalcemia is one of the objectives of long-term therapy with bisphosphonates in patients with tumor bone disease. The use of bisphosphonates in placebo-controlled trials has shown that the incidence of hypercalcemic episodes is reduced by more than one half.
Bisphosphonates have become a standard treatment for osteoporosis and malignant bone disease. Most are contraindicated in severe renal insufficiency because they are eliminated exclusively by the kidneys. However, the marked impairment of bone metabolism in many dialysis patients provides a rationale for their judicious use in this setting. Animal studies reveal that bisphosphonates inhibit hyperparathyroid bone changes. Clodronate, pamidronate and ibandronate are also readily dialyzable, enabling them to be used in dialysis patients. Initial pilot studies in dialysis patients have confirmed the positive effect on hyperparathyroid bone disease observed in animal models. However, large randomized placebo-controlled trials are required before the use of bisphosphonates in renal osteopathy can be generally recommended.
The diagnosis threshold of osteoporosis is based on low bone density value. The therapeutic threshold is modulated by clinical risk factors. Denosumad, an antibody raised against RANK-Ligand, is a potent bone resorption inhibitor. Efficacy on the reduction of fracture incidence is well documented with 800 IU of vitamin D and 1 g of calcium per day. Tibolone (Livial) prevents vertebral fractures but increases strokes. Strontium ranelate (Protelos) prevents fractures over 5 years duration even in women older than 80. Native parathormone (84AA) (Preotac), reduces vertebral fractures. Alendronate (Fosavance), monthly oral and trimonthly i.v. Ibandronate (Bonviva) are the new possibilities of treatment with bisphosphonates. Yearly i.v. zoledronate injections prevent any kind of osteoporotic fractures.
