AIMS: Intravenous procainamide and amiodarone are drugs of choice for well-tolerated ventricular tachycardia. However, the choice between them, even according to Guidelines, is unclear. We performed a multicentre randomized open-labelled study to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous procainamide and amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS complex (probably ventricular) tachycardia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous procainamide (10 mg/kg/20 min) or amiodarone (5 mg/kg/20 min). The primary endpoint was the incidence of major predefined cardiac adverse events within 40 min after infusion initiation. Of 74 patients included, 62 could be analysed. The primary endpoint occurred in 3 of 33 (9%) procainamide and 12 of 29 (41%) amiodarone patients (odd ratio, OR = 0.1; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.03-0.6; P = 0.006). Tachycardia terminated within 40 min in 22 (67%) procainamide and 11 (38%) amiodarone patients (OR = 3.3; 95% CI 1.2-9.3; P = 0.026). In the following 24 h, adverse events occurred in 18% procainamide and 31% amiodarone patients (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.15-1.61; P: 0.24). Among 49 patients with structural heart disease, the primary endpoint was less common in procainamide patients (3 [11%] vs. 10 [43%]; OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.73, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: This study compares for the first time in a randomized design intravenous procainamide and amiodarone for the treatment of the acute episode of sustained monomorphic well-tolerated (probably) ventricular tachycardia. Procainamide therapy was associated with less major cardiac adverse events and a higher proportion of tachycardia termination within 40 min.
Intravenous infusion of sodium-channel blockers (SCB) with either ajmaline, flecainide, procainamide, or pilsicainide to unmask the ECG of Brugada syndrome is the drug challenge most commonly used for diagnostic purposes when investigating cases possibly related to inherited arrhythmia syndromes. For a patient undergoing an SCB challenge, the impact of a positive result goes well beyond its diagnostic implications. It is, therefore, appropriate to question who should undergo a SCB test to diagnose or exclude Brugada syndrome and, perhaps more importantly, who should not. We present a critical review of the benefits and drawbacks of the SCB challenge when performed in cardiac arrest survivors, patients presenting with syncope, family members of probands with confirmed Brugada syndrome, and asymptomatic patients with suspicious ECG.
We describe a case of procainamide-induced respiratory failure in a myasthenic patient with no prior history of respiratory weakness. Respiratory failure was induced secondary to procainamide alone since no N-acetyl-procainamide level was detectable. The patient's strength rapidly improved and he was successfully extubated 12 h after the offending dose.
Malignant melanoma has an aggressive nature and a high metastatic propensity resulting in the highest mortality rate of any skin cancer. In this study, we synthesized (18)F-labeled procainamide (PCA) for detection of melanoma using positron emission tomography (PET), and evaluated its biological characteristics. The non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield of (18)F-PCA was 10-15% and its in vitro stability was over 98% for 2 h. At 1 h, cellular uptake of (18)F-PCA was 3.8-fold higher in a group with the presence of l-tyrosine than in a non-l-tyrosine-treated group. Furthermore, (18)F-PCA permitted visualization of B16F10 (mouse melanoma) xenografts on microPET after intravenous injection, and was retained in the tumor for 60 min, with a high tumor-to-liver uptake ratio. (18)F-PCA showed specific melanoma uptake in primary lesions with a high melanin targeting ability in small animal models. (18)F-PCA may have potential as a PET imaging agent for direct melanoma detection.
A 42-year-old male developed thrombocytopenia and anemia along with agranulocytosis during treatment with procainamide. Bone marrow hypoplasia was evident on biopsy, and the patient was without evidence of systemic lupus erythematosis. He had prompt marrow recovery on drug withdrawal. While procainamide-induced agranulocytosis has been reported on a number of occasions, this is only the second case of pancytopenia.
