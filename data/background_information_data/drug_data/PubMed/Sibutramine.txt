Whereas several drugs to treat most other chronic conditions have been developed over the last 30 years, progress in pharmacologic therapy for obesity has been slow. The record of drug treatment for obesity partly explains this phenomenon and is of concern. Several compounds have been withdrawn when severe side effects have been discovered. The lack of scientifically developed safe and effective antiobesity drugs has opened the gates for an enormous number of commercial products that make vast sums of money, but have no scientific evidence backing their efficacy. This pattern is seen in both developed and developing countries. summarizes some of the presently accepted, scientifically evaluated antiobesity drugs. At present, orlistat and sibutramine are the only two major drugs used almost worldwide.
There is evidence that drugs altering food intake such as dexfenfluramine, sibutramine and orlistat have useful therapeutic effects, with an acceptable side effect profile. 'Thermogenic' drugs, such as ephedrine and caffeine, are also effective, but less well tolerated and may, in any case, work by producing anorexia. The state of drug treatment for obesity now is similar to the early days of antihypertensive treatment in the 1960s when reserpine, ganglion blockers and nonselective adrenergic blocker were all that was available. There is considerable reason for optimism that the next 10 years will bring better treatments for the obese.
The current obesity pandemic imposes a major global disease burden. However, sustained weight loss of between 5 and 10% in the obese confers marked health benefits. Currently available pharmacotherapies, orlistat and sibutramine, can induce weight loss of between 5 and 10% over 2 years or more. However, in these trials, drug induced weight loss tends to be only 2-4 kg greater than that produced by placebo control. Despite this, in the XENDOS trial, the modest placebo-subtract weight loss produced by orlistat (2.8 kg) reduced the incidence of diabetes by over a third. Recent data on the potential anti-obesity drug rimonabant are also reviewed.
There is increasing evidence that body weight is homeostatically regulated and that in obesity this regulation maintains weight at a high level. Weight loss activates mechanisms that are designed to return individuals to their pre-existing weight. This explains the universally poor results of current strategies to maintain weight loss. On this basis, life-long drug therapy may be justified for those with significant obesity. Currently available drugs include selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine), noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitors (e.g., phentermine), a serotonin and noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitor (sibutramine) and an intestinal lipase inhibitor (orlistat). An active research program is underway to develop new agents based on the rapidly expanding knowledge of the complex mechanisms regulating body weight. Leptin, a hormone produced by adipocytes that inhibits food intake, has undergone clinical trials and analogues are currently being developed. Other agents include amylin, melanocortin-4 receptor agonists, neuropeptide Y antagonists, beta(3) adrenergic agonists and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists. As some redundancy exists in the central regulatory system controlling body weight, some agents might need to be used in combination to be effective.
When prevention fails, medicinal treatment of obesity may become a necessity. Any strategic medicinal development must recognize that obesity is a chronic, stigmatized and costly disease that is increasing in prevalence. Because obesity can rarely be cured, treatment strategies are effective only as long as they are used, and combined therapy may be more effective than monotherapy. For a drug to have significant impact on body weight it must ultimately reduce energy intake, increase energy expenditure, or both. Currently approved drugs for long-term treatment of obesity include sibutramine, which inhibits food intake, and orlistat, which blocks fat digestion.
