Oral psoriasis therapies include both older traditional immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin, as well as newer, more targeted agents, such as apremilast, deucravacitinib, and oral interleukin-23 receptor antagonists. Patients may prefer oral therapies to injectable therapies based on the route of administration. Both older and newer oral psoriasis therapies can be utilized effectively in the treatment of psoriasis. Here, we will review oral agents used in the treatment of psoriasis as well as provide commentary on their role in our current, evolving psoriasis treatment paradigm.
Psoriasis is a clinically heterogeneous lifelong skin disease that presents in multiple forms such as plaque, flexural, guttate, pustular or erythrodermic. An estimated 60 million people have psoriasis worldwide, with 1.52% of the general population affected in the UK. An immune-mediated inflammatory disease, psoriasis has a major genetic component. Its association with psoriatic arthritis and increased rates of cardiometabolic, hepatic and psychological comorbidity requires a holistic and multidisciplinary care approach. Psoriasis treatments include topical agents (vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids), phototherapy (narrowband ultraviolet B radiation (NB-UVB) and psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA)), standard systemic (methotrexate, ciclosporin and acitretin), biologic (tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23 inhibitors) or small molecule inhibitor (dimethyl fumarate and apremilast) therapies. Advances in the understanding of its pathophysiology have led to development of highly effective and targeted treatments.
Pseudoporphyria is a photosensitive bullous disease, which resembles porphyria cutanea tarda. Normal porphyrin levels in urine, stool and blood define pseudoporphyria. Pseudoporphyria is associated with chronic renal failure, haemodialysis, a variety of drugs (e.g. naproxen, nabumetone, furosemide, ciprofloxacin, voriconazole, acitretin), tanning beds and UVA exposure. Treatment consists of UV protection and cessation of suspected agents. Patients in haemodialysis can benefit from treatment with N-acetylcysteine or glutathione.
Acitretin over the last 20 years has proven useful in a number of dermatologic diseases. Evidence of efficacy, side-effect profile, and approach to its use will be reviewed.
Acitretin, an active metabolite of etretinate, is the most widely used systemic retinoid in the treatment of psoriasis. There are several unique characteristics of this drug, which set it apart from other options in the therapeutic armamentarium of psoriasis. It is highly efficacious as monotherapy in some specific clinical subtypes of psoriasis. It has dose-sparing effects when used as combination therapy with conventional systemic drugs as well as the biologics. It is a good option for long-term maintenance therapy. Side effects are common but usually mild and can be managed by its proper dosing and monitoring. With appropriate patient selection, gradual dose escalation, and patient counseling, we can deliver good results in psoriasis with this useful drug. This review gives a comprehensive recount of acitretin use in the present era of biologics in psoriasis.
