Acid-catalysed O-acetylation of D-maltulose furnished the corresponding per-O-acetylated fructopyranose derivative that, after in situ deprotection at O-2 by reaction with triphenylphosphane dibromide, gave open-chain 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-1,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-6-bromo-6-deoxy-D-fructose. Standard deprotection employing sodium methoxide in methanol at -30 degrees C, followed by treatment of the resulting free 6-bromodeoxymaltulose with sodium azide in N,N-dimethylformamide, allowed access to 6-azidodeoxymaltulose. Hydrogenation over Pearlman's catalyst, accompanied by intramolecular reductive amination, yielded the desired title compound. This route allows access to preparative quantities and to a range of novel analogues with improved biostability.
Nonenzymic browning reactions in commercial infant formulas were evaluated through their furosine content as well as the isomeric disaccharides formed during processing. Lactulose was observed only in samples containing appreciable amounts of lactose, whereas maltulose was present in all samples due to the isomerization of maltose. Because formation of maltulose depends on the initial amount of maltose present, the ratio maltose/maltulose was used for comparative purposes. The ratio maltose/maltulose varied within a wide range, 27-167; therefore, low values in maltose/maltulose ratio may indicate severe processing conditions during manufacture, whereas high values may indicate mild processing conditions. Variable amounts of furosine content in samples with similar maltose/maltulose ratios may be attributed to different conditions used during storage. Levels of furosine higher than those reported for milk powder were detected in most studied samples. Determination of both furosine and maltose/maltulose ratio would yield information retrospectively about the heat treatment applied during processing and the storage conditions of commercial infant formula.
Spores of the fungus Myrothecium verrucaria are cryptic to maltose and isomaltose. Induction of a transport system can be effected by several sugars whose order of effectiveness is: turanose > maltulose > sucrose > d-arabinose, d-fructose, nigerose, maltotriulose, kestose > melezitose, raffinose, nystose, and stachyose. The transport system is not specific to maltose and isomaltose, and it is apparently identical to an induced trehalose permease described previously. Induction of the permease is markedly influenced by spore age-older spores being more responsive. Pure maltose is not absorbed by spores. Absorption of commercial reagent-grade maltose is due to permease induction by maltulose as an impurity. Maltulose contamination of maltose was demonstrated by charcoal column chromatography and comparison of its physical, chemical, and permease-inductive properties with those of authentic maltulose. Maltose accumulates temporarily in spores after absorption and then decreases, although no conversion to glucose can be detected. Although spores contain small quantities of maltase, metabolism of maltose may be via some nonhydrolytic pathway.
