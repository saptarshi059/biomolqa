We present the case of 38-year-old woman who experienced palpitations on swallowing, which were later found to be atrial fibrillation. Her symptoms improved on treatment with disopyramide and verapamil. Within 9 months, she was weaned from both medications without recurrence of symptoms.
In patients with renal insufficiency roxithromycin pharmacokinetic parameters are significantly altered. In particular, the Cmax, the AUC and the T1/2 are increased and the Clr is reduced. In alcoholic cirrhotic patients the blood half-life is dosage higher than in normals. In spite of this, in these types of patients the usual roxithromycin dosage should not be modified. Potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions that involve roxithromycin are very few and concern only disopyramide and theophylline. Theophylline concentrations should be monitored if the pretreatment blood level is greater than 15 mg/l.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) occurs in 1 in 500 individuals. Treatment options for HCM differ from those administered in coronary disease, heart failure, and valvular disease patients that comprise the core of many cardiology practices. In this article, we offer a concise summary of the therapeutic use of disopyramide for reducing gradients and relieving symptoms in obstructive HCM.
Disopyramide (Norpace) is a recently released antiarrhythmic agent with quinidine-like actions, but structurally unique. We describe a patient in whom impressive hypoglycemia developed following treatment with this agent. Blood glucose levels returned to normal after cessation of therapy, but dropped again following rechallenge with the drug. The pathogenesis of the hypoglycemia was investigated by assessment of serum insulin, plasma glucagon and serum alanine levels during disopyramide rechallenge. Clinicians should be aware of fasting hypoglycemia as an unusual but potentially serious complication of disopyramide therapy.
The present status, clinical experience, side effects, clinical pharmacology and electrophysiologic actions of seven new antiarrhythmic agents are reviewed. The drugs selected for comment are amiodarone, aprindine, disopyramide, ethmozin, mexiletine, tocainide and verapamil. Each drug has been shown to have clinical efficacy in suppressing cardiac arrhythmias.
