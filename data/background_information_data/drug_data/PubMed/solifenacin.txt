bladder based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis approach. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials databases were systematically searched. The search time frame was from database creation to June 2, 2022. Randomized controlled double-blind trials of oral medication for overactive bladder were screened against the protocol's entry criteria. Trials were evaluated for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, and data were statistically analyzed using Stata 16.0 software. RESULT: A total of 60 randomized controlled double-blind clinical trials were included involving 50,333 subjects. Solifenacin 10mg was the most effective in mean daily micturitions and incontinence episodes, solifenacin 5/10mg in mean daily urinary urgency episodes and nocturia episodes, fesoterodine 8mg in urgency incontinence episodes/d and oxybutynin 5mg in voided volume/micturition. In terms of safety, solifenacin 5mg, ER-tolterodine 4mg, mirabegron, vibegron and ER-oxybutynin 10mg all showed a better incidence of dry mouth, fesoterodine 4mg, ER-oxybutynin 10mg, tolterodine 2mg, and vibegron in the incidence of constipation. Compared to placebo, imidafenacin 0.1mg showed a significantly increased incidence in hypertension, solifenacin 10mg in urinary tract infection, fesoterodine 4/8mg and darifenacin 15mg in headache. CONCLUSION: Solifenacin showed better efficacy. For safety, most anticholinergic drugs were more likely to cause dry mouth and constipation, lower doses were better tolerated. The choice of drugs should be tailored to the patient's specific situation to find the best balance between efficacy and safety.
The literature data on the urgent neurological problem - overactive bladder (OAB) are summarized. The OAB prevalence, current conceptions on the physiology and pathophysiology of urination and pathogenetic mechanisms of OAB development are presented. Main groups of pharmacological agents used in OAB treatment are described. Special attention is drawn to rationale of using anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) drugs. The authors present the results of their own comparative analysis on the efficacy and tolerability of these drugs in treatment of patients with cerebral vascular diseases including the use of solifenacin succinate (VESIcare).
Several studies with modern antimuscarinics have used a flexible-dosing strategy. We reviewed data from several studies with solifenacin, darifenacin and oxybutynin extended-release that evaluated the impact of dose flexibility on clinical management. A strategy based on patient-requested dose increases was found to be consistently effective in improving the symptoms of overactive bladder. Patients requesting a dose increase often had more severe symptoms at baseline than those who did not request a dose increase, and these patients derived most benefit from the increased dose. Specialists and family doctors should encourage open discussion with their patients about requesting dose titration so as to meet patients' individual needs.

Antimuscarinics are the drugs of choice for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome, and their benefit/risk ratio depends largely on selectivity for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptors. Solifenacin is the antimuscarinic that presents greatest selectivity for M3 bladder receptors, which may translate into a lower incidence of undesirable effects related to other receptor subtypes. Metabolic pathways of the antimuscarinics may impact efficacy and appearance of interactions. Solifenacin is metabolized only by the CYP3A4, giving three inactive metabolites and one with a similar activity to the original compound. However, other drugs in the group are also a substrate for the CYP 2D6 which presents polymorphisms, whereby their pharmacokinetics may be modified in slow metabolizers. The risk of interactions of solifenacin is low, and it is lower than that of the antimuscarinics which are also metabolized by the CYP 2D6. The unaltered fraction of solifenacin which is eliminated in urine, together with the active metabolite, can contribute to the therapeutic effect by acting on the urothelium receptors. It is not necessary to adjust doses of solifenacin in elderly patients or those with moderate liver or kidney impairment.
