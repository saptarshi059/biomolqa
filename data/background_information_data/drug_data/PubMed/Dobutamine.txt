The report describes a patient during induction of anaesthesia for coronary artery by-pass grafting, in whom the infusion of dobutamine at a rate of 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 resulted in unanticipated severe hypertension. The exaggerated response may be attributed to cimetidine--dobutamine interaction.
Takotsubo syndrome is a potentially reversible cause of acute systolic dysfunction. Takotsubo syndrome is rare in children, with no reported dobutamine-induced cases to date. We present a 14-year-old male with prior history of heart transplantation, who developed Takotsubo syndrome during dobutamine stress echocardiography. We highlight the importance of its early recognition to ensure supportive measures with avoidance of inotropic medications.
A man with dilated cardiomyopathy presented with decompensated heart failure and marked eosinophilia. After extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation for hypereosinophilic syndrome, including a myocardial biopsy, it was determined by means of rechallenge (second dobutamine infusion) that the patient was afflicted with dobutamine-induced eosinophilia. This report is important because of the high utilization rate of this drug in a sick population. Simply discontinuing it or switching to another agent can avert the high cost and risk of the evaluation for hypereosinophilic syndrome in this compromised group of patients.
Myocardial bridges are common and often benign, but can cause hemodynamically significant obstruction of blood flow with stress. Dobutamine stress positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a powerful tool for non-invasively assessing for ischemia. We present a case of using dobutamine stress PET/CT to determine the significance of a myocardial bridge.
Controversy surrounds the assessment of perfusion and the methods currently utilised to define hypotension, especially blood pressure. There is growing agreement to assess heart function when selecting inotropic therapy and use bedside tools such as echocardiography for assessing at-risk infants. Both dopamine and dobutamine have comparative efficacy, and in certain disease states with immature myocardium there could be potential advantages in using dobutamine. The concomitant use of hydrocortisone has been shown to be beneficial when escalating doses of first-line inotropes are used. Other inotropes require further study through randomised trials for their safety and efficacy to be established.
