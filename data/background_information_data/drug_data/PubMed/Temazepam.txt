There is a discrepancy between the recommendation for caution and daily practice in the prescription of benzodiazepines. Although there is heterogeneity in the registered indications, all benzodiazepine agonists have almost the same mechanism of action. There are, however, substantial pharmacokinetic differences between individual benzodiazepine agonists. During short-term use of benzodiazepines, the elimination half-life is no measure of duration of action. Benzodiazepine lipophilicity determines the speed of action. If a rapid effect is desired, for instance in acute anxiety or agitation, then regarding oral medication the use of a lipophilic benzodiazepine such as diazepam is a rational choice. An accumulation factor can be used to estimate benzodiazepine accumulation during chronic use. In theory, accumulation does not occur with once-daily dosage of benzodiazepines that have an elimination half-life markedly shorter than 24 h, such as oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam.
Chronic insomnia affects 57% of the elderly in the United States, with impairment of quality of life, function, and health. Chronic insomnia burdens society with billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs of care. The main modalities in the treatment of insomnia in the elderly are psychological/behavioral therapies, pharmacological treatment, or a combination of both. Various specialty societies view psychological/behavioral therapies as the initial treatment intervention. Pharmacotherapy plays an adjunctive role when insomnia symptoms persist or when patients are unable to pursue cognitive behavioral therapies. Current drugs for insomnia fall into different classes: orexin agonists, histamine receptor antagonists, non-benzodiazepine gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, and benzodiazepines. This review focuses on Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for insomnia, including suvorexant, low-dose doxepin, Z-drugs (eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon), benzodiazepines (triazolam, temazepam), and ramelteon. We review the indications, dosing, efficacy, benefits, and harms of these drugs in the elderly, and discuss data on drugs that are commonly used off-label to treat insomnia, and those that are in clinical development. The choice of a hypnotic agent in the elderly is symptom-based. Ramelteon or short-acting Z-drugs can treat sleep-onset insomnia. Suvorexant or low-dose doxepin can improve sleep maintenance. Eszopiclone or zolpidem extended release can be utilized for both sleep onset and sleep maintenance. Low-dose zolpidem sublingual tablets or zaleplon can alleviate middle-of-the-night awakenings. Benzodiazepines should not be used routinely. Trazodone, a commonly used off-label drug for insomnia, improves sleep quality and sleep continuity but carries significant risks. Tiagabine, sometimes used off-label for insomnia, is not effective and should not be utilized. Non-FDA-approved hypnotic agents that are commonly used include melatonin, diphenhydramine, tryptophan, and valerian, despite limited data on benefits and harms. Melatonin slightly improves sleep onset and sleep duration, but product quality and efficacy may vary. Tryptophan decreases sleep onset in adults, but data in the elderly are not available. Valerian is relatively safe but has equivocal benefits on sleep quality. Phase II studies of dual orexin receptor antagonists (almorexant, lemborexant, and filorexant) have shown some improvement in sleep maintenance and sleep continuity. Piromelatine may improve sleep maintenance. Histamine receptor inverse agonists (APD-125, eplivanserin, and LY2624803) improve slow-wave sleep but, for various reasons, the drug companies withdrew their products.
Sleep complaints are common in the elderly, and are often related to physiological changes with ageing, or secondary to illness and drug therapy. Primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnoea and movement disorders, are also common. Management should be specific to the problem. Attention to underlying factors and sleep hygiene, as well as reassurance and education about age-related sleep changes, will often be sufficient. Hypnotics, which usually offer only temporary symptomatic relief, may be counterproductive, and should be prescribed only in the short term, except in limited specific cases. Short-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam or oxazepam), or possibly zopiclone, are currently the drugs of choice.
In an unrandomised uncontrolled study on boats and trains, capsules of flurazepam (30 mg) and temazepam (20 mg), when chewed, but not when swallowed whole (even with the ends pricked), gave a better night's sleep than 'Mandrax' (methaqualone 250 mg/diphenhydramine 50 mg) and a better night's sleep than nitrazepam 7.5 mg.
This review aims at providing a critical assessment of the effects of the most widely used benzodiazepine (flurazepam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, triazolam) and non-benzodiazepine (zopiclone and zolpidem) hypnotic drugs, based on the recording of polysomnographic variables. In the light of newly acquired neurophysiological data on the microstructure of sleep, this paper reconsiders the problem of insomnia and the current ideas on polysomnography and hypnotic drugs.
