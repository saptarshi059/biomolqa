BACKGROUND & AIMS: For decades, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been the mainstay of treatment for erosive esophagitis. The potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan provides more potent acid inhibition than PPIs, but data on its efficacy for erosive esophagitis are limited. METHODS: Adults with erosive esophagitis were randomized to once-daily vonoprazan, 20 mg, or lansoprazole, 30 mg, for up to 8 weeks. Patients with healing were rerandomized to once-daily vonoprazan, 10 mg, vonoprazan, 20 mg, or lansoprazole, 15 mg, for 24 weeks. Primary end points, percentage with healing by week 8 endoscopy, and maintenance of healing at week 24 endoscopy, were assessed in noninferiority comparisons (noninferiority margins, 10%), with superiority analyses prespecified if noninferiority was demonstrated. Analyses of primary and secondary end points were performed using fixed-sequence testing procedures. RESULTS: Among 1024 patients in the healing phase, vonoprazan was noninferior to lansoprazole in the primary analysis and superior on the exploratory analysis of healing (92.9 vs 84.6%; difference, 8.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5%-12.2%). Secondary analyses showed vonoprazan was noninferior in heartburn-free days (difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, -1.6% to 7.0%), and superior in healing Los Angeles Classification Grade C/D esophagitis at week 2 (difference, 17.6%; 95% CI, 7.4%-27.4%). Among 878 patients in the maintenance phase, vonoprazan was noninferior to lansoprazole in the primary analysis and superior on the secondary analysis of maintenance of healing (20 mg vs lansoprazole: difference, 8.7%; 95% CI, 1.8%-15.5%; 10 mg vs lansoprazole: difference, 7.2%; 95% CI, 0.2%-14.1%) and secondary analysis of maintenance of healing Grade C/D esophagitis (20 mg vs lansoprazole: difference, 15.7%; 95% CI, 2.5%-28.4%; 10 mg vs lansoprazole: difference, 13.3%; 95% CI, 0.02%-26.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Vonoprazan was noninferior and superior to the PPI lansoprazole in healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. This benefit was seen predominantly in more severe erosive esophagitis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04124926).
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are an antacid drug often used in acid-related disorders. They decrease acid secretion in the stomach by blocking an enzyme called H+/K+ ATPase which controls acid production. Introduced to the market in 1989, their use has increased rapidly worldwide and they are now among the top 10 most prescribed drugs in the United States. As of 2015, the FDA has already approved six drugs of this class (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole). Recently, the risks and benefits of long-term PPI use were questioned and many studies indicated that their use should be carefully considered, especially in young patients, whose treatment with these drugs could last many years. Even greater concerns have been raised about a potential positive association between PPIs and osteoporotic fracture risk including the hip, spine and wrist. Although based on observational studies, there is substantial evidence associating the long-term use of PPIs and fracture. This relationship is only partially admitted due to the lack of consistent effects of PPIs on bone mineral density loss. Therefore, this narrative review aimed to discuss the recent findings pertaining to the risk of osteoporotic fracture associated with PPIs, in particular prolonged use, and to call for further research to elucidate the mechanisms associated with this bone fragility.
BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been used for more than two decades to control symptoms of gastroesophageal illnesses. Studies have shown that most PPIs do not provide 24-h symptom control, and that can be the reason for treatment failure. Recently, dexlansoprazole dual delayed release (DDR) (Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc., USA) under the trade name of Kapidex (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Japan) came onto the market to provide longer duration of action and more effective acid suppression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the pharmacology of dexlansoprazole DDR and to provide a concise review of all available studies showing its efficacy. The combination of the slower metabolism of the R-enantiomer and novel dual release pharmacokinetics is impressive. METHODS: This manuscript is based on a review of all currently available medical literature on dexlansoprazole DDR. CONCLUSION: Dexlansoprazole DDR has the potential to outperform traditional PPIs based on the metabolism and novel pharmacokinetics. It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of erosive esophagitis (acute, maintenance) and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Novel, effective treatments for Helicobacter pylori infection are needed. This study evaluated the efficacy of vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, vs standard treatment on H pylori eradication in the United States and Europe. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial, treatment-naive adults with H pylori infection were randomized 1:1:1 to open-label vonoprazan dual therapy (20 mg vonoprazan twice daily; 1 g amoxicillin 3 times daily), or double-blind triple therapy twice a day (vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg; amoxicillin 1 g; clarithromycin 500 mg) for 14 days. The primary outcome was noninferiority in eradication rates in patients without clarithromycin- and amoxicillin-resistant strains (noninferiority margin = 10%). Secondary outcomes assessed superiority in eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections, and in all patients. RESULTS: A total of 1046 patients were randomized. Primary outcome eradication rates (nonresistant strains): vonoprazan triple therapy 84.7%, dual therapy 78.5%, vs lansoprazole triple therapy 78.8% (both noninferior; difference 5.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.8 to 12.6; P < .001; difference -0.3%; 95% CI, -7.4 to 6.8; P = .007, respectively). Eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections: vonoprazan triple therapy 65.8%, dual therapy 69.6%, vs lansoprazole triple therapy 31.9% (both superior; difference 33.9%; 95% CI, 17.7-48.1; P < .001; difference 37.7%; 95% CI, 20.5-52.6; P < .001, respectively). In all patients, vonoprazan triple and dual therapy were superior to lansoprazole triple therapy (80.8% and 77.2%, respectively, vs 68.5%, difference 12.3%; 95% CI, 5.7-18.8; P < .001; difference 8.7%; 95% CI, 1.9-15.4; P = .013). Overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between vonoprazan and lansoprazole regimens (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Both vonoprazan-based regimens were superior to proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy in clarithromycin-resistant strains and in the overall study population.

Nebivolol is a beta-1 receptor blocker used to treat hypertension, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. This review investigated the data regarding pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, drug-drug interactions, dextrorotatory (D), and levorotatory (L) stereoisomers of nebivolol. The articles related to the PK of nebivolol were retrieved by searching the five databases; Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO. A total of 20 studies comprising plasma concentration-time profile data following the nebivolol's oral and intravenous (IV) administration were included. The area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) was 15 times greater in poor metabolizers (PMs) than in extensive metabolizers (EMs). In hypertensive patients, L-nebivolol expressed a higher maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) than D-nebivolol, i.e. 2.5 ng/ml vs 1.2 ng/ml. The AUC(0-infinity) of nebivolol was 3-fold greater in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The clearance (CL) was increased in obese than in controls from 51.6 +/- 11.6 L/h to 71.6 +/- 17.4 L/h when 0.5 mg/ml IV solution was infused. Nebivolol showed higher C(max), AUC(0-infinity) and half-life (t(1/2)) when co-administered with bupropion, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, lansoprazole, and fluoxetine. This concise review of nebivolol would be advantageous in assessing all PK parameters, which may be crucial for clinicians to avoid drug-drug interactions, prevent adverse drug events and optimize the dosage regimen in diseased patients diagnosed with hypertension and cardiovascular disorders.
IMPORTANCE: The combination of ceftriaxone and lansoprazole has been shown to prolong the corrected QT interval on electrocardiogram. However, it is unknown whether this translates to clinically important patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare lansoprazole with another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) during ceftriaxone treatment in terms of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and in-hospital mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study including adult medical inpatients receiving ceftriaxone with lansoprazole or another PPI in 13 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, was conducted from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021. EXPOSURE: Lansoprazole during ceftriaxone treatment vs other PPIs during ceftriaxone treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest that occurred after hospital admission. The secondary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Propensity-score weighting was used to adjust for covariates including hospital site, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia, illness severity, admitting diagnoses, and concomitant medications. RESULTS: Of the 31 152 patients hospitalized on internal medicine wards who were treated with ceftriaxone while receiving a PPI, 16 135 patients (51.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 71.7 (16.0) years. The study included 3747 patients in the lansoprazole group and 27 405 patients in the other PPI group. Ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest occurred in 126 patients (3.4%) within the lansoprazole group and 319 patients (1.2%) within the other PPI group. In-hospital mortality occurred in 746 patients (19.9%) within the lansoprazole group and 2762 patients (10.1%) in the other PPI group. After weighting using propensity scores, the adjusted risk difference for the lansoprazole group minus other PPI group was 1.7% (95% CI, 1.1%-2.3%) for ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest and 7.4% (95% CI, 6.1%-8.8%) for in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that combination therapy with lansoprazole and ceftriaxone should be avoided. More studies are needed to determine whether these findings could be replicated in other populations and settings.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Studies on the therapeutic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have been recently published. In most of these studies, comparison of only two PPIs have been made. There are few studies on the comparison of four or more PPIs. We aimed to compare the acid inhibitory effects of esomeprazole 40 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, and pantoprazole 40 mg on days 1 and 5 of treatment in patients with GERD, who were extensive metabolizers in regard to the CYP2C19 genotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori-negative with typical symptoms of GERD patients were randomly divided into four treatment groups. Efficacy analysis on days 1 and 5 were performed on the four groups which comprised 10 (esomeprazole), 11 (rabeprazole), 10 (lansoprazole), and 10 (pantoprazole) patients. RESULTS: On day 1 of PPI treatment, the mean percentage of time with intragastric Ph>4 were 54%, 58%, 60%, and 35% for the groups, respectively, and on day 5, these values were 67%, 60%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. Esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and lansoprazole were found to be superior to pantoprazole on the first day of treatment. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole is a less potent proton pump inhibitor than the other PPIs tested on the first day of treatment. When the time needed to raise the intragatric pH to over 4 was evaluated, esomeprazole was found to have the most rapid action, followed by lansoprazole and rabeprazole.
The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the late 1980s optimised the medical treatment of acid-related disorders. They are potent medications and have a good safety profile. However, long-term therapy with PPIs may carry undesired side effects, one of which is hypomagnesaemia. This entity is likely to be under-reported. We present a clinical case which illustrates this important clinical problem. We present the case of a 73-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with supraventricular tachycardia due to hypomagnesaemia while using lansoprazole, followed by the literature review on this subject. In our patient after the intravenous magnesium replenishment, her arrhythmia resolved. After stopping her PPI her serum magnesium remained within reference values without oral supplementation. We believe that more attention towards this underdiagnosed side effect is required. Serum magnesium concentration should be checked in patients on PPIs if they are unwell or present with arrythmia.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether concomitant use of ceftriaxone and oral or intravenous lansoprazole increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest in the real-world setting in Japan. METHODS: The data analyzed were obtained from the JMDC hospital-based administrative claims database for the period April 2014 to August 2022. Patients who received a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) while receiving ceftriaxone or sulbactam/ampicillin were identified. The frequency of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest was analyzed according to whether oral or intravenous PPI was concomitant with ceftriaxone or sulbactam/ampicillin. Estimates of the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest were then compared among the groups, using the Fine-Gray competing risk regression model. RESULTS: The results showed that the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest was significantly higher with concomitant ceftriaxone and oral lansoprazole (hazard ratio 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.99-4.29, P < 0.01) or intravenous lansoprazole (hazard ratio 4.57, 95% confidence interval 1.24-16.80, P = 0.02) than with concomitant sulbactam/ampicillin and oral or intravenous lansoprazole. CONCLUSIONS: Oral and intravenous lansoprazole may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest in patients who are receiving ceftriaxone.
Dexlansoprazole MR is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole that is delivered by a novel system, the dual delayed release formulation. The drug has been shown to be efficacious in healing erosive esophagitis as compared with lansoprazole. When compared to placebo, dexlansoprazole provided significantly higher maintenance rates for healed esophageal mucosa in patients with erosive esophagitis and symptom control in patients with non-erosive reflux disease. Dexlansoprazole could be taken without regard to food. Overall, dexlansoprazole is well tolerated and has a comparable side-effect profile to lansoprazole.
BACKGROUND: VISION is a randomised, phase 4, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted in 33 centres in Japan. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term safety of vonoprazan for maintenance treatment of healed erosive oesophagitis versus lansoprazole. METHODS: Patients with endoscopically diagnosed erosive oesophagitis were randomised 2:1 to once-daily vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg, for a 4- to 8-week healing phase. Patients with endoscopically confirmed healing entered a 260-week maintenance phase with a once-daily starting dose of vonoprazan 10 mg or lansoprazole 15 mg. Primary endpoint was change in gastric mucosal histopathology. RESULTS: Of 208 patients (vonoprazan, n = 139; lansoprazole, n = 69) entering the healing phase, 202 entered the maintenance phase (vonoprazan, n = 135; lansoprazole, n = 67). At 3 years, 109 vonoprazan-treated and 58 lansoprazole-treated patients remained on treatment. Histopathological evaluation of gastric mucosa showed that hyperplasia of parietal, foveolar and G cells was more common with vonoprazan than lansoprazole at week 156 of the maintenance phase. There was no marked increase in the occurrence of parietal, foveolar and G cell hyperplasia among patients in the vonoprazan group from week 48 to week 156. Histopathological evaluation of the gastric mucosa also showed no neoplastic changes in either group. No new safety issues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis of VISION, no new safety concerns were identified in Japanese patients with healed erosive oesophagitis receiving vonoprazan or lansoprazole as maintenance treatment for 3 years. (CT.gov identifier: NCT02679508; JapicCTI-163153; Japan Registry of Clinical Trials: jRCTs031180040).
BACKGROUND: Tegoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker for the treatment of acid-related disorders. AIMS: To assess whether tegoprazan is non-inferior to lansoprazole in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with gastric ulcers. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, active control, multicentre study, 306 gastric ulcer patients were randomised to one of three treatment groups: tegoprazan 50 mg, tegoprazan 100 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for 4 or 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the cumulative proportion of patients with healed ulcers confirmed by endoscopy up to 8 weeks from treatment initiation. Symptoms and safety were assessed. RESULTS: In the full analysis set, the cumulative healing rates at week 8 were 94.8% (91/96) for the tegoprazan 50 mg, 95.0% (94/99) for the tegoprazan 100 mg and 95.7% (89/93) for the lansoprazole 30 mg groups. At week 4, the respective healing rates were 90.6% (87/96), 91.9% (91/99), and 89.2% (83/93). In per protocol analysis, 4-week healing rates were 95.4% (84/88), 94.6% (88/93) and 92.9% (79/85) for tegoprazan 50 mg, tegoprazan 100 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg, respectively. Both doses of tegoprazan were non-inferior to lansoprazole in ulcer healing at 4 and 8 weeks. The incidence of drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ among groups. The increase in serum gastrin concentration was not higher in tegoprazan-treated patients than in lansoprazole-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tegoprazan 50 or 100 mg were not inferior to lansoprazole 30 mg once daily in the treatment of gastric ulcers.
INTRODUCTION: We assessed pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a potassium-competitive acid blocker and proton pump inhibitor in US subjects. METHODS: Healthy adults were randomized to 7-day periods of vonoprazan 20 mg once daily followed by lansoprazole 30 mg once daily or the reverse order, separated by >/= 7 days of washout. RESULTS: Vonoprazan (N = 40) had higher proportions of 24-hour periods with intragastric pH > 4 than lansoprazole (N = 41,38) on day 1 (62.4% vs 22.6%, P < 0.0001) and day 7 (87.8% vs 42.3%, P < 0.0001). Separation in pH started  approximately 2.5 hours after the first dose. DISCUSSION: Vonoprazan provided more rapid and potent inhibition of intragastric acidity than lansoprazole in US subjects.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in the treatment of Asian patients with erosive oesophagitis (EO). DESIGN: In this phase III, double-blind, multicentre study, patients with endoscopically confirmed EO were randomised 1:1 to receive vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg, once daily for up to 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was EO healing rate at 8 weeks. The secondary endpoints were EO healing rates at 2 and 4 weeks. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). RESULTS: In the vonoprazan (n=238) and lansoprazole (n=230) arms, 8-week EO healing rates were 92.4% and 91.3%, respectively (difference 1.1% (95% CI -3.822% to 6.087%)). The respective 2-week EO healing rates were 75.0% and 67.8% (difference 7.2% (95% CI -1.054% to 15.371%)), and the respective 4-week EO healing rates were 85.3% and 83.5% (difference 1.8% (95% CI -4.763% to 8.395%)). In patients with baseline Los Angeles classification grade C/D, 2-week, 4-week and 8-week EO healing rates were higher with vonoprazan versus lansoprazole (2 weeks: 62.2% vs 51.5%, difference 10.6% (95% CI -5.708% to 27.002%); 4 weeks: 73.3% vs 67.2%, difference 6.2% (95% CI -8.884 to 21.223); and 8 weeks: 84.0% vs 80.6%, difference 3.4% (95% CI -9.187% to 15.993%)). Overall, EO healing rates appeared higher with vonoprazan versus lansoprazole. TEAE rates were 38.1% and 36.6% in the vonoprazan and lansoprazole group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in terms of EO healing rate at 8 weeks in this population. Safety outcomes were similar in the two treatment arms. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02388724.
Approximately 30% of patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms have endoscopic evidence of erosive esophagitis (EE).(1) The severity of EE is commonly graded using the Los Angeles (LA) classification system as grade A (minimal) to D (very severe), depending on the extent of endoscopically visible mucosal breaks (Supplementary Figure 1).(2) Accurate grading of EE severity is crucial in clinical trials of medical EE treatments, as EE severity strongly influences both initial rates of healing and the likelihood of recurrence during maintenance treatment.(3,4) Almost all EE treatment studies have relied exclusively on local investigators' grading of EE severity to determine study eligibility and response to treatment. Those few studies that included central adjudication did not assess the reliability of grading by local investigators.(5) Unlike typical studies of EE treatment, the phase III clinical trial of vonoprazan versus lansoprazole for the treatment of EE (NCT04124926) mandated central adjudication of endoscopic grading for study participation.(6) The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the rate of agreement between local investigators and central adjudicators for EE grading during screening for entrance into that clinical trial.
Dexlansoprazole modified release (dexlansoprazole MR) is an orally administered delayed-release formulation of the R-enantiomer of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole that is effective in improving the healing of all grades of erosive oesophagitis, maintaining the healing of erosive oesophagitis and in the treatment of symptomatic non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). In two large, identical, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, multicentre phase III trials, dexlansoprazole MR 60 mg once daily achieved complete healing in >or=92% of patients with all grades of erosive oesophagitis (primary endpoint) and was noninferior to lansoprazole 30 mg once daily using life-table analysis. Moreover, in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre phase III trial in patients with healed erosive oesophagitis, dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg once daily was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining healing following 6 months' treatment (primary endpoint). In addition, the proportion of 24-hour heartburn-free days (primary endpoint) was significantly greater in recipients of dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg once daily than in recipients of placebo following 4 weeks' treatment in a large, randomized, double-blind, multicentre phase III trial in patients with NERD. Dexlansoprazole MR 30 or 60 mg once daily was generally well tolerated in a pooled analysis of clinical trials of up to 12 months' duration.
An 86-year-old man was admitted with a 3-day history of melaena and syncope. He was haemodynamically compromised and anaemic on presentation. His only medical history was mild Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 6 months prior. For this, he was on donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), with a recent dose increase 3 months earlier. After fluid resuscitation with packed red cells, an endoscopy was performed, which showed an acute duodenal ulcer. This was treated with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor. The patient recovered well and was discharged on donepezil with the addition of a gastro-protective proton pump inhibitor. In view of other absent risk factors of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, donepezil was the likely causative agent. ChEIs are associated with frequent side effects and increased hospitalisation due to central and peripheral increase in acetylcholine. With this case report, we review the literature of side effects related to ChEIs, where the mechanisms of action, complications and appropriate management are discussed.
BACKGROUND: Erosive esophagitis (EE) is a gastroesophageal reflux disease characterized by mucosal breaks in the esophagus. Proton pump inhibitors are widely used as maintenance therapy for EE, but many patients still relapse. In this trial, we evaluated the noninferiority of vonoprazan vs. lansoprazole as maintenance therapy in patients with healed EE. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial among non-Japanese Asian adults with endoscopically confirmed healed EE from April 2015 to February 2019. Patients from China, South Korea, and Malaysia were randomized to vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg once daily or lansoprazole 15 mg once daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was endoscopically confirmed EE recurrence rate over 24 weeks with a noninferiority margin of 10% using a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded. RESULTS: Among 703 patients, EE recurrence was observed in 24/181 (13.3%) and 21/171 (12.3%) patients receiving vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg, respectively, and 47/184 (25.5%) patients receiving lansoprazole (differences: -12.3% [95% CI, -20.3% to -4.3%] and -13.3% [95% CI, -21.3% to -5.3%], respectively), meeting the primary endpoint of noninferiority to lansoprazole in preventing EE recurrence at 24 weeks. Evidence of superiority (upper bound of 95% CI <0%) was also observed. At 12 weeks, endoscopically confirmed EE recurrence was observed in 5/18, 2/20, and 7/20 of patients receiving vonoprazan 10 mg, vonoprazan 20 mg, and lansoprazole, respectively. TEAEs were experienced by 66.8% (157/235), 69.0% (156/226), and 65.3% (158/242) of patients receiving vonoprazan 10 mg, vonoprazan 20 mg, and lansoprazole, respectively. The most common TEAE was upper respiratory tract infection in 12.8% (30/235) and 12.8% (29/226) patients in vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg groups, respectively and 8.7% (21/242) patients in lansoprazole group. CONCLUSION: Vonoprazan maintenance therapy was well-tolerated and noninferior to lansoprazole for preventing EE recurrence in Asian patients with healed EE. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02388737.
BACKGROUND: Vonoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker which may provide clinical benefit in acid-related disorders. AIM: To verify the non-inferiority of vonoprazan vs. lansoprazole in patients with erosive oesophagitis (EE), and to establish its long-term safety and efficacy as maintenance therapy. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparison study, patients with endoscopically confirmed EE (LA Classification Grades A-D) were randomly allocated to receive vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg once daily after breakfast. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with healed EE confirmed by endoscopy up to week 8. In addition, subjects who achieved healed EE in the comparison study were re-randomised into a long-term study to investigate the safety and efficacy of vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg as maintenance therapy for 52 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 409 eligible subjects randomised, 401 completed the comparison study, and 305 entered the long-term maintenance study. The proportion of patients with healed EE up to week 8 was 99.0% for vonoprazan (203/205) and 95.5% for lansoprazole (190/199), thus verifying the non-inferiority of vonoprazan (P < 0.0001). Vonoprazan was also effective in patients with more severe EE (LA Classification Grades C/D) and CYP2C19 extensive metabolisers. In the long-term maintenance study, there were few recurrences (<10%) of EE in patients treated with vonoprazan 10 or 20 mg. Overall, vonoprazan was well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The non-inferiority of vonoprazan to lansoprazole in EE was verified in the comparison study, and vonoprazan was well-tolerated and effective during the long-term maintenance study.
The care with which patients are monitored during clinical trials provides an excellent database to assess the tolerability and safety of drugs. Additional information can be obtained from knowledge of the compound itself, its metabolism and its pharmacological action. Other compounds from the same class can highlight areas that need particular study. All these factors have been used to assess the safety of lansoprazole. Lansoprazole has been administered to 4749 subjects and has been well tolerated. Only 1.2% of patients have been withdrawn from trials because of suspected drug-related events but there was no pattern and no relationship to drug dosage. Diarrhoea (3.2%) and headache (4.7%) were the most commonly reported adverse events.
