Moexipril was an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) used for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Moexipril can be administered alone or with other antihypertensives or diuretics. 
It works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. 
It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1995. Moexipril is available from Schwarz Pharma under the trade name Univasc.
