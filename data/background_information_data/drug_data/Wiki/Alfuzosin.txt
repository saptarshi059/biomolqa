Alfuzosin, sold under the brand name Uroxatral among others, is a medication of the α1 blocker class. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
As an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, it works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making urination easier. 
Alfuzosin was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1988. It was approved in the US for benign prostatic hyperplasia in 2003. In 2020, it was the 336th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700 thousand prescriptions.
