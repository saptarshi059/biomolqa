Duloxetine, sold under the brand name Cymbalta among others, is a medication used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and central sensitization. It is taken by mouth.
Duloxetine is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The precise mechanism for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects is not known.
Common side effects include dry mouth, nausea, feeling tired, dizziness, agitation, sexual problems, and increased sweating. Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, serotonin syndrome, mania, and liver problems. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped. There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the developing fetus.
Duloxetine was approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 2004. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 31st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions.
