Tirofiban, sold under the brand name Aggrastat, is an antiplatelet medication. It belongs to a class of antiplatelets named glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Tirofiban is a small molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction between fibrinogen and the platelet integrin receptor GP IIb/IIIa and is the first drug candidate whose origins can be traced to a pharmacophore-based virtual screening lead.
It is available as a generic medication.
