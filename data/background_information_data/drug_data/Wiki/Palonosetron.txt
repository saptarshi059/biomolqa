Palonosetron, sold under the brand name Aloxi, is a medication used for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is a 5-HT3 antagonist.
Palonosetron is administered intravenously, or as a single oral capsule. It has a longer duration of action than  other 5-HT3 antagonists. The oral formulation was approved on August 22, 2008, for prevention of acute CINV alone, as a large clinical trial did not show oral administration to be as effective as intravenous use against delayed CINV. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
The oral combination netupitant/palonosetron is approved for both acute and delayed CINV.
