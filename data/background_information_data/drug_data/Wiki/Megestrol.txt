Megestrol (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name) is a progestin of the 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone group which was, until recently, never marketed or used clinically. It is now used for treatments of disease-related weight loss, endometrial cancer, and breast cancer. Its acylated derivative megestrol acetate is also a progestogen, which, in contrast to megestrol itself, has been extensively used as a pharmaceutical drug.
