Iodixanol is also the active ingredient in a number of 'cushion' products used during the centrifugation of stallion semen. It is layered underneath the extended stallion semen allowing for a higher g force to be used with less sperm damage and better recovery rates. Post centrifugation the supernatant above and the cushion below is removed, leaving a concentrated sperm pellet in the conical tube.
