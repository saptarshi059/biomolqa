Cinacalcet, sold under the brand name Sensipar among others, is a medication used to treat primary hyperparathyroidism, tertiary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid carcinoma. Cinacalcet acts as a calcimimetic (i.e., it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues.
The most common side effects include nausea and vomiting.
Cinacalcet was approved in the United States in March 2004, and in the European Union in October 2004. It was the first allosteric G protein-coupled receptor modulator to enter the pharmaceutical market. In 2013, cinacalcet was the 76th most prescribed medicine in the United States.
