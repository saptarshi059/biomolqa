Desvenlafaxine, sold under the brand name Pristiq among others, is a medication used to treat depression. It is an antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class and is taken by mouth. It is recommended that the need for further treatment be occasionally reassessed. It may be less effective than its parent compound venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy.
Common side effects include dizziness, trouble sleeping, increased sweating, constipation, sleepiness, anxiety, and sexual problems. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, and high blood pressure. There is a high risk of withdrawal syndrome which may occur if the dose is decreased or the medication is completely stopped. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe.
Desvenlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2008. In Europe its application for use was denied in 2009. In 2022, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.
