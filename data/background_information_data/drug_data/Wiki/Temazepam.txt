Temazepam, sold under the brand name Restoril among others, is a medication of the benzodiazepine class which is generally used to treat severe or debilitating insomnia. It is taken by mouth. Temazepam is rapidly absorbed, and significant hypnotic and anxiolytic effects begin in less than 30 minutes and can last for up to eight hours. Prescriptions for hypnotics such as temazepam have seen a dramatic decrease since 2010, while anxiolytics such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam have increased or remained stable. Temazepam and similar hypnotics, such as triazolam (Halcion) are generally reserved for severe and debilitating insomnia. They have largely been replaced by z-drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem) and atypical antidepressants (trazodone, mirtazapine) as first line treatment for insomnia.
Common side effects include drowsiness, motor and cognitive impairment, lethargy, confusion, euphoria, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, hypotension, respiratory depression, abuse, anaphylaxis, and suicide. Use is generally not recommended together with alcohol or opioids. If the dose is rapidly decreased withdrawal may occur. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Temazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and hypnotic. It works by affecting GABA within the brain.
Temazepam was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1969. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions.
