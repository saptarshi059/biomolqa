Midodrine, sold under the brand names ProAmatine and Orvaten among others, is an antihypotensive medication used to treat orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing) and urinary incontinence. It is taken by mouth.
Side effects of midodrine include hypertension (high blood pressure), paresthesia, itching, goosebumps, chills, urinary urgency, urinary retention, and urinary frequency. Midodrine is a prodrug of its active metabolite desglymidodrine. This metabolite acts as a selective agonist of the Î±1-adrenergic receptor. This in turn results in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure.
Midodrine was discovered by 1971 and was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1996.
