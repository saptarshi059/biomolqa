Darunavir (DRV), sold under the brand name Prezista among others, is an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It is often used with low doses of ritonavir or cobicistat to increase darunavir levels. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is taken by mouth once to twice a day.
Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, rash and vomiting. Severe side effects include allergic reactions, liver problems, and skin rashes such as toxic epidermal necrolysis. While poorly studied in pregnancy it appears to be safe for the baby. It is of the protease inhibitor (PI) class and works by blocking HIV protease.
Darunavir was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2006. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.
It is available in the fixed-dose combination medication darunavir/cobicistat (Prezcobix, Rezolsta), and in the fixed-dose combination medication darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Symtuza).
