Perindopril is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, or stable coronary artery disease.
As a long-acting ACE inhibitor, perindopril works by inhibiting production of the vasoconstriction hormone, angiotensin, thereby relaxing blood vessels, increasing urine output, and decreasing blood volume, leading to a reduction of blood pressure. It also increases blood renin activity and decreases aldosterone secretion, causing increased urine production and excretion of sodium.
As a prodrug, perindopril is hydrolyzed in the liver to its active metabolite, perindoprilat. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1988. 
Perindopril is taken in the form of perindopril arginine/amlodipine or perindopril erbumine. Both forms are therapeutically equivalent and interchangeable, but the dose prescribed to achieve the same effect may differ between the two forms.
Perindopril should not be used during pregnancy, as it may harm the fetus. Some people may have allergic reactions to perindopril, while common side-effects may include cough, 
headache, dizziness, diarrhea, or upset stomach.
In Australia during 2023-24, it was the fourth-most prescribed drug.
