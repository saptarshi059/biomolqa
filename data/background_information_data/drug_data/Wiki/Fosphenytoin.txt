Fosphenytoin, also known as fosphenytoin sodium, and sold under the brand name Cerebyx among others, is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug that is administered intravenously to deliver phenytoin, potentially more safely than intravenous phenytoin. It is used in the acute treatment of convulsive status epilepticus.
Fosphenytoin was developed in 1996.
