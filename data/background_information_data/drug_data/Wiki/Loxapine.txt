Loxapine, sold under the brand names Loxitane and Adasuve (inhalation only) among others, is a tricyclic antipsychotic medication used primarily in the treatment of schizophrenia. The medicine is a member of the dibenzoxazepine class and structurally very similar to clozapine. Several researchers have argued that loxapine, initially classified as a typical antipsychotic, behaves as an atypical antipsychotic.
Loxapine may be metabolized by N-demethylation to amoxapine, a tricyclic antidepressant.
