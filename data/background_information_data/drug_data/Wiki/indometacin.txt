Indometacin, also known as indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins.
It was patented in 1961 and approved for medical use in 1963. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 256th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.
