Dexpramipexole is a first-in-class oral investigational medicine that lowers blood and tissue eosinophils before they can cause damage in the target organ. Dexpramipexole is being developed by Areteia Therapeutics and has the potential to be the first oral treatment ever approved for eosinophilic asthma. The eosinophil-targeting effects of oral dexpramipexole were discovered during its clinical development. Across five clinical trials, dexpramipexole has consistently been shown to significantly reduce blood eosinophil counts.
