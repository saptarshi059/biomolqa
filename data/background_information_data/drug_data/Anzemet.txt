BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse effect of anaesthesia and surgery. Up to 80% of patients may be affected. These outcomes are a major cause of patient dissatisfaction and may lead to prolonged hospital stay and higher costs of care along with more severe complications. Many antiemetic drugs are available for prophylaxis. They have various mechanisms of action and side effects, but there is still uncertainty about which drugs are most effective with the fewest side effects. OBJECTIVES: * To compare the efficacy and safety of different prophylactic pharmacologic interventions (antiemetic drugs) against no treatment, against placebo, or against each other (as monotherapy or combination prophylaxis) for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia * To generate a clinically useful ranking of antiemetic drugs (monotherapy and combination prophylaxis) based on efficacy and safety * To identify the best dose or dose range of antiemetic drugs in terms of efficacy and safety SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. The first search was performed in November 2017 and was updated in April 2020. In the update of the search, 39 eligible studies were found that were not included in the analysis (listed as awaiting classification). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effectiveness or side effects of single antiemetic drugs in any dose or combination against each other or against an inactive control in adults undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia. All antiemetic drugs belonged to one of the following substance classes: 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, D(2) receptor antagonists, NK(1) receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics. No language restrictions were applied. Abstract publications were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A review team of 11 authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias and subsequently extracted data. We performed pair-wise meta-analyses for drugs of direct interest (amisulpride, aprepitant, casopitant, dexamethasone, dimenhydrinate, dolasetron, droperidol, fosaprepitant, granisetron, haloperidol, meclizine, methylprednisolone, metoclopramide, ondansetron, palonosetron, perphenazine, promethazine, ramosetron, rolapitant, scopolamine, and tropisetron) compared to placebo (inactive control). We performed network meta-analyses (NMAs) to estimate the relative effects and ranking (with placebo as reference) of all available single drugs and combinations. Primary outcomes were vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively, serious adverse events (SAEs), and any adverse event (AE). Secondary outcomes were drug class-specific side effects (e.g. headache), mortality, early and late vomiting, nausea, and complete response. We performed subgroup network meta-analysis with dose of drugs as a moderator variable using dose ranges based on previous consensus recommendations. We assessed certainty of evidence of NMA treatment effects for all primary outcomes and drug class-specific side effects according to GRADE (CINeMA, Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis). We restricted GRADE assessment to single drugs of direct interest compared to placebo. MAIN RESULTS: We included 585 studies (97,516 randomized participants). Most of these studies were small (median sample size of 100); they were published between 1965 and 2017 and were primarily conducted in Asia (51%), Europe (25%), and North America (16%). Mean age of the overall population was 42 years. Most participants were women (83%), had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II (70%), received perioperative opioids (88%), and underwent gynaecologic (32%) or gastrointestinal surgery (19%) under general anaesthesia using volatile anaesthetics (88%). In this review, 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations were compared. Most studies investigated only single drugs (72%) and included an inactive control arm (66%). The three most investigated single drugs in this review were ondansetron (246 studies), dexamethasone (120 studies), and droperidol (97 studies). Almost all studies (89%) reported at least one efficacy outcome relevant for this review. However, only 56% reported at least one relevant safety outcome. Altogether, 157 studies (27%) were assessed as having overall low risk of bias, 101 studies (17%) overall high risk of bias, and 327 studies (56%) overall unclear risk of bias. Vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively Relative effects from NMA for vomiting within 24 hours (282 RCTs, 50,812 participants, 28 single drugs, and 36 drug combinations) suggest that 29 out of 36 drug combinations and 10 out of 28 single drugs showed a clinically important benefit (defined as the upper end of the 95% confidence interval (CI) below a risk ratio (RR) of 0.8) compared to placebo. Combinations of drugs were generally more effective than single drugs in preventing vomiting. However, single NK(1) receptor antagonists showed treatment effects similar to most of the drug combinations. High-certainty evidence suggests that the following single drugs reduce vomiting (ordered by decreasing efficacy): aprepitant (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38, high certainty, rank 3/28 of single drugs); ramosetron (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.59, high certainty, rank 5/28); granisetron (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.54, high certainty, rank 6/28); dexamethasone (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.57, high certainty, rank 8/28); and ondansetron (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.60, high certainty, rank 13/28). Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that the following single drugs probably reduce vomiting: fosaprepitant (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, moderate certainty, rank 1/28) and droperidol (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69, moderate certainty, rank 20/28). Recommended and high doses of granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol showed clinically important benefit, but low doses showed no clinically important benefit. Aprepitant was used mainly at high doses, ramosetron at recommended doses, and fosaprepitant at doses of 150 mg (with no dose recommendation available). Frequency of SAEs Twenty-eight RCTs were included in the NMA for SAEs (10,766 participants, 13 single drugs, and eight drug combinations). The certainty of evidence for SAEs when using one of the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs (aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol compared to placebo) ranged from very low to low. Droperidol (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.08 to 9.71, low certainty, rank 6/13) may reduce SAEs. We are uncertain about the effects of aprepitant (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 7.36, very low certainty, rank 11/13), ramosetron (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.74, very low certainty, rank 7/13), granisetron (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 13.15, very low certainty, rank 10/13), dexamethasone (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.85, very low certainty, rank 9/13), and ondansetron (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.32 to 8.10, very low certainty, rank 12/13). No studies reporting SAEs were available for fosaprepitant. Frequency of any AE Sixty-one RCTs were included in the NMA for any AE (19,423 participants, 15 single drugs, and 11 drug combinations). The certainty of evidence for any AE when using one of the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs (aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol compared to placebo) ranged from very low to moderate. Granisetron (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05, moderate certainty, rank 7/15) probably has no or little effect on any AE. Dexamethasone (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.08, low certainty, rank 2/15) and droperidol (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98, low certainty, rank 6/15) may reduce any AE. Ondansetron (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.01, low certainty, rank 9/15) may have little or no effect on any AE. We are uncertain about the effects of aprepitant (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97, very low certainty, rank 3/15) and ramosetron (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54, very low certainty, rank 11/15) on any AE. No studies reporting any AE were available for fosaprepitant. Class-specific side effects For class-specific side effects (headache, constipation, wound infection, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, arrhythmia, and QT prolongation) of relevant substances, the certainty of evidence for the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs mostly ranged from very low to low. Exceptions were that ondansetron probably increases headache (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28, moderate certainty, rank 18/23) and probably reduces sedation (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.96, moderate certainty, rank 5/24) compared to placebo. The latter effect is limited to recommended and high doses of ondansetron. Droperidol probably reduces headache (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, moderate certainty, rank 5/23) compared to placebo. We have high-certainty evidence that dexamethasone (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, high certainty, rank 16/24) has no effect on sedation compared to placebo. No studies assessed substance class-specific side effects for fosaprepitant. Direction and magnitude of network effect estimates together with level of evidence certainty are graphically summarized for all pre-defined GRADE-relevant outcomes and all drugs of direct interest compared to placebo in http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4066353. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found high-certainty evidence that five single drugs (aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, and ondansetron) reduce vomiting, and moderate-certainty evidence that two other single drugs (fosaprepitant and droperidol) probably reduce vomiting, compared to placebo. Four of the six substance classes (5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, D(2) receptor antagonists, NK(1) receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids) were thus represented by at least one drug with important benefit for prevention of vomiting. Combinations of drugs were generally more effective than the corresponding single drugs in preventing vomiting. NK(1) receptor antagonists were the most effective drug class and had comparable efficacy to most of the drug combinations. 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists were the best studied substance class. For most of the single drugs of direct interest, we found only very low to low certainty evidence for safety outcomes such as occurrence of SAEs, any AE, and substance class-specific side effects. Recommended and high doses of granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol were more effective than low doses for prevention of vomiting. Dose dependency of side effects was rarely found due to the limited number of studies, except for the less sedating effect of recommended and high doses of ondansetron. The results of the review are transferable mainly to patients at higher risk of nausea and vomiting (i.e. healthy women undergoing inhalational anaesthesia and receiving perioperative opioids). Overall study quality was limited, but certainty assessments of effect estimates consider this limitation. No further efficacy studies are needed as there is evidence of moderate to high certainty for seven single drugs with relevant benefit for prevention of vomiting. However, additional studies are needed to investigate potential side effects of these drugs and to examine higher-risk patient populations (e.g. individuals with diabetes and heart disease).
BACKGROUND: About 70% to 80% of adults with cancer experience chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). CINV remains one of the most distressing symptoms associated with cancer therapy and is associated with decreased adherence to chemotherapy. Combining 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists with corticosteroids or additionally with neurokinin-1 (NK(1)) receptor antagonists is effective in preventing CINV among adults receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). Various treatment options are available, but direct head-to-head comparisons do not allow comparison of all treatments versus another.  OBJECTIVES: * In adults with solid cancer or haematological malignancy receiving HEC - To compare the effects of antiemetic treatment combinations including NK(1) receptor antagonists, 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids on prevention of acute phase (Day 1), delayed phase (Days 2 to 5), and overall (Days 1 to 5) chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in network meta-analysis (NMA) - To generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to treatment safety and efficacy * In adults with solid cancer or haematological malignancy receiving MEC - To compare whether antiemetic treatment combinations including NK(1) receptor antagonists, 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids are superior for prevention of acute phase (Day 1), delayed phase (Days 2 to 5), and overall (Days 1 to 5) chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting to treatment combinations including 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists and corticosteroids solely, in network meta-analysis - To generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to treatment safety and efficacy SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings, and study registries from 1988 to February 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs including adults with any cancer receiving HEC or MEC (according to the latest definition) and comparing combination therapies of NK(1) and 5-HT(3) inhibitors and corticosteroids for prevention of CINV. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We expressed treatment effects as risk ratios (RRs). Prioritised outcomes were complete control of vomiting during delayed and overall phases, complete control of nausea during the overall phase, quality of life, serious adverse events (SAEs), and on-study mortality. We assessed GRADE and developed 12 'Summary of findings' tables. We report results of most crucial outcomes in the abstract, that is, complete control of vomiting during the overall phase and SAEs. For a comprehensive illustration of results, we randomly chose aprepitant plus granisetron as exemplary reference treatment for HEC, and granisetron as exemplary reference treatment for MEC. MAIN RESULTS: Highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) We included 73 studies reporting on 25,275 participants and comparing 14 treatment combinations with NK(1) and 5-HT(3) inhibitors. All treatment combinations included corticosteroids. Complete control of vomiting during the overall phase We estimated that 704 of 1000 participants achieve complete control of vomiting in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when treated with aprepitant + granisetron. Evidence from NMA (39 RCTs, 21,642 participants; 12 treatment combinations with NK(1) and 5-HT(3) inhibitors) suggests that the following drug combinations are more efficacious than aprepitant + granisetron for completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days): fosnetupitant + palonosetron (810 of 1000; RR 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.37; moderate certainty), aprepitant + palonosetron (753 of 1000; RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.98  to 1.18; low-certainty), aprepitant + ramosetron (753 of 1000; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21; low certainty), and fosaprepitant + palonosetron (746 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19; low certainty).  Netupitant + palonosetron (704 of 1000; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; high-certainty) and fosaprepitant + granisetron (697 of 1000; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06; high-certainty) have little to no impact on complete control of vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to aprepitant + granisetron, respectively.  Evidence further suggests that the following drug combinations are less efficacious than aprepitant + granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) (ordered by decreasing efficacy): aprepitant + ondansetron (676 of 1000; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05; low certainty), fosaprepitant + ondansetron (662 of 1000; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (634 of 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; low certainty), rolapitant + granisetron (627 of 1000; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; moderate certainty), and rolapitant + ondansetron (598 of 1000; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; low certainty). We could not include two treatment combinations (ezlopitant + granisetron, aprepitant + tropisetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Serious adverse events We estimated that 35 of 1000 participants experience any SAEs when treated with aprepitant + granisetron. Evidence from NMA (23 RCTs, 16,065 participants; 11 treatment combinations) suggests that fewer participants may experience SAEs when treated with the following drug combinations than with aprepitant + granisetron: fosaprepitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.07; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.39; low certainty), netupitant + palonosetron (9 of 1000; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.58; low certainty), fosaprepitant + granisetron (13 of 1000; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.50; low certainty), and rolapitant + granisetron (20 of 1000; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.70; low certainty). Evidence is very uncertain about the effects of aprepitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.14; very low certainty), aprepitant + ramosetron (11 of 1000; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.90; very low certainty), fosaprepitant + palonosetron (12 of 1000; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.95; very low certainty), fosnetupitant + palonosetron (13 of 1000; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.16; very low certainty), and aprepitant + palonosetron (17 of 1000; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.78; very low certainty) on the risk of SAEs when compared to aprepitant + granisetron, respectively.  We could not include three treatment combinations (ezlopitant + granisetron, aprepitant + tropisetron, rolapitant + ondansetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons.  Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) We included 38 studies reporting on 12,038 participants and comparing 15 treatment combinations with NK(1) and 5-HT(3) inhibitors, or 5-HT(3) inhibitors solely. All treatment combinations included corticosteroids. Complete control of vomiting during the overall phase We estimated that 555 of 1000 participants achieve complete control of vomiting in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when treated with granisetron. Evidence from NMA (22 RCTs, 7800 participants; 11 treatment combinations) suggests that the following drug combinations are more efficacious than granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days): aprepitant + palonosetron (716 of 1000; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.66; low certainty), netupitant + palonosetron (694 of 1000; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.70; low certainty), and rolapitant + granisetron (660 of 1000; RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33; high certainty).  Palonosetron (588 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; low certainty) and aprepitant + granisetron (577 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; low certainty) may or may not increase complete response in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to granisetron, respectively. Azasetron (560 of 1000; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34; low certainty) may result in little to no difference in complete response in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to granisetron. Evidence further suggests that the following drug combinations are less efficacious than granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) (ordered by decreasing efficacy): fosaprepitant + ondansetron (500 of 100; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; low certainty), aprepitant + ondansetron (477 of 1000; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (461 of 1000; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; low certainty), and ondansetron (433 of 1000; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; low certainty). We could not include five treatment combinations (fosaprepitant + granisetron, azasetron, dolasetron, ramosetron, tropisetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons.  Serious adverse events We estimated that 153 of 1000 participants experience any SAEs when treated with granisetron. Evidence from pair-wise comparison (1 RCT, 1344 participants) suggests that more participants may experience SAEs when treated with rolapitant + granisetron (176 of 1000; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.50; low certainty). NMA was not feasible for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons.  Certainty of evidence Our main reason for downgrading was serious or very serious imprecision (e.g. due to wide 95% CIs crossing or including unity, few events leading to wide 95% CIs, or small information size). Additional reasons for downgrading some comparisons or whole networks were serious study limitations due to high risk of bias or moderate inconsistency within networks. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This field of supportive cancer care is very well researched. However, new drugs or drug combinations are continuously emerging and need to be systematically researched and assessed. For people receiving HEC, synthesised evidence does not suggest one superior treatment for prevention and control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  For people receiving MEC, synthesised evidence does not suggest superiority for treatments including both NK(1) and 5-HT(3) inhibitors when compared to treatments including 5-HT(3) inhibitors only. Rather, the results of our NMA suggest that the choice of 5-HT(3) inhibitor may have an impact on treatment efficacy in preventing CINV.  When interpreting the results of this systematic review, it is important for the reader to understand that NMAs are no substitute for direct head-to-head comparisons, and that results of our NMA do not necessarily rule out differences that could be clinically relevant for some individuals.

Palonosetron is a potent and highly selective serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist that has been evaluated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. black triangle Intravenously administered palonosetron has a linear pharmacokinetic profile, with a long terminal elimination half-life ( approximate, equals 40 hours) and moderate (62%) plasma protein binding. In two randomised, double-blind trials in 1132 cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg was more effective than intravenous ondansetron 32 mg in producing a complete response (no emesis, no use of rescue medication) during acute (0-24 hours) or delayed (24-120 hours) phases, and similar to intravenous dolasetron 100 mg in acute, but more effective in delayed phase. Palonosetron 0.75 mg was similar to ondansetron (acute and delayed phase) or dolasetron (acute phase), but more effective than dolasetron in delayed phase. In patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (n = 667), the complete response rates during acute and delayed phases with intravenous palonosetron (0.25 or 0.75 mg) were similar to those seen in intravenous ondansetron 32 mg recipients in a randomised, double-blind trial. Intravenous palonosetron was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with few adverse events being treatment related. Palonosetron had no significant effect on the corrected QT interval or laboratory parameters.
The need to control chemotherapy-induced emesis has stimulated research into anti-emetics. Emesis is not only unpleasant, but negatively impacts on global quality of life. The development of two new classes of drugs has been responsible for the major advances in anti-emesis. The 5 hydroxytryptamine3 (5HT3) antagonists in combination with dexamethasone significantly improved the control of acute post chemotherapy emesis, but delayed emesis which can last for several days was still problematic, yet its incidence was underestimated by clinicians. Both the control of acute and delayed emesis was improved when the neurokinin1 (NK1) receptor antagonists were added to 5HT3 antagonists and steroids. The complete control of delayed emesis was improved by 21% with little toxicity. The triple drug combination has become the standard of care for preventing the emesis associated with cytotoxic drugs of high emetic potential.
BACKGROUND: Important progress in the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced acute and delayed emesis has been achieved but some fundamental needs still remain that requires new, efficacious antiemetic drugs. METHODS: A critical review of the results of published studies of aprepitant, a new NK1 receptor antagonist, and of palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a longer half-life. RESULTS: Aprepitant combined with dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist significantly increased the control of acute emesis with respect to dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist alone after cisplatin and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. For cisplatin nausea, aprepitant combined with dexamethasone significantly increased the control of delayed emesis with respect to dexamethasone alone, while for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy aprepitant is superior to a 5-HT3 antagonist in the control of delayed emesis. Palonosetron showed superior or similar efficacy to ondansetron and dolasetron in patients submitted to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and similar efficacy to ondansetron in patients submitted to cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are necessary comparing aprepitant alone or combined with dexamethasone with respect to the recommended antiemetic drugs for the prevention of delayed emesis induced by cisplatin and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as well as for palonosetron combined with dexamethasone with respect to other 5-HT3 antagonists combined with dexamethasone.
Chronic kidney disease is a common occurrence in patients with gynecological cancer. Systemic anticancer treatment in such patients is a challenge for clinicians because of altered drug pharmacokinetics. For those drugs that are excreted mainly by the kidneys, decreased renal function may lead to increased systemic exposure and increased toxicity. Dose adjustment based on pharmacokinetic changes is required in this situation to avoid life-threatening toxicity. In this review, we summarize the nephrotoxicity and pharmacokinetic data of agents commonly used in systemic anticancer treatment of gynecological cancers and dose adjustment guidelines in the presence of impaired renal function. We review 17 medications that need dose adjustment (cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, topotecan, irinotecan, etoposide, capecitabine, bleomycin, methotrexate, actinomycin D, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, metoclopramide, cimetidine, and diphenhydramine) as well as 27 drugs that do not (paclitaxel, docetaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, vincristine, letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen, leuprorelin, megestrol, gefitinib, erlotinib, trastuzumab, leucovorin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, aprepitant, dexamethasone, lorazepam, and diazepam). We also review the formulae commonly used to estimate creatinine clearance, including Cockcroft-Gault, Chatelut, Jelliffe, Wright, and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study formulae.
Existing guidelines for the prevention of antineoplastic chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children are constrained by the lack of robust evidence. Current guidelines recommend the use of a serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist plus a corticosteroid to prevent acute CINV. Consequently, antiemetic agents that are recommended for use in adult cancer patients do not appear in the current pediatric guidelines. In addition, there is no information to guide the selection of alternative antiemetic agents for children who either cannot receive the recommended agents or who do not respond adequately to the treatment. Possible barriers to adherence to the pediatric antiemetic selection guidelines that are currently available are discussed, and published pediatric experience with antiemetic agents recommended in the current adult antiemetic selection guidelines (dolasetron, tropisetron, palonosetron, aprepitant) is summarized in this review. The use of novel and emerging antiemetic therapeutic interventions metopimazine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl)-lorazepam (Avitan)-dexamethasone (Decadron) [BAD], nabilone, acupuncture, midazolam, olanzapine, mirtazapine, gabapentin, droperidol in children are explored.
Many patients with cancer receive multiple chemotherapy agents as well as other medications for coexisting medical conditions. Despite the introduction of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, the management of nausea and vomiting following cancer treatment and after cancer surgery remains complex, particularly when patients are receiving multiple prescription medications. As a drug class, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have good antiemetic efficacy and an improved safety profile over conventional antiemetics. Nevertheless, pharmacologic differences exist between these agents, such as their interaction with the metabolic cytochrome P450 system. This review examines the major metabolic differences between the most frequently prescribed 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron. The potential drug interactions that these differences may precipitate and key genetic interindividual variations in drug metabolism are also considered. To avoid or minimize potential drug interactions, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with the lowest risk of these interactions should be considered as first choice.
PURPOSE: To review and evaluate the potential cardiac effects of 5-HT(3) antiemetic treatment in patients who may be predisposed to cardiac complications resulting from malignancy, cytotoxic oncologic regimens, or preexisting comorbid conditions. DESIGN: A literature review was conducted on the negative cardiovascular effects of chemotherapeutic agents, and, more specifically, on the cardiac interactions of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: Clinical studies in healthy subjects have reported electrocardiograph changes following administration of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. However, there are limited data on the use of 5-HT(3) antiemetics when administered with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the development of significant electrocardiograph changes with some agents may indicate a potential for significant cardiac effects in patients, particularly those who may be predisposed to cardiac complication. CONCLUSIONS: As the predicted human life span increases, clinicians will be treating a larger, older oncology population. Because two of the most common major comorbidities are cardiovascular related, we need to be acutely aware of the toxic effects of chemotherapy, as well as the possible cardiac interaction of supportive agents, specifically the 5-HT(3) antiemetics. Until more data are made available, the best antiemetic option for patients receiving emetogenic and cardiotoxic chemotherapy may be the agent with the fewest apparent cardiac effects.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a frequent complication of surgery. Guidelines recommend using a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (eg, ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron) combined with a second agent (eg, dexamethasone) for patients at moderate to high risk for PONV. Although all 5-HT3 antagonists are effective, ondansetron and granisetron have been found to be effective at substantially lower doses than those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Metabolism of granisetron differs from metabolism of other 5-HT, antagonists, so it is less likely to adversely interact with other medications. This article explains the clinical pharmacology of 5-HT3 antagonists and provides recommendations for nursing management of PONV.
Shivering is a frequent complication in the postoperative period. The relative efficacy of pharmacological interventions to prevent this phenomenon is not well understood. We performed a systematic search for full reports of randomized comparisons of prophylactic, parenteral, single-dose antishivering interventions with inactive control (placebo or no treatment). Variable doses were converted to fixed doses. Dichotomous data on the absence of shivering were analyzed by using relative benefit (RB) and number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data from 27 trials (1348 adults received an antishivering intervention; 931 were controls) were analyzed. The average incidence of shivering in controls was extremely frequent (52%). Clonidine 65-300 microg (1078 patients), meperidine 12.5-35 mg (250 patients), tramadol 35-220 mg (250 patients), and nefopam 6.5-11 mg (204 patients) were tested in at least 3 trials each. All were more effective than control. For clonidine, meperidine, and nefopam, there was some weak evidence of dose responsiveness. For small-dose clonidine (65-110 microg), the RB compared with control was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.16-1.51); for medium-dose clonidine (140-150 microg), the RB was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.47-2.27); and for large-dose clonidine (220-300 microg), the RB was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.30-1.78). For all clonidine regimens combined, the RB was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.43-1.74), with an NNT of 3.7. For all meperidine regimens combined, the RB was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.37-2.03), with an NNT of 3. For all tramadol regimens combined, the RB was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.56-2.39), with an NNT of 2.2. For all nefopam regimens combined, the RB was 2.62 (95% CI, 2.02-3.40), with an NNT of 1.7. Methylphenidate, midazolam, dolasetron, ondansetron, physostigmine, urapidil, and flumazenil were tested in no more than 3 trials each, with a limited number of patients.
Intravenous 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are now established antiemetics in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis. For optimal convenience and acceptability, oral therapy is desirable. Retrospective comparisons indicate that oral granisetron may have an efficacy comparable with that of intravenous granisetron. Recent new data are available on the use of granisetron in the prophylaxis of acute emesis in randomized, double-masked trials. After moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, the optimal regimen appears to be 1 mg twice daily, although 2 mg once daily is equally effective. Oral granisetron is significantly superior to oral prochlorperazine. After high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy, oral granisetron is as effective as metoclopramide plus dexamethasone; the addition of dexamethasone further enhances its efficacy. Oral granisetron was well tolerated in all these trials. Headache and constipation were the most common adverse events, as has been reported for other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. No randomized trials of oral-only tropisetron or dolasetron have yet been published.
Anzemet (dolasetron mesylate) is being developed for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Twenty-four healthy male subjects were orally dosed with dolasetron mesylate, 200 mg, after either an overnight fast or a high-fat breakfast. The ratio of the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the reduced active metabolite (MDL 74,156) to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) values in fed compared to fasting subjects was 86.3% with a 90% confidence interval for the ratio within (80, 125)%, indicating bioequivalence. The ratio of the mean MDL 74,156 maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values was 70.6% in fed versus fasted subjects. The time to Cmax was statistically significantly longer after the high-fat breakfast (mean values, 1.11 h fasting and 1.80 h fed), probably due to delayed gastric emptying. It may be concluded that, although the rate of absorption was somewhat delayed, the extent of absorption did not change significantly when dolasetron mesylate was given with food.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects approximately one third of patients and may lead to aspiration, dehiscence, esophageal rupture, and increased treatment costs if inadequately controlled. An important therapeutic option for prevention of PONV is 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists. Nonetheless, therapeutic failure sometimes occurs. Metabolism by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system differs among the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and provides a rational explanation for decreased therapeutic efficacy in some patients. Four of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist agents (dolasetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, and tropisetron) are metabolized in various degrees via CYP2D6, an isoform subject to marked genetic polymorphism. In patients with duplicate CYP2D6 alleles, degradation into inactive metabolites occurs rapidly with these four 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, resulting in decreased efficacy for preventing PONV. Granisetron is the only agent in this class that is not metabolized via CYP2D6. Instead, granisetron is metabolized via the CYP3A4 isoform, which is not subject to significant genetic polymorphism. CYP2D6 genotype screening prior to PONV treatment may allow for modification of antiemetic dosing. An alternative is to use a 5-HT3 agent that is metabolized independently of the CYP2D6 isoform, such as granisetron, that would obviate the need for genotyping and may lead to improved prophylaxis of PONV.
We designed this study to assess the efficacy of dolasetron compared with clonidine and placebo in prophylaxis of postanesthetic shivering. We included 90 patients undergoing elective abdominal or urologic surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to one three groups (each group n = 30) using a double-blinded study protocol: Group A received 12.5 mg dolasetron, Group B 3 microg/kg clonidine, and Group C saline 0.9% as placebo. The medication was given after the induction of anesthesia. Postanesthetic shivering was judged by using a five-point scale. In the Clonidine group, 86.6% showed no shivering, whereas in the Dolasetron and Placebo groups, only 63.3% and 66.6%, respectively, were symptom free. Only clonidine, but not dolasetron, significantly reduced the incidence and the severity of shivering. We conclude that clonidine is effective in preventing shivering when given before surgery, whereas dolasetron, at the dose used, is not effective. IMPLICATIONS: Shivering, an irregular muscular fasciculation lasting longer than 15 s, is a common complication secondary to general anesthesia. We compared dolasetron with clonidine (an established antishivering drug) in the prevention of postanesthetic shivering. Dolasetron 12.5 mg was not effective.
A 52-year-old woman with hypertension and Graves' disease was scheduled for surgical removal of a meningioma. Intraoperative events were significant for hypotension requiring a vasopressin infusion. Prophylactic dolasetron was administered to the patient before emergence. The patient's trachea was easily extubated and she was neurologically intact at the end of the surgical procedure. On transport to the neurological intensive care unit, the patient developed torsades de pointes, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, before a return to normal sinus rhythm.
Our understanding of the pathophysiology of emesis has improved over the past 2 decades, and we now have drugs that can prevent acute emesis in most patients. Prevention and treatment of the delayed and anticipatory forms of chemotherapy-induced emesis remain a challenge.
Since there continues to be a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting associated with many types of surgery, and the standard antiemetics often do not achieve satisfactory results, there have been attempts to use the 5-HT3 antagonists. This group of substances is relatively new, but has already been used successfully as an antiemetic during chemotherapy. To date, results are on hand for four different 5-HT3 receptor blockers: ondansetron, tropisetron, granisetron and dolasetron. Applied intravenously, all four have been effective both in prophylaxis and also as therapy for postoperative emesis. Except for ondansetron, there is so far no definitely clear knowledge about the lowest possible effective dosage. The entire group is well tolerated: only occasional and minor side effects have been reported. Even though not all the hopes originally set in the 5-HT3 group of antagonists have been fulfilled, progress has nevertheless been achieved. Especially noteworthy points are a positive cost-effectiveness relationship of these drugs and their appropriate use in case of the proper indications.
Carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), an enzyme belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family, has been detected in all human tissues. CBR1 catalyzes the reduction of many xenobiotics, including important drugs (e.g. anthracyclines, nabumetone, bupropion, dolasetron) and harmful carbonyls and quinones. Moreover, it participates in the metabolism of a number of endogenous compounds and it may play a role in certain pathologies. Plant polyphenols are not only present in many human food sources, but are also a component of many popular dietary supplements and herbal medicines. Many studies reviewed herein have demonstrated the potency of certain flavonoids, stilbenes and curcuminoids in the inhibition of the activity of CBR1. Interactions of these polyphenols with transcriptional factors, which regulate CBR1 expression, have also been reported in several studies. As CBR1 plays an important role in drug metabolism as well as in the protection of the organism against potentially harmful carbonyls, the modulation of its expression/activity may have significant pharmacological and/or toxicological consequences. Some polyphenols (e.g. luteolin, apigenin and curcumin) have been shown to be very potent CBR1 inhibitors. The inhibition of CBR1 seems useful regarding the increased efficacy of anthracycline therapy, but it may cause the worse detoxification of reactive carbonyls. Nevertheless, all known information about the interactions of polyphenols with CBR1 have only been based on the results of in vitro studies. With respect to the high importance of CBR1 and the frequent consumption of polyphenols, in vivo studies would be very helpful for the evaluation of risks/benefits of polyphenol interactions with CBR1.
