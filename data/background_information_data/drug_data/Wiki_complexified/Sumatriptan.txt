Sumatriptan, a triptan-class pharmacologic agent, serves as a selective agonist for serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, exerting its antimigraine efficacy via vasoconstrictive and neuronal inhibition pathways. Administrable via oral, nasal, or subcutaneous routes, sumatriptan yields therapeutic outcomes in migraine and cluster headache relief typically within a three-hour post-administration window. While the precise mechanistic underpinnings remain somewhat ambiguous, its receptor specificity precipitates adverse effects like chest pressure, fatigue, emesis, paraesthesia, and dizziness, with potential for inducing severe pathologies such as serotonin syndrome, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and convulsive events. Chronic or excessive application can instigate medication overuse headaches, and its safety profile remains inconclusive during gestation and lactation. Despite these considerations, its clinical utility is underscored by its inclusion on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, availability in generic forms, and its prescription prevalence. Sumatriptan exhibits ready incorporation into combination therapies, such as with naproxen, to enhance therapeutic efficacy.
