Perindopril, a potent long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, effectively mitigates hypertensive states, heart failure, and stable coronary artery disease by obstructing angiotensin II synthesis, a critical vasopressor, thereby engendering vasodilation and augmented natriuresis, cumulatively attenuating systemic vascular resistance and volumetric load. The prodrug, perindopril, undergoes hepatic biotransformation to its active moiety, perindoprilat, exerting pharmacological efficacy through increased plasma renin activity and suppressed aldosterone biosynthesis, resulting in enhanced sodium excretion. Administered as perindopril arginine/amlodipine or perindopril erbumine, these formulations remain bioequivalent yet necessitate dosage adjustments for optimal equipotent dosing. Due to teratogenic potential, its usage is contraindicated during gestation, and hypersensitivity reactions alongside adverse events such as persistent cough, cephalalgia, vertigo, gastrointestinal disturbances represent common tolerability issues.
