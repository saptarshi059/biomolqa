Temazepam is a benzodiazepine class hypnotic agent indicated primarily for the management of severe insomnia, characterized by its rapid oral absorption with clinically significant hypnotic and anxiolytic actions initiating within 30 minutes and persisting for approximately eight hours. The pharmacodynamic efficacy is mediated via positive allosteric modulation of the GABA-A receptor, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission and inducing sedative-hypnotic outcomes. Despite its historical utilization, the prescription prevalence has diminished, supplanted by z-drugs and certain atypical antidepressants due to a more favorable side effect profile. Temazepamâ€™s pharmacokinetic and safety concerns include side effects such as ataxia, cognitive dysfunction, and in severe cases, can escalate to hallucinations, hypotension, and potential respiratory depression, particularly when co-administered with CNS depressants like alcohol or opioids. The withdrawal syndrome poses a significant risk upon rapid cessation following prolonged use. Teratogenic concerns contraindicate use during pregnancy and lactation. Despite its historical ubiquity as evidenced by over two million prescriptions in 2021, the clinical positioning of temazepam now leans towards refractory insomnia cases where alternative pharmacotherapy has been deemed inadequate.
