Temozolomide is a cytotoxic alkylating agent employed primarily in neuro-oncology for the management of high-grade gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma, administered orally or intravenously. The therapeutic action involves DNA methylation at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine, leading to DNA strand breaks and apoptosis, particularly effective in the presence of MGMT promoter methylation, enhancing chemosensitivity. Adverse hematologic effects largely manifest as myelosuppression, including neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia, alongside gastrointestinal disturbances such as emesis and anorexia, dermatological reactions typified by alopecia and rash, and neurological symptoms like convulsions and fatigue. Additionally, temozolomide's synergistic efficacy with PARP inhibitors, notably olaparib, extends its utility in salvage therapy for recalcitrant malignancies like relapsed small cell lung cancer, augmenting its strategic application in oncology pharmacotherapy.
