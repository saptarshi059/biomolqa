Benazepril, an ACE inhibitor marketed as Lotensin, is administered orally for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy by attenuating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. Formulations include benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide and benazepril/amlodipine combinations, targeting synergistic pathways for antihypertensive efficacy. The pharmacodynamic profile includes adverse reactions such as asthenia, orthostatic dizziness, and cough, while severe adverse events consist of potential nephrotoxicity, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. Teratogenic risks disallow its use during gestation, contrasting with permissible lactational use. Its pharmacokinetic properties have secured its status as a widely prescribed, generic therapeutic, illustrated by over three million prescriptions in the U.S. in 2022.
