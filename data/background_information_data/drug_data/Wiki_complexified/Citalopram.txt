Citalopram, a chiral bicyclic phthalane derivative and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is primarily employed in the pharmacotherapy of major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia through modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission. The therapeutic latency ranges from one to four weeks post-administration. It is predominantly administered orally, though parenteral administration via intravenous injection is utilized in specific regions to expedite therapeutic onset. The pharmacokinetic profile of citalopram encompasses hepatic metabolism predominantly via CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6, yielding demethylated metabolites. It is imperative to monitor for adverse reactions, including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, tremors, somnolence, hyperhidrosis, serotonin toxicity, and cardiotoxicity as manifested by QT interval prolongation. Contraindications entail concurrent MAO inhibitor therapy due to risk of serotonin syndrome and potential teratogenicity warrants cautious use in pregnancy. The potential for exacerbating suicidality in individuals under 25 necessitates vigilant monitoring. Citalopram's clinical prominence is evidenced by its inclusion in the WHO's List of Essential Medicines and its extensive prescribing frequency in the United States, underscoring its integral role in psychiatric treatment regimens.
