Fluorouracil (5-FU), commercially known as Adrucil, is a pyrimidine analog and antimetabolite cytotoxic agent, pivotal in the chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal, oesophageal, gastric, pancreatic, mammary, and cervical carcinomas. Administered via intravenous infusion, its mechanistic action primarily entails inhibition of thymidylate synthase, impairing DNA synthesis by disrupting de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, though the precise molecular pathways remain partially elucidated. Topically formulated, its indications extend to dermatological conditions such as actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma. Systemic administration commonly manifests toxicity profiles inclusive of mucositis, anorexia, myelosuppression, alopecia, and dermal inflammation; topical application predominantly results in localized irritation. Teratogenic potential contraindicates its utilization during gestation. Notwithstanding its adverse event spectrum, fluorouracil retains its status as an integral component of the WHO's Model List of Essential Medicines, underscoring its clinical utility in global oncology practices and dermatological applications.
