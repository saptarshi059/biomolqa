Dapsone, chemically delineated as 4,4'-sulfonyldianiline or diaminodiphenyl sulfone, operates as a bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent within the sulfone class, frequently co-administered with rifampicin and clofazimine in leprosy management. It serves as an adjunctive therapeutic in pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis and toxoplasmosis prevention within immunocompromised cohorts, as well as for dermatological conditions such as acne and dermatitis herpetiformis, available in both oral and topical formulations. Pharmacodynamically, dapsone's modes of action encompass inhibition of bacterial dihydropteroate synthetase, although it is associated with grave hematological adverse effects, notably hemolytic anemia exacerbated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and agranulocytosis, alongside potential hepatotoxicity manifested as hepatic inflammation. Methemoglobinemia and dermatological hypersensitivity reactions, encompassing a variety of rash presentations, constitute additional risk factors. The teratogenic profile remains equivocal; however, continuation during gestation is advised in leprosy cases. Economically accessible as a generic formulation, dapsone retains its inclusion on the WHO Essential Medicines List, underscoring its clinical utility and indispensable status in global health pharmacopeias.
