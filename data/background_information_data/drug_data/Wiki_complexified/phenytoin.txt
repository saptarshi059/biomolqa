Phenytoin (PHT), marketed as Dilantin, is a hydantoin derivative functioning as a voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor, efficacious in mitigating hyperexcitable neuronal circuits characteristic of tonic-clonic and focal seizures, yet ineffective against absence seizures. Its prodrug, fosphenytoin, is formulated for intravenous administration to manage benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus. Pharmacokinetics reveal rapid onset within 30 minutes post-intravenous administration, with a therapeutic window extending approximately 24 hours; plasma concentration monitoring is imperative for dosage calibration. Adverse effects range from benign, such as gastrointestinal disturbances, to serious, including cerebellar degeneration, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hematological suppression. Teratogenicity is documented, contraindicating its use in pregnancy, though lactation appears unaffected. Ethanol co-administration may perturb its antiepileptic efficacy. Despite the presence of a myriad of generic versions, phenytoin remains listed by WHO as essential due to its distinct pharmacodynamic profile and is widely prescribed, underscoring its significance in the therapeutic armamentarium for seizure disorders.
