Ondansetron, a potent antiemetic utilized to mitigate nausea and emesis associated with chemotherapy, radiation, migraine, and surgical procedures, exerts its pharmacological action as a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Absence of affinity for dopaminergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors precludes extrapyramidal side effects such as akathisia. Administered via oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes, ondansetron's pharmacokinetic profile is characterized by hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Adverse effects frequently reported encompass gastrointestinal dysmotility manifesting as diarrhea or constipation, central nervous system manifestations including headache and somnolence, and dermal pruritus, with more severe toxicities including QT interval prolongation on electrocardiographic assessment and anaphylaxis. Although the teratogenic risk is minimal, comprehensive teratological data in gravid populations remain insufficient. Recognized on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines, ondansetron is extensively prescribed, highlighting its clinical utility and incorporation into treatment protocols, with significant utilization confirmed by its high prescription frequency in the United States.
