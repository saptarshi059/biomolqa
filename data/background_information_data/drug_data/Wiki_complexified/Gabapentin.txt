Gabapentin, a prototypical member of the gabapentinoid class, is extensively utilized in the management of neuropathic pain syndromes, including diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, as well as partial epileptic seizures. Its mechanism of action predominantly involves high-affinity binding to the α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, encoded by the CACNA2D1 gene, thereby attenuating the synaptic release of glutamate and consequent hyperexcitability within central neuronal circuits. Although effective in approximately 30-40% of patients with neuropathic pain, the pharmacodynamic profile necessitates cautious administration, particularly in patients with renal impairment, due to its propensity to induce sedation, dizziness, potential for respiratory depression, and a heightened suicidality risk as classified by the FDA. Gabapentin's pharmacokinetic traits and adverse event profile require vigilant therapeutic monitoring to mitigate risks and optimize clinical outcomes. It continues to be a staple in therapeutic regimens, as evidenced by its status as one of the most prescribed medications in the United States, albeit historical controversies concerning its marketing strategies by the originating pharmaceutical entities.
