Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker with alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonism, is clinically utilized for managing hypertension and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), often despite beta-blockers not being preferred first-line antihypertensives due to inferior cardiovascular outcomes and safety profiles relative to alternative hypertensives. While its pharmacodynamic mechanisms contributing to therapeutic efficacy in HFrEF remain incompletely elucidated, vasodilation resultant from alpha-1 blockade may play a role. Adverse reactions encompass orthostatic hypotension, asthenia, arthralgia, nausea, and dyspnea, with bronchospasm as a potential severe manifestation. The drug's pharmacokinetics necessitate cautious use during gestation and lactation and contraindicate administration in hepatic impairment cases. Despite exhibiting a broad safety spectrum, carvedilol's utilization extends to over 17 million annual prescriptions in the U.S., affirming its presence on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines and availability in generic formulations.
