Ibuprofen, a widely utilized nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through the attenuation of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Indicated for alleviating nociceptive and inflammatory perturbations such as dysmenorrhea, migrainous episodes, and inflammatory arthropathies, ibuprofen demonstrates notable pharmacokinetics with onset of action within one hour post administration via oral or parenteral routes. Despite its efficacy, ibuprofen's pharmacodynamic profile correlates with several adverse outcomes, notably gastrointestinal mucosal irritation leading to potential bleeding, renal impairment with prolonged administration, and rare hepatotoxicity. It possesses a variable cardiovascular risk profile, posing increased myocardial infarction risk at higher dosages. Notably, ibuprofen is contraindicated in advanced gestational periods due to its deleterious fetal effects and can exacerbate asthmatic conditions. Although it constitutes a less potent anti-inflammatory than other NSAIDs, its inclusion in the WHO's List of Essential Medicines underscores its clinical utility across various domains. Despite its prevalence, ongoing vigilance is advised due to its side effect spectrum.
