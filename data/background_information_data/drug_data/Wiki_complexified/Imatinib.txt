Imatinib, branded as Gleevec and Glivec, is an orally administered ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor with specificity against a range of tyrosine kinases, including CSF1R, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, FLT3, and PDGFR-Î², making it a pivotal treatment in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), alongside applications in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Its mechanism involves the inhibition of the fusion protein Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, thereby impeding proliferative signaling cascades and inducing apoptosis in neoplastic cells. Notable adverse reactions encompass gastrointestinal disturbances, musculoskeletal discomfort, cephalalgia, dermatological manifestations, with more severe toxicities such as edema, myelosuppression, hemorrhagic events, hepatotoxicity, and cardiac dysfunction; moreover, teratogenic potential mandates cautious use during gestation. Imatinib's recognition by the World Health Organization as essential highlights its critical role in oncologic pharmacopeia, with a generic formulation introduced into the UK market in 2017.
