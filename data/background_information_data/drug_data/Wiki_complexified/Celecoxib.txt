Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, functions as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) utilized primarily for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, dysmenorrhea, acute pain management, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, celecoxib has prophylactic applications in reducing colorectal adenomatous formations in familial adenomatous polyposis due to its COX-2 inhibition, which mitigates pro-inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis while sparing COX-1, ostensibly minimizing gastrointestinal mucosal damage relative to non-selective NSAIDs. The pharmacokinetics permit oral administration, with pharmacodynamic effects commencing typically within one hour post-ingestion. Notable adverse reactions span gastrointestinal disturbances such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, with severe risk profiles including cardiovascular thrombotic events, gastrointestinal perforation, renal impairment, and hypersensitivity reactions like anaphylaxis, contraindicating its use in populations with significant cardiovascular risk profiles. The risk profile parallels that of other NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen, and caution is advised during late-stage gestation and lactation. Celecoxib's generic availability and widespread prescription underscore its clinical significance, albeit with requisite consideration of its potential side-effect burden.
