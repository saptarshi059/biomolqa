Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine-type long-acting calcium channel antagonist, exerts its pharmacological action primarily through vasodilation by impeding calcium ion influx through L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, which ameliorates hypertension, coronary artery disease, and variant angina. Administered orally, its pharmacokinetic profile necessitates caution in hepatic impairment and geriatric populations, requiring dose modulation. Although the teratogenic risk during gestation or lactation remains indeterminate, its side effect profile encompasses peripheral edema, lethargy, gastrointestinal distress, and potential hypotension or myocardial infarction. This compound's significant therapeutic utility has merited its inclusion on the WHO Essential Medicines List and extensive global prescription prevalence while remaining generically accessible.
