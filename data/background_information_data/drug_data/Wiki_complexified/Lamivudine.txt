Lamivudine, or 3TC, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with efficacy against HIV-1, HIV-2, and chronic hepatitis B virus. It functions by competitive inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase and hepatitis B virus polymerase, disrupting viral DNA synthesis. Clinically, lamivudine is integral to combination antiretroviral therapy, often co-administered with agents such as zidovudine, dolutegravir, and abacavir, and forms part of post-exposure prophylactic regimens. It is available for oral administration as liquid or tablet formulations, maintaining therapeutic flexibility through its dosing independence from food intake. While generally well-tolerated, adverse effects can include gastrointestinal disturbances, cephalalgia, asthenia, and respiratory symptoms; however, clinicians must vigilantly monitor for hepatotoxicity, lactic acidosis, and hepatitis B exacerbations. Suitable for patients over three months and deemed safe in pregnancy, lamivudine is recognized as an essential medicine, underscoring its pivotal role in antiretroviral pharmacotherapy despite potential genotypic resistance mutations.
