Hydralazine, a direct-acting vasodilator, primarily functions by eliciting arteriolar smooth muscle relaxation leading to decreased peripheral resistance and afterload, effectively lowering systemic blood pressure, particularly useful in hypertensive emergencies and heart failure. Its mechanism involves interference with intracellular calcium dynamics and modulation of nitric oxide signaling, highly favored in conjunction with isosorbide dinitrate for African American patients presenting with heart failure. Its pharmacokinetics reveal an onset of action approximately 15 minutes post-administration, with bioavailability subjected to first-pass metabolism, and a duration of effect extending up to six hours. Contraindications include coronary artery disease and mitral valvulopathy secondary to rheumatic heart disease, and caution is warranted in renal impairment necessitating dosage adjustments. Adverse effects, such as reflex tachycardia and cephalalgia, stem from compensatory sympathetic activation, thus contraindicating use in tachycardiac or CAD patients. Its inclusion on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines underscores its clinical significance, albeit it is low-cost and widely utilized, reflecting its extensive prescription volume.
