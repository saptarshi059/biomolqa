Ranitidine, an H2 histamine receptor antagonist, functions by inhibiting histamine stimulation of gastric parietal cells, thereby attenuating gastric acid secretion; this pharmacological blockade has historically positioned it as a therapeutic agent for acid-related disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Available in oral, intramuscular, and intravenous formulations, ranitidine's clinical utility was overshadowed by the detection of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potential carcinogen, within its preparations, leading to global concerns and market withdrawal. Subsequent epidemiological investigations, including a comprehensive Taiwanese cohort analysis, underscore a statistically significant dose-response correlation between ranitidine exposure and hepatocarcinogenesis, alongside elevated oncogenic risks across gastric, pancreatic, osseous, and pulmonary systems. While its adverse effect profile ranges from common occurrences such as cephalalgia to severe pathologies including carcinogenicity, hepatic dysfunction, bradycardia, and infection propensity, the risk of concealing neoplasms like gastric carcinoma has prompted heightened scrutiny. The agent's association with Clostridioides difficile colitis further complicates its safety landscape, ultimately resulting in its removal from essential medicine lists and cessation of its availability in principal healthcare markets.
