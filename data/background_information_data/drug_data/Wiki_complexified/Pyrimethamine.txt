Pyrimethamine, a folic acid antagonist deployed primarily in conjunction with leucovorin to mitigate its hematological toxicity, serves as a therapeutic agent against Toxoplasma gondii and Cystoisospora belli infections. Leveraged as a second-line prophylactic strategy when paired with dapsone, it targets Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV/AIDS cohorts, though its historical anti-malarial application has waned due to resistance. The pharmacological mechanism centers on the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, disrupting protozoal DNA synthesis and cell replication. Clinically, the oral administration of pyrimethamine necessitates vigilance due to adverse effects, notably gastrointestinal distress, hypersensitivity reactions, and potential for bone marrow suppression, contraindicating its application in folate-deficient anemia. Oncology concerns persist about its carcinogenic potential, and its teratogenicity risk mandates caution during gestation. Despite these concerns, pyrimethamine retains its status as a World Health Organization Essential Medicine and was ratified as a generic option in the U.S. pharmacopoeia as of early 2020.
