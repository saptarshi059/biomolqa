Chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline class antiparasitic agent, primarily exerts its antimalarial effects by disrupting Plasmodium spp. asexual intraerythrocytic stages through the accumulation of toxic haem within the parasite's acidic food vacuoles, thus hindering haemozoin biocrystallization and ultimately leading to plasmodicidal activity. Resistance phenomena necessitate adjunctive or alternative therapeutics, particularly among certain Plasmodium falciparum isolates. Beyond malaria, chloroquine demonstrates efficacy in extra-intestinal amoebiasis and provides therapeutic benefit in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, though the mechanistic pathways in these diseases remain elusive. Orally administered, chloroquine's adverse profile includes neuromuscular, dermatological, and gastrointestinal disturbances, with severe toxicities encompassing retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and hematologic dyscrasias. Despite exploratory investigations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the NIH advises against its use due to inefficacious outcomes in controlled trials. Chloroquine's inclusion in the World Health Organization's compendium of essential medicines underscores its indispensable role in therapeutics, and its established genetic availability ensures widespread access.
