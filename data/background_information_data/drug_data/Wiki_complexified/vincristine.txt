Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid derived from Catharanthus roseus, acts as a mitotic inhibitor by binding to tubulin, thus disrupting microtubule assembly and arresting metaphase progression in neoplastic cells. Clinically administered intravenously, it exhibits therapeutic efficacy against malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung carcinoma. Its pharmacological profile is marked by both neuropathic and systemic side effects, including peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, gastrointestinal stasis, and neuromuscular impairments, alongside potential for severe toxicities like myelosuppression and pulmonary compromise. Teratogenic risks contraindicate its use in gravid patients. Owing to its profound neurotoxicity, inadvertent intrathecal administration can precipitate fatal outcomes, underscoring the critical importance of adhering to strict administration protocols. Recognized for its oncologic utility, vincristine remains a cornerstone agent within chemotherapeutic regimens and is listed on the WHO's Essential Medicines index.
