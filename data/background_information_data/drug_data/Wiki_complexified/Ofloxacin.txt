Ofloxacin, a member of the fluoroquinolone class, functions as a DNA synthesis inhibitor by targeting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, making it efficacious against an array of bacterial pathogens. Clinically, ofloxacin is administered orally or intravenously for conditions such as pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and plague, with combination protocols extending its utility to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Furthermore, ophthalmic formulations address superficial ocular infections, while otic solutions are effective for otitis media complicated by tympanic membrane perforation. However, its pharmacotherapeutic profile is burdened by adverse effects like gastrointestinal disturbances, CNS involvement manifesting as headaches or psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy leading to limb paresthesia or tendon rupture, making it contraindicated during pregnancy. Despite these side effects, ofloxacin maintains a pivotal role in antimicrobial therapy, underscored by its inclusion in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines amid widespread prescription as a generic formulation.
