Diazepam, a prototypical member of the benzodiazepine pharmacological class, functions primarily as an anxiolytic by potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission, enhancing the binding affinity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA_A receptor complex. It is employed in the management of a diverse array of conditions, including, but not limited to, generalized anxiety disorder, status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal delirium, spasticity, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, with additional utility in procedural amnesia induction. Diazepam exhibits versatile administration routes—oral, rectal, intramuscular, intravenous, and intranasal, with IV administration eliciting rapid onset of action within 1-5 minutes and demonstrating a relatively short duration of clinical efficacy. Oral administration results in peak plasma concentrations within 15 to 60 minutes. While generally well-tolerated, its adverse effect profile includes CNS depression manifesting as sedation and impaired motor coordination, with rare, yet severe risks like respiratory depression, paradoxical excitation, and seizure exacerbation with chronic use. Chronic administration raises the risk of tolerance, physical dependence, and a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt cessation; cognitive impairments post-discontinuation are well-documented. It is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation due to teratogenic and neonatal withdrawal potential. Diazepam continues to be a mainstay therapeutic agent on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines, despite its risk for abuse and dependency, underscoring the necessity for judicious prescribing practice.
