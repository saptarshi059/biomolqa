Sildenafil functions primarily as a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for catabolizing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in smooth muscle cells. This pharmacological activity results in the potentiation of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, thus enhancing blood flow to the corpus cavernosum and mitigating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) through pulmonary vasodilation. The drug's pharmacokinetics include a rapid onset of action, typically within 20 minutes post-oral administration, and a duration of approximately two hours. Its bioavailability can be achieved via oral, intravenous, or sublingual administration. Concomitant use with nitrates or nitric oxide donors can precipitate severe hypotension, contraindicating concomitant administration. Side effects are often attributable to excessive peripheral vasodilation and can include headache, dyspepsia, facial flushing, and rare, albeit severe, adverse events such as vision or auditory impairment and priapism. Precision in its administration is imperative for individuals with cardiovascular pathology due to potential exacerbation of underlying conditions. Although efficacious in ED and PAH, its utility in female sexual dysfunction remains inconclusive.
