Lidocaine, or lignocaine, is a quintessential amino amide local anesthetic utilized extensively for its neuromodulatory and cardiac electrophysiological properties. As a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent, lidocaine exerts its mechanistic effect via blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby attenuating myocardial depolarization and stabilizing aberrant conduction pathways responsible for ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Its onset of action, contingent upon peripheral nerve administration, is typically rapid, achieving effective anesthesia within minutes, with a duration ranging from 30 minutes to three hours, and efficacy can be potentiated when co-administered with adrenaline due to vasoconstriction and augmented tissue retention. Topical formulations enhance transdermal absorption for sensory blockade across dermal and mucosal surfaces. In systemic circulation, particularly when administered intravenously, lidocaine may induce neurotoxic side effects including CNS agitation, visual disturbances, paresthesia, and emesis, in addition to cardiovascular effects such as hypotension and dysrhythmogenesis. Caution is advised with intra-articular administration due to chondrotoxicity concerns, and dose adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency, yet it remains a favorable option in patients with hypersensitivity to ester-type anesthetics like tetracaine. Due to its obstetric safety profile, lidocaine is deemed viable during gestation and its inclusion in the WHO's List of Essential Medicines underlines its critical therapeutic value and accessibility as a generic formulation.
