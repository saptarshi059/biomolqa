Rofecoxib, a COX-2-selective NSAID, was originally indicated for various arthritic conditions, acute pain, migraines, and dysmenorrhea, until its market withdrawal in 2004 due to augmented cardiovascular (CV) risks, particularly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, linked to prolonged high-dosage utilization. The drug's comparative pharmacodynamic profile achieved specificity towards cyclooxygenase-2 isoform inhibition, theoretically minimizing gastrointestinal mucosal compromise yet correlating with increased thromboembolic events, a risk shared by nonselective NSAIDs per longitudinal clinical evaluation. Despite its market retraction, an orphan drug designation was granted to Tremeau Pharmaceuticals in 2017 for rofecoxib (TRM-201) targeting hemophilic arthropathy (HA), a condition necessitating analgesic intervention devoid of NSAID-induced platelet inhibition or opioid dependency, thereby providing a unique therapeutic niche given the absence of other approved agents for HA in the U.S., a population at risk due to recurrent hemarthroses and its degenerative sequelae.
