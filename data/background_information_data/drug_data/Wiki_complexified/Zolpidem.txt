Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, distinguished pharmacologically as an imidazopyridine and classified as a Z-drug, primarily indicated for the short-term amelioration of insomnia. Its therapeutic efficacy in decreasing sleep latency, quantified as approximately a 15-minute reduction in sleep onset, is attributed to its function as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, thereby potentiating inhibitory GABAergic transmission in the central nervous system by binding at sites akin to benzodiazepines. Pharmacokinetically, zolpidem exhibits a biphasic elimination with a half-life averaging 2 to 3 hours, extended in hepatic impairment, necessitating careful dose adjustments. Administered orally, it is formulated as immediate-release, extended-release, and sublingual tablets, with dosing typically post-behavioral interventions such as CBT-I and sleep hygiene practices. Adverse effect profiles include, but are not limited to, somnolence, cephalalgia, nausea, and potential neuropsychiatric disturbances like amnesia and visual/auditory hallucinations, warranting consideration of flumazenil antagonism in overdose scenarios albeit primarily managed with supportive measures. Zolpidem's controlled substance designation under Schedule IV in the US reflects its abuse potential, underscored by its high prescription frequency with over 9 million prescriptions annually, placing it as a prominent therapeutic option for sleep disorders.
