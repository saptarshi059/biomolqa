Hydroxychloroquine, chemically classified within the 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial pharmacophore, is primarily indicated for malaria prophylaxis and therapeutic intervention in chloroquine-sensitive endemic regions, while possessing secondary applications in autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, and hereditary porphyrias like porphyria cutanea tarda. Orally administered as hydroxychloroquine sulfate, its pharmacodynamics entail immunomodulation potentially via interference with lysosomal activity and autophagy processes. Adverse effects range from gastrointestinal disturbances and neuromuscular impairments to severe toxicities, including irreversible retinopathy, potentially through phototoxic damage, cardiovascular arrhythmias, possibly via QT interval prolongation, and hypersensitivity reactions. Despite teratogenic risks, its teratogenicity remains unsubstantiated, enabling cautious use in rheumatic conditions during gestation. Although initial studies erroneously posited an antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, subsequent rigorously controlled clinical trials delineated a lack of efficacy coupled with a propensity for adverse events, jeopardizing drug availability for FDA-approved conditions. Consequently, hydroxychloroquine's role in COVID-19 treatment is widely contraindicated, reaffirming its therapeutic utilization within its defined medicinal scope.
