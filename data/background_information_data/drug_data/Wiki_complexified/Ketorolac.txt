Ketorolac, marketed under names such as Toradol, Acular, and Sprix, is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the management of moderate to severe nociceptive pain with a treatment limitation not exceeding six to seven days, varying by country guidelines. Administration routes include oral, nasal, intravenous, intramuscular, and ophthalmic, with onset of analgesia within one hour and duration of efficacy up to eight hours. Its mechanism of action involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), resulting in the attenuation of prostaglandin synthesis, and it possesses ancillary antipyretic properties. Common adverse reactions encompass sedation, vertigo, gastrointestinal discomfort, and emesis, while severe complications may involve gastrointestinal hemorrhage, nephrotoxicity, myocardial infarction, bronchospasm, heart failure, and hypersensitivity reactions. It is contraindicated in later stages of gestation and lactation due to potential fetal and neonatal risks. Despite its initial appeal as a non-opioid analgesic alternative with lower addictive potential, its correlation with significant adverse outcomes such as gastrointestinal and renal sequelae led to market withdrawal in specific regions like Germany. As a robust prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, ketorolac compromises renal autoregulation under conditions of hemodynamic stress or elevated catecholamine states, limiting its utilization in those with underlying renal or cardiovascular vulnerabilities.
