Pyridostigmine, a quaternary ammonium acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, augments synaptic acetylcholine concentrations by inhibiting its enzymatic hydrolysis, thus enhancing cholinergic transmission at neuromuscular junctions. Primarily indicated for the symptomatic management of myasthenia gravis and neurogenic bladder dysfunction, pyridostigmine also plays a pivotal role in reversing neuromuscular blockade induced by non-depolarizing agents, particularly when administered concomitantly with atropine to mitigate muscarinic side effects. Off-label, it addresses dysautonomia in certain variants of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Administered orally or via parenteral routes, it exhibits an onset of action at approximately 45 minutes with a pharmacodynamic tenure spanning up to four hours. Adverse effects manifest predominantly as gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and diarrhea, though hypotension, skeletal muscle weakness, and hypersensitivity reactions present significant risks. Its safety profile during gestation remains indeterminate. As an agent of the cholinergic pharmacotherapeutic class, pyridostigmine is enshrined in the World Health Organization's compendium of essential medications and is available in generic formulations.
