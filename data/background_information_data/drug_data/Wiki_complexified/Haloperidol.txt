Haloperidol, a butyrophenone derivative, exerts its therapeutic efficacy as a typical antipsychotic primarily through potent antagonism of central dopaminergic D2 receptors, ameliorating positive psychotic symptoms in conditions such as schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, acute mania in bipolar disorder, delirium, and alcohol withdrawal-related hallucinations. Exhibiting rapid onset post-oral or parenteral administration, haloperidol can be deployed via bi-weekly intramuscular depot injections for long-term management of schizophrenia spectrum disorders in non-compliant patients. While efficacious, haloperidol is implicated in extrapyramidal side effects, notably irreversible tardive dyskinesia and akathisia, along with the rare but severe neuroleptic malignant syndrome and dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, the latter significantly observed with intravenous routes. Its contraindication in patients with Parkinson's disease and increased mortality risk in dementia-related psychosis underscore the necessity for judicious application. Adverse fetal outcomes restrict its use during pregnancy. Despite these safety concerns, haloperidol maintains its status as an essential medication per the World Health Organization's compendium, continually ranking among the most prescribed antipsychotics in clinical practice.
