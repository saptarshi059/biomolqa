Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), exerts its pharmacological effects by non-selectively inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby attenuating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, which are pivotal in the pathophysiology of pain, menstrual dysmenorrhea, and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Administered orally in both immediate and delayed-release formulations, naproxen reaches therapeutic plasma concentrations within one hour, with a duration of action extending up to twelve hours, facilitating its utility in both acute and chronic settings. The sodium salt variant enhances oral solubility and absorption kinetics. While commonly associated with adverse effects including gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, and hypersensitivity reactions, more severe risks include cardiovascular thrombotic events and gastrointestinal bleeding, albeit with potentially a lower myocardial infarction risk relative to other NSAIDs. Its use is contraindicated in the presence of renal impairment and during the third trimester of pregnancy. Metabolic clearance occurs hepatically via biotransformation to inactive metabolites, with excretion primarily renal. Naproxen's widespread prescription, evident from over 7 million prescriptions in 2022 in the U.S., underscores its established therapeutic role, despite the potential for adverse event profiles.
