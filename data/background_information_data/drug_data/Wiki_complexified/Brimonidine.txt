Brimonidine is an Î±2-adrenergic agonist exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in attenuating open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension via modulation of intraocular pressure through dual mechanisms: decreased aqueous humor synthesis and enhanced uveoscleral outflow. Additionally, its vasoconstrictive action on cutaneous vasculature imparts symptomatic relief in erythema associated with rosacea when administered topically. The pharmacological profile is complemented by its inclusion in a fixed-dose compound with timolol maleate, enhancing antihypertensive efficacy. Ocular administration predisposes patients to localized side effects such as conjunctival hyperemia, pruritus, and xerostomia, whereas dermal application manifests as erythema, discomfort, and potential cephalgia. While systemic absorption is minimal, hypersensitivity reactions and hypotensive episodes warrant clinical vigilance. Brimonidine's safety profile in gravid populations is reassuring, and its generically available formulations have solidified its position as a mainstay in ophthalmic and dermatologic therapeutics, underscored by a substantial prescription volume.
