Fluphenazine is a high-affinity typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine cohort primarily prescribed for chronic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, offering efficacy comparable to chlorpromazine. Administered via oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous routes—or as a long-acting depot, fluphenazine decanoate—this compound exhibits prolonged dopaminergic antagonism with an extended half-life conducive to monthly dosing regimens. Notably contraindicated in severe depressive states, its pharmacological action is ascribed to dopamine receptor blockade, though precision in its mechanism remains indeterminate. The pharmacodynamic profile of fluphenazine entails extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, depressive mood alterations, and metabolic side effects, with grave adverse events encompassing neuroleptic malignant syndrome, agranulocytosis, and irreversible tardive dyskinesia. Moreover, in the geriatric cohort with dementia-related psychoses, mortality risk is potentiated. Prolactin secretion perturbations may elicit galactorrhea, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, and amenorrhea, with teratogenic safety in gestation unresolved. Chronic administration associates with hepatocellular enzyme elevation in a substantial patient subset. Despite its broad utilization reflected in its inclusion on the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines list, its production cessation in some regions underscores its dynamic availability landscape.
