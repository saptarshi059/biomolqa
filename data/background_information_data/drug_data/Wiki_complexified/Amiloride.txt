Amiloride, marketed as Midamor, is a potassium-sparing diuretic frequently employed adjunctively with thiazide or loop diuretics for managing hypertension and edematous states associated with heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, administered orally. Its pharmacodynamic profile is characterized by inhibition of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) within the late distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct, culminating in attenuated sodium reabsorption and concurrent preservation of potassium levels, manifested as reduced urinary potassium excretion. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicate a two-hour onset of action with a duration spanning approximately 24 hours. Adverse effects predominantly encompass hyperkalemia, pertinent to individuals with renal impairment, advanced age, or diabetes mellitus, along with gastrointestinal disturbances, dermatological reactions, and cephalalgia.
