Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is efficacious in the modulation of hypertension and heart failure via oral administration. It operates by antagonizing the angiotensin II AT1 receptor, thereby mitigating vasoconstrictive, aldosterone-secreting, and proliferative actions of angiotensin II. Clinically, it significantly reduces systemic vascular resistance and subsequently lowers blood pressure. While the therapeutic index is favorable, adverse effects such as upper respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal disturbances, and lumbar discomfort are noted, with more severe complications including renal impairment, hypotension, and angioedema. Telmisartan is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential teratogenicity and is not advised during lactation. It is frequently formulated in combination with diuretics or calcium channel blockers, like hydrochlorothiazide, cilnidipine, and amlodipine, to enhance antihypertensive efficacy.
