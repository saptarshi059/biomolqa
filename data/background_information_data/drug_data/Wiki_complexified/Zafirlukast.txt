Zafirlukast, an orally bioavailable leukotriene receptor antagonist, targets the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor subtypes CysLT1, thereby attenuating leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction, microvascular permeability, and airway inflammation pivotal in the asthma pathophysiology. While generally well tolerated, adverse reactions include cephalalgia and gastrointestinal disturbances; however, hepatotoxicity such as fulminant hepatic failure and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis have been sporadically reported, though the latter lacks a definitive causal linkage. Zafirlukast undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation via the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme, with consequential inhibition of CYP3A4, delineating a potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Polymorphisms in LTC4 synthase and cytochrome P450 2C9 may modulate individual response variability to this pharmacotherapy.
