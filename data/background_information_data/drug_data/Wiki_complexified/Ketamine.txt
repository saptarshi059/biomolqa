Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, serves as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, primarily utilized in clinical anesthesiology for induction and maintenance due to its unique ability to induce a state of dissociative anesthesia characterized by analgesia, sedation, and amnesia, while preserving autonomic reflexes, respiratory function, and cardiovascular stimulatory effects, such as increased cardiac output and moderate bronchodilation. Its pharmacokinetics allow lower, sub-anesthetic dosages to mitigate treatment-resistant depression and chronic pain, although the attenuation of therapeutic effects with time necessitates repeated administrations or adjunctive strategies. Despite its clinical utilities, ketamine's dissociative and hallucinogenic properties foster its illicit recreational use, often termed "Special K," with prurience towards both nascent and profound psychotropic experiences, compounded by long-term hepatic and lower urinary tract toxicity risks in habitual users. The drugâ€™s presence spans both human and veterinary medicine, underscored by its inclusion on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines, reflecting its essential pharmacological versatility and accessibility as a generic formulation.
