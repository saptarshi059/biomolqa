Paracetamol, or acetaminophen, functions as a para-aminophenol derivative providing analgesic and antipyretic effects predominantly by inhibiting COX enzymes within the central nervous system; however, its peripheral anti-inflammatory impact is minimal compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. It is therapeutically advantageous for alleviating mild to moderate pain in conditions such as acute mild migraine and episodic tension headaches, though the analgesic efficacy is modest in osteoarthritic and low back pain contexts, with negligible evidence supporting its utility in cancer and neuropathic pain management. Paracetamol at standard dosing mitigates fever to a limited extent; however, it is suboptimal compared to ibuprofen, particularly in febrile states of viral etiology, rendering its role in antipyresis debatable. Despite its generally safe profile when administered short-term and adherence to a maximum recommended dosage of three to four grams daily, paracetamol harbors hepatotoxic potential when overdosed, being a preeminent cause of drug-induced acute hepatic failure in Western populations. Its metabolic pathway in the liver, involving cytochrome P450 enzymes and subsequent depletion of glutathione reserves, underscores the mechanism of hepatotoxicity. Chronic use may elicit gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic dysfunction, whereas its utilization might be beneficial for patients contraindicated for NSAID therapy. Clinically, combination therapies, such as with ibuprofen, exhibit increased analgesic efficacy, while the triple combination of aspirin, paracetamol, and caffeine remains a preferred first-line intervention for mild pain syndromes. Paracetamolâ€™s clinical application persists widely, inscribed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, and forecasts substantial prescription numbers globally.
