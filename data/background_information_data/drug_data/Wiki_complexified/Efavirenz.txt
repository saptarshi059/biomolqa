Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), exerts its antiretroviral efficacy by allosterically inhibiting the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme, thereby impeding viral DNA synthesis and subsequent viral replication. Typically administered orally, either as a monotherapy or in combination formulations such as efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir, it constitutes a cornerstone in antiretroviral regimens aimed at both therapeutic management and post-exposure prophylaxis in cases of potential HIV transmission exposure, such as needlestick injuries. Despite its clinical efficacy, adverse events such as dermatological eruptions, including Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome, and neuropsychiatric manifestations, encompassing depression and suicidal ideations, as well as hepatic and neurological disturbances, notably contraindicate its use during pregnancy due to potential teratogenicity. However, due to its clinical importance, evidenced by its inclusion in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, it remains widely available, including in generic formulations post-patent expiration.
