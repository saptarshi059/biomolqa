Metoprolol, a cardioselective Î²1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, is clinically utilized in the management of angina pectoris, hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, post-myocardial infarction secondary prophylaxis, and migraine prophylaxis. Its therapeutic efficacy is mediated via negative chronotropic and inotropic effects which result in decreased myocardial oxygen demand and improved exercise tolerance. The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol is influenced by hepatic cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme variability leading to significant interpatient variability in drug metabolism, necessitating individualized dosing. Adverse effects prominently include insomnia, asthenia, presyncope, and gastrointestinal disturbances, with higher doses presenting risk for pronounced toxicity. Though teratogenic risk during pregnancy has not been conclusively excluded, its excretion into breast milk is considered clinically insignificant. Metoprolol is widely dispensed, reflecting its inclusion in the WHO's Essential Medicines, and its prescription frequency underscores its pivotal role in cardiovascular therapeutics.
