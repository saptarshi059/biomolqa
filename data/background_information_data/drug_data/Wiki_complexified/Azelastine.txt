Azelastine functions as a second-generation H1 receptor antagonist with multifaceted applications, notably as a nasal spray for allergic rhinitis and ocular drops for allergic conjunctivitis, while also exhibiting utility in the management of asthma and dermal hypersensitivity reactions via oral administration. Its pharmacodynamics involve rapid onset, with ocular effects manifesting within minutes and intranasal effects appearing within an hour, sustained for up to 12 hours. This antihistaminic agent exerts its therapeutic efficacy by impeding the release of inflammatory mediators, prominently histamine, thus mitigating allergic symptomatology. The adverse effect profile includes cephalalgia, somnolence, dysgeusia, and pharyngitis, with its safety profile during gestation and lactation remaining ambiguous. Azelastine's widespread usage is reflected in its substantial prescription frequency, denoting its significance in the therapeutic landscape.
