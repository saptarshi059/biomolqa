Formoterol, a potent long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA), functions as a bronchodilator specifically targeting pulmonary smooth muscle to induce bronchodilation, thereby offering therapeutic utility in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notably, formoterol distinguishes itself by a prolonged bronchodilatory efficacy of approximately 12 hours post-administration, surpassing the 4-6 hour window typical of short-acting β2 agonists like salbutamol (albuterol). Its pharmacokinetic profile is characterized by a rapid onset of action within 2-3 minutes, setting it apart from other LABAs. According to the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines, adult treatment regimens favor a formoterol and inhaled corticosteroid combination for both prophylactic and acute symptom management, whereas pediatric protocols prioritize short-acting β2 adrenergic agonists, such as salbutamol for immediate relief. Formoterol is commercially available both as a standalone generic medication and in synergistic fixed-dose combinations, notably with budesonide and mometasone, to enhance its clinical efficacy in targeted therapeutic strategies.
