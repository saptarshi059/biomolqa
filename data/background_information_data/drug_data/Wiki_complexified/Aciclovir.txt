Aciclovir, an antiviral guanosine analogue, exhibits its therapeutic efficacy predominantly by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase through its metabolization to aciclovir triphosphate, resulting in the cessation of herpesvirus DNA elongation across Herpes Simplex Virus, varicella-zoster, and CMV prophylaxis post-transplantation. Administerable orally, topically, or intravenously, its pharmacokinetic profile necessitates careful consideration in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function due to potential nephrotoxicity and thrombocytopenia. While demonstrating an acceptable safety margin during gestation and lactation, adverse events such as gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea are common. Its inclusion in the WHO's Essential Medicines list underscores its global pivotal role in antiviral therapy, with its generic accessibility enhancing universal healthcare implementation.
