Duloxetine, a pharmacological agent classified as a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), exhibits efficacy in ameliorating symptoms associated with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and central sensitization by modulating the synaptic reuptake mechanisms of neurotransmitters. While the exact molecular pathways underlying its therapeutic anxiolytic and antidepressant effects remain elusive, duloxetine's engagement with serotonergic and noradrenergic systems is hypothesized to play a critical role. Adverse events frequently encountered include xerostomia, nausea, asthenia, vertigo, psychomotor agitation, sexual dysfunction, and hyperhidrosis, while the drug also poses risks of severe outcomes such as heightened suicidality, serotonin toxicity, manic episodes, hepatotoxicity, and teratogenic effects if administered during late gestation. Additionally, abrupt cessation of duloxetine may precipitate antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Marketed as both branded and generic formulations, duloxetine figures prominently in psychopharmacology, ranking among the most prescribed medications with significant prevalence, underscoring its entrenched role in contemporary clinical practice.
