Thalidomide is an orally administered immunomodulatory drug widely utilized in the treatment of hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma, graft-versus-host disease, and dermatological complications stemming from leprosy, while concurrently exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in addressing various HIV-associated pathological manifestations, including aphthous ulcers, wasting syndrome, diarrhea, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Its pharmacodynamic profile, however, is complicated by adverse side effects ranging from somnolence and dermatological reactions to severe toxicities like tumor lysis syndrome, thromboembolic events, and neurotoxic peripheral neuropathy. Esteemed for its teratogenic potential, thalidomide is notorious for inducing profound embryopathy characterized by dysmelia, phocomelia, and cardial, ocular, renal, and skeletal anomalies, with a teratogenic threshold reached at minimal exposure levels, necessitating stringent regulatory safeguards to mitigate its exposure during gestation. Despite its tumultuous pharmacovigilance history, culminating in significant international moratoria due to catastrophic fetal outcomes, thalidomide has been rehabilitated into clinical practice under rigorous control, receiving FDA approval in 1998 for oncological and autoimmune indications and gaining inclusion in the WHO List of Essential Medicines, reflecting its critical therapeutic value in modern medicine.
