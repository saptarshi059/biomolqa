Darunavir (DRV) is an antiretroviral protease inhibitor utilized primarily for the therapeutic regimen of HIV/AIDS, necessitating concomitant administration with pharmacokinetic enhancers such as ritonavir or cobicistat to potentiate systemic bioavailability. DRV performs its mechanism of action through the inhibition of the HIV-1 protease enzyme, thus impairing viral polyprotein processing and subsequent viral maturation. Clinical administration can be post-exposure prophylaxis, particularly following potential occupational or non-occupational exposure. Adverse effects manifest variably from gastrointestinal disturbances to severe dermatological reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, with hepatotoxicity noted as a critical consideration. While teratogenic data remains limited, current clinical evidence suggests relative neonatal safety. Commercial formulations include combination therapies like darunavir/cobicistat (Prezcobix, Rezolsta) and darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Symtuza), presenting enhanced compliance through reduced dosing complexity.
