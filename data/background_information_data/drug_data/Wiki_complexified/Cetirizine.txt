Cetirizine, a second-generation selective H1 antihistaminergic agent, is primarily administered orally for the amelioration of allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and urticaria, exerting its pharmacodynamic effects predominantly extracellularly, thereby minimizing central nervous system penetration and consequent sedative effects typical of first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Its clinical onset transpires within thirty minutes, maintaining therapeutic efficacy for approximately 24 hours with an adverse effect profile that includes somnolence, xerostomia, cephalalgia, and abdominal discomfort, albeit with a diminished proclivity for sedation compared to its first-generation counterparts due to its peripheral selectivity. Amongst its second-generation analogs, cetirizine exhibits a comparatively higher incidence of somnolence vis-à-vis fexofenadine and loratadine. It is contraindicated in lactation but permissible during gestation and extends its utility to pediatric cohorts with caution advised regarding potential somnolence. Being generically available and included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, cetirizine’s broad prescriptive prevalence, as evidenced by over 13 million US prescriptions in 2022, underscores its efficacy and widespread utilitarian value in allergy management.
