Acetazolamide, marketed under the trade name Diamox, serves as a versatile pharmaceutical agent within the realm of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, effectively modulating intraocular pressure via the diminution of aqueous humor production and osmolality. Its clinical utility spans across conditions such as glaucoma—both open-angle and acute angle closure—epilepsy, acute mountain sickness, periodic paralysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and heart failure, with an ancillary role in urinary alkalinization. Therapeutic administration is achievable through oral and intravenous modalities. Mechanistically, acetazolamide exerts its effects by disrupting the equilibria of carbon dioxide hydration and subsequent bicarbonate ion production, thereby reducing intracellular hydrogen ion availability. The pharmacodynamic profile encompasses neuro-sensory side effects like paresthesia and tinnitus, alongside anorexia, emesis, and somnolence. Contraindications are notable in individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide derivatives. As a diuretic and enzymatic inhibitor, it holds a position on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines, emphasizing its critical global accessibility as a generic formulation.
