Ziprasidone, primarily marketed as Geodon, is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in managing both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with formulary options for oral and intramuscular (IM) administration. The IM variant, ziprasidone mesylate trihydrate, is particularly leveraged for rapid amelioration of acute agitative states in schizophrenic patients, whereas oral administration utilizes the hydrochloride salt form. The pharmacodynamic profile of ziprasidone suggests a mechanism of action predicated on modulation of serotonergic (5-HT) and dopaminergic (D2) neurotransmitter pathways, although the precise mechanistic underpinnings remain elusive. The adverse effect spectrum spans neuromotor disturbances like tremors and tics, autonomic nervous system effects such as dry mouth and nausea, and characteristic psychotropic-induced sedation. Notably, ziprasidone presents a reduced risk of weight gain compared to its atypical counterparts. Despite its complex pharmacological profile, ziprasidone occupies a significant niche in psychopharmacotherapy, underscored by its prescription prevalence, ranking 282nd in the U.S. pharmaceutical landscape as of 2020 with over a million prescriptions circulated.
