Chlortalidone, a thiazide-like sulfonamide diuretic, is predominantly prescribed for antihypertensive therapy and states of edema associated with heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome, as well as for managing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis. Its pharmacodynamic efficacy stems from modulating renal sodium and water excretion, thereby affecting volume and pressure homeostasis; the precise mechanistic pathways, however, remain partially elucidated. Its pharmacokinetic profile reveals oral bioavailability with an onset of diuresis within approximately three hours, sustaining therapeutic effects for up to 72 hours. Comparative studies suggest chlortalidone's superior cardiovascular outcome efficacy over hydrochlorothiazide in long-term stroke and myocardial infarction prophylaxis, despite a contentious spectrum of adverse effect profiles, including hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, orthostatic hypotension, and reduced erectile function, alongside rarer occurrences of gout, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, and hypersensitivity reactions. Pregnancy use, although possible, is approached with caution due to alternative preferred therapeutics. As part of the WHO's essential medicines list, chlortalidone remains a critical agent in hypertension management, widely available as a cost-effective generic, reflecting its substantial utilization in clinical practice.
