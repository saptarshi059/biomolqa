Mercaptopurine, a thiopurine analogue and antimetabolite, exerts its pharmacological action by interfering with purine nucleotide synthesis, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of rapidly dividing cells such as malignant and immune cells. Its primary clinical applications include the management of hematological malignancies like acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), as well as the modulation of aberrant immune responses in conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Mercaptopurine is administered orally and often in conjunction with methotrexate for synergistic effects in ALL. Its pharmacokinetics is significantly influenced by polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), with TPMT deficiency resulting in elevated risk of myelosuppression and other toxicities. Hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal disturbances, and anorexia are amongst its prevalent adverse effects, while more severe sequelae include heightened oncogenic potential and pancreatitis. Its teratogenic potential contraindicates use in pregnancy. As a cornerstone of chemotherapeutic regimens, mercaptopurine is recognized on WHO's List of Essential Medicines.
