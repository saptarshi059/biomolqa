Lamotrigine, a phenyltriazine anticonvulsant, is primarily utilized in the pharmacological management of epilepsy, encompassing focal, tonic-clonic, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizures, as well as serving as a mood-stabilizing agent in bipolar disorder. While it does not consistently ameliorate acute depressive states in bipolar disorders outside of severe depression contexts, it efficaciously mitigates the risk of recurrent depressive episodes in euthymic individuals. Additionally, lamotrigine is prescribed off-label for major depressive disorder and depersonalization-derealization disorder. Its pharmacodynamics are hypothesized to involve the inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter release through modulation of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels. Despite its therapeutic efficacy, lamotrigine's adverse effect profile includes both common side effects such as nausea, somnolence, headache, emesis, ataxia, and dermatological reactions, and serious reactions like hemolytic anemia, suicidality, and potentially fatal Stevensâ€“Johnson syndrome.
