Amphetamine (alpha-methylphenethylamine), a prototypical phenethylamine and substituted amphetamine, acts as a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, primarily augmenting norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmission. It exists as racemic mixtures of its enantiomers, dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, used therapeutically in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and as lisdexamfetamine for binge eating disorder. Its sympathomimetic effects at prescribed doses manifest as euphoria, heightened alertness, cognitive enhancement, and anorectic effects, whereas supratherapeutic dosing can precipitate neurotoxicological outcomes such as dopamine dysregulation, leading to hallucinations, delusions, and sympathomimetic toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. The pharmacodynamics involve promoting synaptic release and inhibiting reuptake of monoamines. Structurally related to endogenous trace amines like phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine, amphetamine has a notable abuse potential with illicit use often exceeding therapeutic dosages, thereby enhancing risk of addiction and psychosis. Historically, its derivatives have included drugs like bupropion, cathinone, MDMA, and methamphetamine, sharing mechanistic overlap in monoaminergic modulation. Therapeutically, amphetamine is available as racemic mixtures or as stereospecific formulations such as Adderall and dextroamphetamine, with its clinical applications intricately regulated given its high potential for misuse.
