Pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist in the miotics pharmacological class, exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through cholinergic receptor activation, specifically targeting muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to facilitate aqueous humor outflow via the trabecular meshwork. While its ophthalmic formulation is indicated for acute intervention in angle-closure glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and primary open-angle glaucoma, its utility is limited in chronic management due to adverse effects such as ocular irritation, lacrimation increase, cephalalgia, and transient visual disturbances, with potential complications including retinal detachment and hypersensitivity reactions. Pilocarpine's pharmacodynamics involve onset within one hour with effects persisting up to 24 hours. Systemic administration is employed in xerostomia management secondary to Sj√∂gren syndrome or post-radiation sequelae. Nonetheless, its use contraindicated during pregnancy underscores its safety profile concerns. Initially derived from Pilocarpus spp., pilocarpine remains inextricably linked to its historical provenance yet maintains its clinical relevance as delineated in the WHO Essential Medicines list.
