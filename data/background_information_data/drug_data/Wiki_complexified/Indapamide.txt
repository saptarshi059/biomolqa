Indapamide, a thiazide-like sulfonamide diuretic, is employed primarily in mitigating hypertension and addressing decompensated heart failure, functioning by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, which consequently enhances renal excretion of sodium and water, thereby reducing plasma volume and vascular resistance. Its efficacy parallels that of traditional thiazide diuretics and, in combination with perindopril, exerts an enhanced antihypertensive synergy. Indapamide demonstrates a favorable cardiovascular profile, attenuating risks associated with major events and heart failure in hypertensive cohorts, akin to chlorthalidone, and shows superior outcomes compared to hydrochlorothiazide. Moreover, both thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics effectively minimize stroke incidence, maintaining safety profiles comparable to other antihypertensive classes such as angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, while exhibiting a diminished spectrum of adverse effects relative to ACE inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium blockers, thus occupying a critical niche in essential therapeutic regimens.
