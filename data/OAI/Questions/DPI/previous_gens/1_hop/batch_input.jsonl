Its pharmacodynamics involve rapid onset, with ocular effects manifesting within minutes and intranasal effects appearing within an hour, sustained for up to 12 hours. This antihistaminic agent exerts its therapeutic efficacy by impeding the release of inflammatory mediators, prominently histamine, thus mitigating allergic symptomatology. The adverse effect profile includes cephalalgia, somnolence, dysgeusia, and pharyngitis, with its safety profile during gestation and lactation remaining ambiguous. Azelastine's widespread usage is reflected in its substantial prescription frequency, denoting its significance in the therapeutic landscape.\n\nPROTEIN NAME: HRH1\nPROTEIN BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The H1 receptor is a histamine receptor belonging to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is activated by the biogenic amine histamine. It is expressed in smooth muscles, on vascular endothelial cells, in the heart, and in the central nervous system. The H1 receptor is linked to an intracellular G-protein (Gq) that activates phospholipase C and the inositol triphosphate (IP3) signalling pathway. Antihistamines, which act on this receptor, are used as anti-allergy drugs. The crystal structure of the receptor has been determined (shown on the right/below) and used to discover new histamine H1 receptor ligands in structure-based virtual screening studies.\n\nDRUG-PROTEIN INTERACTION TRIPLE (subject-predicate-object): Azelastine-binding and inhibition-HRH1"}]}}

A receptor so bound would not be susceptible to CTX or PTX.

In humans it is highly expressed in the pancreas and is also expressed in the stomach, adrenal cortex and brain.\nGastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) regulates numerous functions of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, including release of gastrointestinal hormones, smooth muscle cell contraction, and epithelial cell proliferation and is a potent mitogen for neoplastic tissues. The effects of GRP are mediated through the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. This receptor is a glycosylated, 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor that activates the phospholipase C signaling pathway. The receptor is aberrantly expressed in numerous cancers such as those of the lung, colon, and prostate. An individual with autism and multiple exostoses was found to have a balanced translocation between chromosome 8 and a chromosome X breakpoint located within the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor gene.\nThe transcription factor CREB is a regulator of human GRP-R expression in colon cancer.\nActivation MOR1D\u2010GRPR heteromers in the spinal cord mediate the common troublesome opioid-induced itch.\n\nDRUG-PROTEIN INTERACTION TRIPLE (subject-predicate-object): Metoprolol-binding and activation-GRPR"}]}}

Leveraged as a second-line prophylactic strategy when paired with dapsone, it targets Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV/AIDS cohorts, though its historical anti-malarial application has waned due to resistance. The pharmacological mechanism centers on the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, disrupting protozoal DNA synthesis and cell replication. Clinically, the oral administration of pyrimethamine necessitates vigilance due to adverse effects, notably gastrointestinal distress, hypersensitivity reactions, and potential for bone marrow suppression, contraindicating its application in folate-deficient anemia. Oncology concerns persist about its carcinogenic potential, and its teratogenicity risk mandates caution during gestation.

The pharmacokinetics of dobutamine are characterized by rapid onset within two minutes and an elimination half-life of two minutes, necessitating titration to effect and favoring short-term administration, although it may be employed in extended durations in the context of pre-transplant heart failure symptomatology management. Adverse reactions primarily include tachyarrhythmias, injection site reactions, and contraindication in hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Synthetically derived from isoproterenol, dobutamine has been devoid of significant chronotropic effects, making it distinct among inotropes.\n\nPROTEIN NAME: ADRB1\nPROTEIN BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The beta-1 adrenergic receptor (\u03b21 adrenoceptor), also known as ADRB1, can refer to either the protein-encoding gene (gene ADRB1) or one of the four adrenergic receptors.

While its ophthalmic formulation is indicated for acute intervention in angle-closure glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and primary open-angle glaucoma, its utility is limited in chronic management due to adverse effects such as ocular irritation, lacrimation increase, cephalalgia, and transient visual disturbances, with potential complications including retinal detachment and hypersensitivity reactions. Pilocarpine's pharmacodynamics involve onset within one hour with effects persisting up to 24 hours. Systemic administration is employed in xerostomia management secondary to Sj\u00f6gren syndrome or post-radiation sequelae. Nonetheless, its use contraindicated during pregnancy underscores its safety profile concerns. Initially derived from Pilocarpus spp., pilocarpine remains inextricably linked to its historical provenance yet maintains its clinical relevance as delineated in the WHO Essential Medicines list.\n\nPROTEIN NAME: CHRM1\nPROTEIN BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, also known as the cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1, is a muscarinic receptor that in humans is encoded by the CHRM1 gene. It is localized to 11q13.\nThis receptor is found mediating slow EPSP at the ganglion in the postganglionic nerve, is common in exocrine glands and in the CNS.\nIt is predominantly found bound to G proteins of class Gq that use upregulation of phospholipase C and, therefore, inositol trisphosphate and intracellular calcium as a signalling pathway. A receptor so bound would not be susceptible to CTX or PTX. However, Gi (causing a downstream decrease in cAMP) and Gs (causing an increase in cAMP) have also been shown to be involved in interactions in certain tissues, and so would be susceptible to PTX and CTX respectively.\n\nDRUG-PROTEIN INTERACTION TRIPLE (subject-predicate-object): Pilocarpine-binding and activation-CHRM1"}]}}

Its pharmacotherapeutic action, analogous to tolterodine, darifenacin, and solifenacin, renders it a superior first-line therapeutic option due to its robust safety and efficacy profile over prolonged usage, despite plausible off-label utilizations in hyperhidrosis management. Contrarily, its application for pediatric nocturnal enuresis has seen diminished prevalence, given its questionable efficacy. Administrable orally or transdermally, oxybutynin's pharmacokinetic profile necessitates vigilance regarding adverse effects such as xerostomia, gastrointestinal hypomotility, and thermoregulatory dysfunction, encompassing severe sequelae like urinary retention and thermophilic impairments manifesting as heat stroke. Its teratogenic and lactogenic safety paradigms remain speculative, underscoring the need for judicious administration during pregnancy and lactation. As a generically available pharmacologic entity, it maintains substantial prescription frequency, embodying a pivotal role in managing cholinergic-mediated urological disorders.\n\nPROTEIN NAME: CHRM1\nPROTEIN BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, also known as the cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1, is a muscarinic receptor that in humans is encoded by the CHRM1 gene.

Its pharmacodynamics establish a clinical efficacy for enhancing executive functions such as attentional control, inhibitory processes, working memory, and emotional regulation, albeit with a slightly reduced efficacy compared to amphetamines. Pharmacokinetically, methylphenidate is amenable to both oral and transdermal administration with formulation-dependent pharmacokinetics dictating therapeutic windows. Adverse effects span neuropsychiatric and autonomic domains, including, but not limited to, sympathomimetic manifestations such as tachycardia, euphoria, anorexia, and insomnia, while withdrawal is typified by dysphoric and neurovegetative symptoms.

In the CNS, they induce emesis. Muscarinic M3 receptors are expressed in regions of the brain that regulate insulin homeostasis, such as the hypothalamus and dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem. These receptors are highly expressed on pancreatic beta cells and are critical regulators of glucose homoestasis by modulating insulin secretion. In general, they cause smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions.\nThey are unresponsive to PTX and CTX.\n\nDRUG-PROTEIN INTERACTION TRIPLE (subject-predicate-object): Desipramine-binding and inhibition-CHRM3"}]}}
