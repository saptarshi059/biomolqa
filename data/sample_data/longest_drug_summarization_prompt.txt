DRUG NAME: Lamotrigine
PUBMED ABSTRACTS: Abstract 1: BACKGROUND: Maternal use of valproate during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Although most studies of other antiseizure medications have not shown increased risks of these disorders, there are limited and conflicting data regarding the risk of autism spectrum disorder associated with maternal topiramate use. METHODS: We identified a population-based cohort of pregnant women and their children within two health care utilization databases in the United States, with data from 2000 through 2020. Exposure to specific antiseizure medications was defined on the basis of prescription fills from gestational week 19 until delivery. Children who had been exposed to topiramate during the second half of pregnancy were compared with those unexposed to any antiseizure medication during pregnancy with respect to the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Valproate was used as a positive control, and lamotrigine was used as a negative control. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative incidence of autism spectrum disorder at 8 years of age was 1.9% for the full population of children who had not been exposed to antiseizure medication (4,199,796 children). With restriction to children born to mothers with epilepsy, the incidence was 4.2% with no exposure to antiseizure medication (8815 children), 6.2% with exposure to topiramate (1030 children), 10.5% with exposure to valproate (800 children), and 4.1% with exposure to lamotrigine (4205 children). Propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios in a comparison with no exposure to antiseizure medication were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.65) for exposure to topiramate, 2.67 (95% CI, 1.69 to 4.20) for exposure to valproate, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.46) for exposure to lamotrigine. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of autism spectrum disorder was higher among children prenatally exposed to the studied antiseizure medications than in the general population. However, after adjustment for indication and other confounders, the association was substantially attenuated for topiramate and lamotrigine, whereas an increased risk remained for valproate.

Abstract 2: BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental disorder with repetitive mania/hypomania as well as depressive episodes, which eventually results in marked impairment in overall functioning and health-related quality of life.  A worldwide prevalence rate of 2.4% has been reported. The risk of suicide is higher in people with bipolar disorder than those with other mental disorders. Therefore, effective management of bipolar disorder in the maintenance period is warranted to minimize the risk of relapse or recurrence. Although lithium has been the standard treatment of bipolar disorder for many years, it is associated with adverse effects and teratogenicity. Lamotrigine is approved to be expected for prevention of recurrence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. In addition, lamotrigine is as effective as lithium. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to confirm the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialized Register (CCMDCTR) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to 21 May 2021. We also searched international trial registries and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with bipolar disorder who were treated with lamotrigine, placebo or lithium. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviews authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardized form. Data extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in the term of efficacy and tolerability. Study information were then entered into RevMan web. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies with a total of 2314 participants in this review; 1146 were randomized to lamotrigine, 869 were randomized to placebo and, 299 to lithium. We rated all studies as having an unclear risk of bias in at least one domain of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias, with the most commonly observed weakness being selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment). We judged five studies to be at a high risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). These potential biases pose as major threat to the validity of the included studies in this review. Outcomes of efficacy showed a possible advantage of lamotrigine over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for recurrence of manic symptom at one year as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was 0.67, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87; 3 studies, 663 participants; low-certainty evidence) in favor of lamotrigine. The RR of clinical worsening with the need for additional psychotropic treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 4 studies, 756 participants) based on moderate-certainty evidence. The possible benefits of lamotrigine were also seen for the outcome of treatment withdrawal due to any reason at 6-12 months after treatment (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 4 studies, 700 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Regarding tolerability, our analyses showed that the incidence rates of adverse effects were similar between the lamotrigine group and the placebo group (short-term effect: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42; 5 studies, 1138 participants; very low-certainty evidence; long-term effect: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 4 studies, 756 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In the comparison between lamotrigine and lithium, efficacy was similar between groups except for recurrence of mania episode at one year. Recurrence of manic symptoms was higher in the lamotrigine group than that of the lithium group (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.44; 3 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Analysis of adverse effects at 6-12 months showed that a lower proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with lamotrigine compared to lithium (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; 4 studies, 691 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low- to moderate-certainty evidence collectively suggests that lamotrigine may be superior to placebo as a treatment modality for bipolar disorder. In comparison to lithium, people with bipolar disorder seem to tolerate lamotrigine better in the long run; however, the demonstrated efficacy in the maintenance of bipolar disorder was similar between the two groups.

Abstract 3: CONTEXT: Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant commonly used to treat seizure and bipolar mood disorders. Evidence from case series and retrospective studies indicate that lamotrigine overdose is usually benign. However, there are reported cases of cardiac arrest and mortality following lamotrigine overdose. We undertook a systematic review of the literature on lamotrigine overdoses to better understand the clinical severity, the relevance of serum concentrations, and therapeutic interventions for overdose. OBJECTIVES: To characterize manifestations of acute lamotrigine overdose, determine if serum concentrations predict poisoning severity, and evaluate the effectiveness of overdose management interventions. METHODS: We performed a literature search across eight databases, including Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, from database inception to April 2014. Major bibliographic databases were updated on 31 May 2017. Articles were eligible if they described acute or acute on chronic lamotrigine overdose. At least one serum lamotrigine concentration had to be reported for inclusion. Reports on chronic poisoning, studies describing adverse effects of therapeutic use, and animal studies were excluded. RESULTS: We retrieved 6238 records; 48 (51 cases) met the inclusion criteria. Cases primarily involved adults (70.6%). Potentially life-threatening symptoms of overdose included seizures (55%), Glasgow Coma Scale </=8 (20%), hypotension (12%), and wide complex tachycardia (WCT) and cardiac arrest (6%). Among the 25 cases exposed to lamotrigine alone (13 adult; 12 pediatric), 2 adult fatalities occurred (4 g and 7.5 g ingested) and 8 pediatric cases experienced seizures (all children </=3.5-years-old, 75% without an underlying seizure disorder, >/= 525 mg ingested). The lowest seizure-associated serum concentration was 3.8 mg/L and 25.6 mg/L for pediatric and adult patients, respectively, suggesting children may be more susceptible to CNS toxicity. Cardiovascular toxicities occurred primarily in adult patients (threshold >25 mg/L). Overdose interventions included benzodiazepines (53%), propofol or barbiturates (14%), NaHCO(3) (20%), lipid therapy (12%), and extracorporeal elimination (10%). NaHCO(3) yielded no response in four of nine cases with conduction delays; however, two of the four cases subsequently responded with lipid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases reporting lamotrigine exposures observed mild or no toxicity; however, large exposures were associated with severe CNS depression, seizures, cardiac conduction delays, wide complex tachycardia, and death. In adults with a serum concentration >25 mg/L, severe toxicity may occur. In patients </=3.5 years of age, ingestions of >/=525 mg may produce severe CNS depression and seizures.

Abstract 4: IMPORTANCE: After the recent limitations to prescribing valproate, many studies have highlighted the challenging management of female patients of reproductive age with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). However, no study, to the authors' knowledge, has addressed the comparative effectiveness of alternative antiseizure medications (ASMs) in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of levetiracetam and lamotrigine as initial monotherapy in female patients of childbearing age with IGE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, comparative effectiveness cohort study analyzing data from patients followed up from 1994 to 2022. Patients were recruited from 22 primary, secondary, and tertiary adult and child epilepsy centers from 4 countries. Eligible patients were female individuals of childbearing age, diagnosed with IGE according to International League Against Epilepsy (2022) criteria and who initiated levetiracetam or lamotrigine as initial monotherapy. Patients were excluded due to insufficient follow-up after ASM prescription. EXPOSURES: Levetiracetam or lamotrigine as initial monotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to compare treatment failure (TF) among patients who received levetiracetam or lamotrigine as initial monotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 543 patients were included in the study, with a median (IQR) age at ASM prescription of 17 (15-21) years and a median (IQR) follow-up of 60 (24-108) months. Of the study population, 312 patients (57.5%) were prescribed levetiracetam, and 231 (42.5%) were prescribed lamotrigine. An IPTW-adjusted Cox model showed that levetiracetam was associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure after adjustment for all baseline variables (IPTW-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99; P = .04). However, after stratification according to different IGE syndromes, the higher effectiveness of levetiracetam was confirmed only in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME; IPTW-adjusted HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.68; P < .001), whereas no significant differences were found in other syndromes. Patients treated with levetiracetam experienced adverse effects more frequently compared with those treated with lamotrigine (88 of 312 [28.2%] vs 42 of 231 [18.1%]), whereas the 2 ASMs had similar retention rates during follow-up (IPTW-adjusted HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.65-1.23; P = .60). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this comparative effectiveness research study suggest the use of levetiracetam as initial alternative monotherapy in female patients with JME. Further studies are needed to identify the most effective ASM alternative in other IGE syndromes.

Abstract 5: Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a common pediatric epilepsy syndrome with distinct seizure semiology, electroencephalography (EEG) features, and treatment. A diagnosis of CAE can be obtained during an office visit with a careful history, physical exam including prolonged hyperventilation, and a routine EEG. The treatment of choice for CAE with absence seizures only is ethosuximide. Valproic acid and lamotrigine are also effective treatments for many patients, but when compared to ethosuximide, valproic acid has more adverse effects and lamotrigine is less effective. Attention to predictors of response to treatment, including clinical, electrographic, and genetic factors, is increasing. Refractory CAE occurs in fewer than half of patients, and treatment strategies are available, though efficacy data are lacking. Careful assessment and treatment of psychosocial comorbidities is essential in caring for patients with CAE.

Abstract 6: BACKGROUND: Levetiracetam and zonisamide are licensed as monotherapy for patients with focal epilepsy, but there is uncertainty as to whether they should be recommended as first-line treatments because of insufficient evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with lamotrigine in people with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, controlled trial compared levetiracetam and zonisamide with lamotrigine as first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked focal seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factor to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide. Participants and investigators were not masked and were aware of treatment allocation. SANAD II was designed to assess non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide to lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. Anti-seizure medications were taken orally and for participants aged 12 years or older the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine 50 mg (morning) and 100 mg (evening), levetiracetam 500 mg twice per day, and zonisamide 100 mg twice per day. For children aged between 5 and 12 years the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine 1.5 mg/kg twice per day, levetiracetam 20 mg/kg twice per day, and zonisamide 2.5 mg/kg twice per day. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The per-protocol (PP) analysis excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analysis included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.329, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on lamotrigine. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64). FINDINGS: 990 participants were recruited between May 2, 2013, and June 20, 2017, and followed up for a further 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (n=330), levetiracetam (n=332), or zonisamide (n=328). The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 324 participants randomly assigned to lamotrigine, 320 participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam, and 315 participants randomly assigned to zonisamide. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission versus lamotrigine (HR 1.18; 97.5% CI 0.95-1.47) but zonisamide did meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis versus lamotrigine (1.03; 0.83-1.28). The PP analysis showed that 12-month remission was superior with lamotrigine than both levetiracetam (HR 1.32 [97.5% CI 1.05 to 1.66]) and zonisamide (HR 1.37 [1.08-1.73]). There were 37 deaths during the trial. Adverse reactions were reported by 108 (33%) participants who started lamotrigine, 144 (44%) participants who started levetiracetam, and 146 (45%) participants who started zonisamide. Lamotrigine was superior in the cost-utility analysis, with a higher net health benefit of 1.403 QALYs (97.5% central range 1.319-1.458) compared with 1.222 (1.110-1.283) for levetiracetam and 1.232 (1.112, 1.307) for zonisamide at a cost-effectiveness threshold of  pound20 000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and QALYs. INTERPRETATION: These findings do not support the use of levetiracetam or zonisamide as first-line treatments for patients with focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine should remain a first-line treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and should be the standard treatment in future trials.

Abstract 7: OBJECTIVES: Rapid cycling is a common and disabling phenomenon in individuals with bipolar disorders. In the absence of a recent literature examination, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise the evidence of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of treatments for individuals with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (RCBD). METHOD: A systematic search was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials assigning participants with RCBD to pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions. Study inclusion and data extraction were undertaken by two reviewers independently. The primary outcome was continuous within-subject RCBD illness severity before and after treatment. Pre-post random effects meta-analyses were conducted for each outcome/intervention arm studied, generating a standardised effect size (hedge's g) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 34 articles describing 30 studies were included. A total of 16 separate pharmacological treatments were examined in contrast to 1 psychological therapy study. Only quetiapine and lamotrigine were assessed in >5 studies. By assessing 95% CI overlap of within-subject efficacy effects compared to placebo, the only interventions suggesting significant depression benefits (placebo g = 0.60) were olanzapine (with/without fluoxetine; g = 1.01), citalopram (g = 1.10) and venlafaxine (g = 2.48). For mania, benefits were indicated for quetiapine (g = 1.01), olanzapine (g = 1.19) and aripiprazole (g = 1.09), versus placebo (g = 0.33). Most of these effect sizes were from only one trial per treatment. Heterogeneity between studies was variable, and 20% were rated to have a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: While many interventions appeared efficacious, there was a lack of robust evidence for most treatments. Given the limited and heterogeneous evidence base, the optimal treatment strategies for people with RCBD are yet to be established.

Abstract 8: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) may improve or be detrimental to sleep. A literature review (as an update to the 2014 review by Jain and Glauser [https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.12478]) of 25 ASMs of interest (articles from 12 ASMs included) on the effect of ASMs/non-drug treatments on sleep in patients with epilepsy was conducted. The most common objective instrument was polysomnography, and the most common subjective measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, and perampanel improved or had no effect on sleep. Perampanel was associated with low incidence of insomnia, and lacosamide with low incidence of daytime sleepiness adverse events. Clonazepam, felbamate, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and phenobarbital worsened or had no effect on sleep. Lamotrigine may be associated with insomnia risk and phenobarbital with daytime sleepiness. Data for valproic acid were mixed. Overall, cannabidiol, carbamazepine, and levetiracetam had no effect on sleep. Epilepsy surgery may benefit sleep in patients with a good surgical outcome. Some ASMs, and, possibly, epilepsy surgery, may have positive effects on sleep, possibly linked to achieving seizure control. Nonetheless, other ASMs may worsen sleep in some settings. Clinicians should consider such observations when making treatment decisions, particularly for patients with comorbid sleep disorders.

Abstract 9: OBJECTIVES: Rapid cycling is a phase of bipolar disorder with increased episode frequencies. It is a severe and disabling condition that often poses a major challenge to the clinician. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the evidence-based treatment options for rapid cycling. METHODS: A systematic search on Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases from inception until December 2021 was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. An additional search on clinicaltrials.gov was done. References of retrieved papers and key reviews were hand-searched. Randomized controlled trials including at least 10 patients with bipolar disorder, rapid cycling, reporting an objective outcome measure were selected. RESULTS: Our search, initially revealing 1330 articles, resulted in 16 papers about treatment of an acute mood episode, relapse prevention or both. Lithium, anticonvulsants, second generation antipsychotics, antidepressants and thyroid hormone were assessed as treatment options in the presented data. Evidence supporting the use of aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, valproate and lamotrigine for treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorder was found. LIMITATIONS: Small sample sizes, different index episodes and variety of outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding treatment of rapid cycling remains scarce. Evidence supports the use of aripiprazole, olanzapine, and valproate for acute manic or mixed episodes, quetiapine for acute depressive episodes and aripiprazole and lamotrigine for relapse prevention. Given the paucity of available evidence, and the burden that accompanies rapid cycling, future research is warranted.

Abstract 10: Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a chronic mental disorder, characterised by mood swings, alternating between depression and manic or hypomanic episodes. Unfortunately, in some patients pharmacological treatment does not bring satisfactory results, and a certain group of patients shows resistance to treatment. Therefore, other treatment methods are sought after, including a change in diet. The most promising nutrition model is the ketogenic diet. In the presented case study of a male patient, thanks to the introduction of the ketogenic diet, full remission of the disease was achieved, doses of lamotrigine were reduced and quetiapine was completely discontinued. Previously, neither lamotrigine monotherapy nor combined treatment with quetiapine achieved euthymia. The effects of the diet may be related to, among others, the influence on ionic channels and increase in blood acidity (similarly to mood stabilisers), increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration, modulation of GABAA receptors and blocking of AMPA receptors by medium-chain fatty acids. The ketogenic diet influences glutamate metabolism and nerve cell metabolism, which uses ketone bodies as energy sources. Ketosis can also stimulate the biogenesis of mitochondria, improve brain metabolism, act as a neuroprotective factor, as well as increase glutathione synthesis and reduce oxidative stress. However, there is a need for carefully planned studies, with an appropriate representative group, to verify the potential benefits and risks of introducing the ketogenic diet in patients with BPAD.

Abstract 11: OBJECTIVES: The augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) can be achieved by add-on therapy with different pharmacological agents in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for a better clinical outcome. This network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to evaluate and compare the effects of available augmentation agents for SRIs in OCD. METHOD: The data was extracted from 59 relevant clinical trials after a literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane databases and clinical trial registries. PRISMA guidelines were followed in data extraction, analysis and reporting. Random effects Bayesian NMA was done to pool the effects across the interventions for the change in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scoring from baseline to the end of the study. Network graph was built, consistency model was run, node splitting analysis was performed, treatments were ranked as per SUCRA score and meta-regression was done for refractoriness to SRIs and duration of augmentation therapy as the predictor variables. RESULTS: The drugs showing significant reduction in YBOCS scoring were pregabalin (MD:-8.1;95% CrI: -16, -0.43), memantine (MD:-6.2;95% CrI: -9.9, -2.3), lamotrigine (MD:-6;95% CrI: -12, -0.47), ondansetron (MD:-5.7;95% CrI: -11, -0.67), granisetron (MD:-5.6;95% CrI: -11, -0.44), aripiprazole (MD:-5.4;95% CrI:-9.1, -1.6), risperidone (MD:-3.3;95% CrI: -6.4, -0.20) and topiramate (MD:-5.3;95% CrI: -9.6, -0.97). The node-split analysis showed that direct and indirect pooled effect sizes for all comparisons were comparable. Meta-regression showed a statistically non-significant association between YBOCS score reduction with the duration of augmentation therapy, but significant with SRI-refractory status. Finally, the results were sorted based on certainty of evidence. CONCLUSION: Memantine was found to be most effective augmentation agent for SRIs in OCD, followed by lamotrigine, ondansetron and granisetron with moderate certainty of evidence. The augmentation agents showed better symptom reduction in patients with SRI-refractory OCD in comparison to non-refractory OCD. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42022360110.

Abstract 12: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Valproate should be avoided in pregnancy, but it is the most effective drug for generalized epilepsies. Alternative treatment may require combinations of other drugs. Our objectives were to describe first trimester use of antiseizure medication (ASM) combinations that are relevant alternatives to valproate and determine whether specific combinations were associated with a lower risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) compared with valproate monotherapy. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using linked national registers from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden and administrative health care data from the United States and New South Wales, Australia. We described first trimester use of ASM combinations among pregnant people with epilepsy from 2000 to 2020. We compared the risk of MCM after first trimester exposure to ASM combinations vs valproate monotherapy and low-dose valproate plus lamotrigine or levetiracetam vs high-dose valproate (>/=1,000 mg/d). We used log-binomial regression with propensity score weights to calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs for each dataset. Results were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 50,905 pregnancies in people with epilepsy identified from 7.8 million total pregnancies, 788 used lamotrigine and levetiracetam, 291 used lamotrigine and topiramate, 208 used levetiracetam and topiramate, 80 used lamotrigine and zonisamide, and 91 used levetiracetam and zonisamide. After excluding pregnancies with use of other ASMs, known teratogens, or a child diagnosed with MCM of infectious or genetic cause, we compared 587 exposed to lamotrigine-levetiracetam duotherapy and 186 exposed to lamotrigine-topiramate duotherapy with 1959 exposed to valproate monotherapy. Pooled aRRs were 0.41 (95% CI 0.24-0.69) and 1.26 (0.71-2.23), respectively. Duotherapy combinations containing low-dose valproate were infrequent, and comparisons with high-dose valproate monotherapy were inconclusive but suggested a lower risk for combination therapy. Other combinations were too rare for comparative safety analyses. DISCUSSION: Lamotrigine-levetiracetam duotherapy in first trimester was associated with a 60% lower risk of MCM than valproate monotherapy, while lamotrigine-topiramate was not associated with a reduced risk. Duotherapy with lamotrigine and levetiracetam may be favored to treat epilepsy in people with childbearing potential compared with valproate regarding MCM, but whether this combination is as effective as valproate remains to be determined. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in people with epilepsy treated in the first trimester of pregnancy, the risk of major congenital malformations is lower with lamotrigine-levetiracetam duotherapy than with valproate alone, but similar with lamotrigine-topiramate.

Abstract 13: BACKGROUND: Levetiracetam (Keppra((R)), UCB Pharma Ltd, Slough, UK) and zonisamide (Zonegran((R)), Eisai Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) are licensed as monotherapy for focal epilepsy, and levetiracetam is increasingly used as a first-line treatment for generalised epilepsy, particularly for women of childbearing age. However, there is uncertainty as to whether or not they should be recommended as first-line treatments owing to a lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine (Lamictal((R)), GlaxoSmithKline plc, Brentford, UK) (standard treatment) with levetiracetam and zonisamide (new treatments) for focal epilepsy, and to compare valproate (Epilim((R)), Sanofi SA, Paris, France) (standard treatment) with levetiracetam (new treatment) for generalised and unclassified epilepsy. DESIGN: Two pragmatic randomised unblinded non-inferiority trials run in parallel. SETTING: Outpatient services in NHS hospitals throughout the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Those aged >/= 5 years with two or more spontaneous seizures that require anti-seizure medication. INTERVENTIONS: Participants with focal epilepsy were randomised to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam or zonisamide. Participants with generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy were randomised to receive valproate or levetiracetam. The randomisation method was minimisation using a web-based program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to 12-month remission from seizures. For this outcome, and all other time-to-event outcomes, we report hazard ratios for the standard treatment compared with the new treatment. For the focal epilepsy trial, the non-inferiority limit (lamotrigine vs. new treatments) was 1.329. For the generalised and unclassified epilepsy trial, the non-inferiority limit (valproate vs. new treatments) was 1.314. Secondary outcomes included time to treatment failure, time to first seizure, time to 24-month remission, adverse reactions, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Focal epilepsy. A total of 990 participants were recruited, of whom 330 were randomised to receive lamotrigine, 332 were randomised to receive levetiracetam and 328 were randomised to receive zonisamide. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority (hazard ratio 1.329) in the primary intention-to-treat analysis of time to 12-month remission (hazard ratio vs. lamotrigine 1.18, 97.5% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.47), but zonisamide did meet the criteria (hazard ratio vs. lamotrigine 1.03, 97.5% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.28). In the per-protocol analysis, lamotrigine was superior to both levetiracetam (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.66) and zonisamide (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.73). For time to treatment failure, lamotrigine was superior to levetiracetam (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.77) and zonisamide (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.60). Adverse reactions were reported by 33% of participants starting lamotrigine, 44% starting levetiracetam and 45% starting zonisamide. In the economic analysis, both levetiracetam and zonisamide were more costly and less effective than lamotrigine and were therefore dominated. Generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy. Of 520 patients recruited, 260 were randomised to receive valproate and 260 were randomised to receive to levetiracetam. A total of 397 patients had generalised epilepsy and 123 had unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the primary intention-to-treat analysis of time to 12-month remission (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.47; non-inferiority margin 1.314). In the per-protocol analysis of time to 12-month remission, valproate was superior to levetiracetam (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 2.15). Valproate was superior to levetiracetam for time to treatment failure (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.83). Adverse reactions were reported by 37.4% of participants receiving valproate and 41.5% of those receiving levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was both more costly (incremental cost of  pound104, 95% central range - pound587 to  pound1234) and less effective (incremental quality-adjusted life-year of -0.035, 95% central range -0.137 to 0.032) than valproate, and was therefore dominated. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of  pound20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, levetiracetam was associated with a probability of 0.17 of being cost-effective. LIMITATIONS: The SANAD II trial was unblinded, which could have biased results by influencing decisions about dosing, treatment failure and the attribution of adverse reactions. FUTURE WORK: SANAD II data could now be included in an individual participant meta-analysis of similar trials, and future similar trials are required to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of other new treatments, including lacosamide and perampanel. CONCLUSIONS: Focal epilepsy - The SANAD II findings do not support the use of levetiracetam or zonisamide as first-line treatments in focal epilepsy. Generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy - The SANAD II findings do not support the use of levetiracetam as a first-line treatment for newly diagnosed generalised epilepsy. For women of childbearing potential, these results inform discussions about the benefit (lower teratogenicity) and harm (worse seizure outcomes and higher treatment failure rate) of levetiracetam compared with valproate.

Abstract 14: OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to examine the comparative safety of antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy in pregnancy with respect to risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs), overall and by MCM subtype. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using national health register data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (1996-2020). We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM-unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was nongenetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights. RESULTS: There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n = 8,339) compared to ASM-unexposed pregnancies (n = 4,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.87-1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n = 2,031, aRR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.70-2.46) and topiramate (n = 509, aRR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.26-2.60), which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n = 2,674, aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.72-1.15), oxcarbazepine (n = 1,313, aRR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.83-1.44), or levetiracetam (n = 1,040, aRR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.53-1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes, including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias, whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not. INTERPRETATION: Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:551-562.

Abstract 15: OBJECTIVE: To provide up-to-date clinical guidance on the efficacy of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder (BD). METHODS: Eligible studies were identified during a systematic literature search according to PRISMA-guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that quantitatively assessed lamotrigine's efficacy in BD. We divided the included studies into three groups: 1. acute treatment of depression, 2. acute treatment of mania and hypomania, and 3. maintenance treatment. Analyses were stratified by control group (placebo vs active comparator) and treatment strategy (monotherapy vs add-on treatment). RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs (n = 1166 lamotrigine users) and 20 cohort studies (n = 11,141 lamotrigine users). Twenty-four of these studies were included in meta-analyses. During depressive episodes, greater decreases in depressive symptomatology were associated with initiation of lamotrigine as add-on treatment than with placebo (SMD -0.30 [95% CI = -0.51, -0.10], df = 3, p = 0.004). Decreases in depressive symptomatology did not differ significantly between lamotrigine and the active comparator (SMD -0.28 [95% CI = -1.06, 0.50], df = 3, p = 0.488). As a maintenance treatment, lamotrigine was associated with a significantly lower relapse/recurrence rate than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84 [95% CI = 0.71, 0.99], df = 2, p = 0.037). Relapse/recurrence rates did not differ significantly between lamotrigine and lithium (RR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.89, 1.25], df = 2, p = 0.513). A qualitative assessment of high-quality register-based studies found that lamotrigine was associated with lower hospital admission rates than other commonly used treatment regimes. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial evidence for the efficacy of lamotrigine in BD, specifically as add-on treatment during acute depressive episodes and as maintenance treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence.

Abstract 16: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Systematic screening can help identify antiseizure medication (ASM)-associated adverse events (AEs) that may preclude patients from reaching effective doses or completing adequate trial periods. The Adverse Event Profile (AEP) is a self-completed instrument to identify the frequency of common AEs associated with ASM use. This study aimed to compare the AE profile of commonly used ASMs in adults with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. METHODS: The Human Epilepsy Project is a prospective, international, observational study investigating markers of treatment response in newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Participants were enrolled within 4 months of treatment initiation. Adult participants on levetiracetam, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine monotherapy who completed the AEP and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at enrollment were included. Multivariable generalized linear and penalized logistic regression models assessed differences in total and itemized marginal AEP scores and dichotomized responses ("never/rarely" vs "sometimes/always"). RESULTS: A total of 225 adults initiated on levetiracetam (n = 132, 59%), lamotrigine (n = 55, 24%), carbamazepine (n = 19, 8.4%), or oxcarbazepine (n = 19, 8.4%) were included. There were no significant differences in AEP total scores between ASMs. Patients with depression (adjusted marginal score ratio [aMSR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.39, p = 0.001) and anxiety (aMSR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.26, p = 0.007) had worse AEP total scores than those without. After adjusting for depression and anxiety, levetiracetam users were >3 times more likely to report feelings of aggression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.38, 95% CI 1.07-10.7, p = 0.038) and almost half as likely to experience unsteadiness (aOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.99, p = 0.047) than lamotrigine users. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine had the highest rates of discontinuation (42.1%, each), followed by levetiracetam (34.8%) and lamotrigine (16.4%). Levetiracetam users had the highest proportion of discontinuations because of AEs alone (18%), and lamotrigine had the lowest (5%). DISCUSSION: Systematic screening for AEs in adults with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy on ASM monotherapy showed that those with comorbid psychiatric conditions report greater AEs overall, irrespective of ASM. Levetiracetam was associated with >3-fold risk of psychiatric AEs and half the risk of experiencing unsteadiness than lamotrigine. Levetiracetam had the highest proportion of discontinuations because of AEs alone, while lamotrigine had the lowest.

Abstract 17: IMPORTANCE: Precise estimation of a patient's drug metabolism capacity is important for antiseizure dose personalization. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the differences in plasma concentrations for antiseizure drugs associated with variants of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Clinicaltrialsregister.eu, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and CENTRAL databases were screened for studies from January 1, 1990, to September 30, 2023, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers performed independent study screening and assessed the following inclusion criteria: appropriate genotyping was performed, genotype-based categorization into subgroups was possible, and each subgroup contained at least 3 participants. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed for data extraction and subsequent quality, validity, and risk-of-bias assessments. The results from the included studies were pooled with random-effect meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma concentrations of antiseizure drugs were quantified with the dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curve, the dose-normalized steady state concentration, or the concentrations after a single dose at standardized dose and sampling time. The ratio of the means was calculated by dividing the mean drug plasma concentrations of carriers and noncarriers of the pharmacogenetic variant. RESULTS: Data from 98 studies involving 12 543 adult participants treated with phenytoin, valproate, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine were analyzed. Studies were mainly conducted within East Asian (69 studies) or White or European (15 studies) cohorts. Significant increases of plasma concentrations compared with the reference subgroup were observed for phenytoin, by 46% (95% CI, 33%-61%) in CYP2C9 intermediate metabolizers, 20% (95% CI, 17%-30%) in CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers, and 39% (95% CI, 24%-56%) in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers; for valproate, by 12% (95% CI, 4%-20%) in CYP2C9 intermediate metabolizers, 12% (95% CI, 2%-24%) in CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers, and 20% (95% CI, 2%-41%) in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers; and for carbamazepine, by 12% (95% CI, 3%-22%) in CYP3A5 poor metabolizers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genotypes encoding low enzymatic capacity were associated with a clinically relevant increase in phenytoin plasma concentrations, several pharmacogenetic variants were associated with statistically significant but only marginally clinically relevant changes in valproate and carbamazepine plasma concentrations, and numerous pharmacogenetic variants were not associated with statistically significant differences in plasma concentrations of antiseizure drugs.
