PUBMED ABSTRACTS: Abstract 1: Combination therapy, a treatment modality that combines two or more therapeutic agents, is a cornerstone of cancer therapy. The amalgamation of anti-cancer drugs enhances efficacy compared to the mono-therapy approach because it targets key pathways in a characteristically synergistic or an additive manner. This approach potentially reduces drug resistance, while simultaneously providing therapeutic anti-cancer benefits, such as reducing tumour growth and metastatic potential, arresting mitotically active cells, reducing cancer stem cell populations, and inducing apoptosis. The 5-year survival rates for most metastatic cancers are still quite low, and the process of developing a new anti-cancer drug is costly and extremely time-consuming. Therefore, new strategies that target the survival pathways that provide efficient and effective results at an affordable cost are being considered. One such approach incorporates repurposing therapeutic agents initially used for the treatment of different diseases other than cancer. This approach is effective primarily when the FDA-approved agent targets similar pathways found in cancer. Because one of the drugs used in combination therapy is already FDA-approved, overall costs of combination therapy research are reduced. This increases cost efficiency of therapy, thereby benefiting the "medically underserved". In addition, an approach that combines repurposed pharmaceutical agents with other therapeutics has shown promising results in mitigating tumour burden. In this systematic review, we discuss important pathways commonly targeted in cancer therapy. Furthermore, we also review important repurposed or primary anti-cancer agents that have gained popularity in clinical trials and research since 2012.

Abstract 2: Hypoxia and acidity provide microenvironment for selection under evolutionary pressure and proliferation in cancer cells. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a superfamily of metalloenzymes present in all life kingdoms, equilibrating the reactions among CO(2), bicarbonate and H(+). CA9, a membrane-associated alpha-CA, has been a drug target for various cancers. Whereas iron is essential not only for cancer cells but also for all the lives on earth, little is known on the association among hypoxia, iron metabolism, extracellular acidity and redox regulation. Malignant mesothelioma (MM), an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis, is an intriguing model in that asbestos-associated pathogenesis includes excess iron environment during carcinogenesis. Re-analysis of rat asbestos-induced MM model revealed an inverse association between high CA9 expression and survival. Here we used human MMs to identify the molecular events surrounding CA9 from the viewpoint of iron metabolism. CA9 expression was significantly higher in MM cells than in MeT-5A mesothelial cells, which was further amplified under hypoxia (1%O(2)) with increased catalytic Fe(II). CA9 suppression by inhibitors (S4 and U104) decreased viability and migration of MM cells, accompanied by overexpression of TFRC, IREB1/2 and FPN1(SLC40A1) and by downregulation of FTH/FTL. This expressional pattern was similar to that of erastin-induced ferroptosis in the same cells. Furthermore, we observed mitochondrial fission and enhanced autophagy with increased catalytic Fe(II) in both mitochondria and lysosomes after CA9 inhibition, accompanied by increased peroxides, mitochondrial O(2)(-) and lipid peroxidation. The eventual cell death was significantly inhibited by deferoxamine, ferrostatin-1 and Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting a mixed cell death of ferroptosis and apoptosis. Therefore, CA9 plays a role in equilibrating among hypoxia, iron metabolism and redox regulation in MM cells.

Abstract 3: IMPORTANCE: Obesity is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about the role that circulating protein biomarkers play in this association. OBJECTIVE: To examine the observational and genetic associations of adiposity with circulating protein biomarkers and the observational associations of proteins with incident CVD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This subcohort study included 628 participants from the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank who did not have a history of cancer at baseline. The Olink platform measured 92 protein markers in baseline plasma samples. Data were collected from June 2004 to January 2016 and analyzed from January 2019 to June 2020. EXPOSURES: Measured body mass index (BMI) obtained during the baseline survey and genetically instrumented BMI derived using 571 externally weighted single-nucleotide variants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cross-sectional associations of adiposity with biomarkers were examined using linear regression. Associations of biomarkers with CVD risk were assessed using Cox regression among those without prior cancer or CVD at baseline. Mendelian randomization was conducted to derive genetically estimated associations of BMI with biomarkers. FINDINGS: In observational analyses of 628 individuals (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [10.5] years; 385 women [61.3%]), BMI (mean [SD], 23.9 [3.6]) was positively associated with 27 proteins (per 1-SD higher BMI; eg, interleukin-6: 0.21 [95% CI, 0.12-0.29] SD; interleukin-18: 0.13 [95% CI, 0.05-0.21] SD; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1: 0.12 [95% CI, 0.04-0.20] SD; hepatocyte growth factor: 0.31 [95% CI, 0.24-0.39] SD), and inversely with 3 proteins (Fas ligand: -0.11 [95% CI, -0.19 to -0.03] SD; TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, -0.14 [95% CI, -0.23 to -0.06] SD; and carbonic anhydrase 9: (-0.14 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.05] SD), with similar associations identified for other adiposity traits (eg, waist circumference [r = 0.96]). In mendelian randomization, the associations of genetically elevated BMI with specific proteins were directionally consistent with the observational associations. In meta-analyses of genetically elevated BMI with 8 proteins, combining present estimates with previous studies, the most robust associations were shown for interleukin-6 (per 1-SD higher BMI; 0.21 [95% CI, 0.13-0.29] SD), interleukin-18 (0.16 [95% CI, 0.06-0.26] SD), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (0.21 [95% CI, 0.11-0.30] SD), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (0.12 [95% CI, 0.03-0.21] SD), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (0.23 [95% CI, 0.13-0.32] SD), and hepatocyte growth factor (0.14 [95% CI, 0.06-0.22] SD). Of the 30 BMI-associated biomarkers, 10 (including interleukin-6, interleukin-18, and hepatocyte growth factor) were nominally associated with incident CVD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mendelian randomization shows adiposity to be associated with a range of protein biomarkers, with some biomarkers also showing association with CVD risk. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings and assess whether proteins may be mediators between adiposity and CVD.

Abstract 4: Ovarian cancer is an aggressive gynecological tumor characterized by a high relapse rate and chemoresistance. Ovarian cancer exhibits the cancer hallmark of elevated glycolysis, yet effective strategies targeting cancer cell metabolic reprogramming to overcome therapeutic resistance in ovarian cancer remain elusive. Here, we revealed that epigenetic silencing of Otubain 2 (OTUB2) is a driving force for mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming in ovarian cancer, which promotes tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, OTUB2 silencing destabilizes sorting nexin 29 pseudogene 2 (SNX29P2), which subsequently prevents hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) from von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor-mediated degradation. Elevated HIF-1alpha activates the transcription of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and drives ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance by promoting glycolysis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CA9 substantially suppressed tumor growth and synergized with carboplatin in the treatment of OTUB2-silenced ovarian cancer. Thus, our study highlights the pivotal role of OTUB2/SNX29P2 in suppressing ovarian cancer development and proposes that targeting CA9-mediated glycolysis is an encouraging strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Abstract 5: BACKGROUND: With limitations of conventional imaging and biopsy, accurate, non-invasive techniques to detect clear-cell renal cell carcinoma in patients with renal masses remain an unmet need. (89)Zr-labelled monoclonal antibody ([(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab) has high affinity for carbonic anhydrase 9, a tumour antigen highly expressed in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab PET-CT imaging for detection and characterisation of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: ZIRCON was a prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial conducted at 36 research hospitals and practices across nine countries (the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK, Turkiye, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and France). Patients aged 18 years or older with an indeterminate renal mass 7 cm or smaller (cT1) suspicious for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and scheduled for nephrectomy received a single dose of [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab (37 MBq +/-10%; 10 mg girentuximab) intravenously followed by abdominal PET-CT imaging 5 days (+/-2 days) later. Surgery was performed no later than 90 days after administration of [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab. Blinded central review, conducted by three independent readers, determined the histology from surgical samples. The coprimary endpoints, determined for each individual reader, were the sensitivity and specificity of [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab PET-CT imaging to detect clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, with histopathological confirmation as standard of truth. Analyses were on the full analysis set of patients, defined as patients who had evaluable PET-CT imaging and a confirmed histopathological diagnosis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03849118, and EUDRA Clinical Trials Register, 2018-002773-21, and is closed to enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Aug 14, 2019, and July 8, 2022, 371 patients were screened for eligibility, 332 of whom were enrolled. 300 patients received [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab (214 [71%] male and 86 [29%] female). 284 (95%) evaluable patients were included in the primary analysis. The mean sensitivity was 85.5% (95% CI 81.5-89.6) and mean specificity was 87.0% (81.0-93.1). No safety signals were observed. Most adverse events were not or were unlikely to be related to [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab, with most (193 [74%] of 261 events) occurring during or after surgery. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were post-procedural haemorrhage (in six [2%] of 261 patients), urinary retention (three [1%]), and hypertension (three [1%]). In 25 (8%) of 300 patients, 52 serious adverse events were reported, of which 51 (98%) occurred after surgery. There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that [(89)Zr]Zr-girentuximab PET-CT has a favourable safety profile and is a highly accurate, non-invasive imaging modality for the detection and characterisation of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, which has the potential to be practice changing.

Abstract 6: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Maintenance of acid-base homeostasis is required for normal physiology, metabolism, and development. It is not clear how cell death is activated in response to changes in pH. We performed a screen to identify agents that induce cell death in a pH-dependent manner (we call this alkaliptosis) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) cells and tested their effects in mice. METHODS: We screened a library of 254 compounds that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to identify those with cytotoxic activity against a human PDAC cell line (PANC1). We evaluated the ability of JTC801, which binds the opiod receptor and has analgesic effects, to stimulate cell death in human PDAC cell lines (PANC1, MiaPaCa2, CFPAC1, PANC2.03, BxPc3, and CAPAN2), mouse pancreatic cancer-associated stellate cell lines, primary human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, and 60 cancer cell lines (the NCI-60 panel). Genes encoding proteins in cell death and GPCR signaling pathways, as well as those that regulate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, were knocked out, knocked down, or expressed from transgenes in cancer cell lines. JTC801 was administered by gavage to mice with xenograft tumors, C57BL/6 mice with orthographic pancreatic tumors grown from Pdx1-Cre;KRas(G12D/+);Tp53(R172H/+) (KPC) cells, mice with metastases following tail-vein injection of KPC cells, and Pdx-1-Cre;Kras(G12D/+) mice crossed with Hmgb1(flox/flox) mice (KCH mice). Pancreata were collected from mice and analyzed for tumor growth and by histology and immunohistochemistry. We compared gene and protein expression levels between human pancreatic cancer tissues and patient survival times using online R2 genomic or immunohistochemistry analyses. RESULTS: Exposure of human PDAC cell lines (PANC1 and MiaPaCa2) to JTC801 did not induce molecular markers of apoptosis (cleavage of caspase 3 or poly [ADP ribose] polymerase [PARP]), necroptosis (interaction between receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 [RIPK3] and mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase [MLKL]), or ferroptosis (degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 [GPX4]). Inhibitors of apoptosis (Z-VAD-FMK), necroptosis (necrosulfonamide), ferroptosis (ferrostatin-1), or autophagy (hydroxychloroquine) did not prevent JTC801-induced death of PANC1 or MiaPaCa2 cells. The cytotoxic effects of JTC801 in immortalized fibroblast cell lines was not affected by disruption of genes that promote apoptosis (Bax(-/-)/Bak(-/-) cells), necroptosis (Ripk1(-/-), Ripk3(-/-), or Mlkl(-/-) cells), ferroptosis (Gpx4(-/-) cells), or autophagy (Atg3(-/-), Atg5(-/-), Atg7(-/-), or Sqstm1(-/-) cells). We found JTC801 to induce a pH-dependent form cell death (alkaliptosis) in cancer cells but not normal cells (hepatocytes, bone marrow CD34(+) progenitor cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or dermal fibroblasts) or healthy tissues of C57BL/6 mice. JTC801 induced alkaliptosis in cancer cells by activating NF-kappaB, which repressed expression of the carbonic anhydrase 9 gene (CA9), whose product regulates pH balance in cells. In analyses of Cancer Genome Atlas data and tissue microarrays, we associated increased tumor level of CA9 mRNA or protein with shorter survival times of patients with pancreatic, kidney, or lung cancers. Knockdown of CA9 reduced the protective effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on JTC801-induced cell death and intracellular alkalinization in PANC1 and MiaPaCa2 cell lines. Oral administration of JTC801 inhibited growth of xenograft tumors (from PANC1, MiaPaCa2, SK-MEL-28, PC-3, 786-0, SF-295, HCT116, OV-CAR3, and HuH7 cells), orthotropic tumors (from KPC cells), lung metastases (from KPC cells) of mice, and slowed growth of tumors in KCH mice. CONCLUSIONS: In a screen of agents that interact with GPCR pathways, we found JTC801 to induce pH-dependent cell death (alkaliptosis) specifically in cancer cells such as PDAC cells, by reducing expression of CA9. Levels of CA9 are increased in human cancer tissues. JTC801 might be developed for treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract 7: Exosomes or microvesicles that are secreted from cells are considered to play important roles in tumor microenvironment. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), which is induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) in response to hypoxia, is overexpressed in many types of cancer including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We examined the expression level of CA9 in several RCC cell lines and found that the basal level of CA9 was much higher in OSRC-2 cells than in Caki-1, KMRC-1 and 786-O cells. Consistent with the intracellular expression levels, CA9 was abundantly detected in exosomes isolated by ultracentrifugation from OSRC-2 cells. Density gradient centrifugation of OSRC-2 and 786-O exosomes confirmed the co-presence of CA9 with exosomal markers. Upon hypoxia and treatment with CoCl(2), a hypoxia mimic agent, the CA9 level in exosomes was increased for all cell lines. In order to examine the effects of CA9 exosomes on angiogenesis, we generated stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing CA9. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated the uptake of CA9 exosomes by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In vitro angiogenesis assays using HUVEC revealed that CA9 exosomes promoted migration and tube formation. Lastly, MMP2 expression was increased by treatment with CA9 exosomes in HUVEC. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that CA9 exosomes released from hypoxic RCC may enhance angiogenesis in microenvironment, thereby contributing to cancer progression.

Abstract 8: Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors. However, the impact of hypoxia on immune cells within tumor environments remains underexplored. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) is a hypoxia-responsive tumor-associated enzyme. We previously noted that regardless of human CA9 (hCA9) expression, hCA9-expressing mouse renal cell carcinoma RENCA (RENCA/hCA9) presented as a "cold" tumor in syngeneic aged mice. This study delves into the mechanisms behind this observation. Gene microarray analyses showed that RENCA/hCA9 cells exhibited elevated mouse serpinB9, an inhibitor of granzyme B, relative to RENCA cells. Corroborating this, RENCA/hCA9 cells displayed heightened resistance to antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells compared with RENCA cells. Notably, siRNA-mediated serpinB9 knockdown reclaimed this sensitivity. In vivo tests showed that serpinB9 inhibitor administration slowed RENCA tumor growth, but this effect was reduced in RENCA/hCA9 tumors, even with adjunctive immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Further, inducing hypoxia or introducing the mouse CA9 gene upregulated serpinB9 expression, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of the mouse CA9 gene inhibited the hypoxia-induced induction of serpinB9 in the original RENCA cells. Supernatants from RENCA/hCA9 cultures had lower pH than those from RENCA, suggesting acidosis. This acidity enhanced serpinB9 expression and T cell apoptosis. Moreover, coculturing with RENCA/hCA9 cells more actively prompted T cell apoptosis than with RENCA cells. Collectively, these findings suggest hypoxia-associated CA9 not only boosts serpinB9 in cancer cells but also synergistically intensifies T cell apoptosis via acidosis, characterizing RENCA/hCA9 tumors as "cold."

Abstract 9: Stress-adaptive mechanisms enable tumour cells to overcome metabolic constraints under nutrient and oxygen shortage. Aspartate is an endogenous metabolic limitation under hypoxic conditions, but the nature of the adaptive mechanisms that contribute to aspartate availability and hypoxic tumour growth are poorly understood. Here we identify GOT2-catalysed mitochondrial aspartate synthesis as an essential metabolic dependency for the proliferation of pancreatic tumour cells under hypoxic culture conditions. In contrast, GOT2-catalysed aspartate synthesis is dispensable for pancreatic tumour formation in vivo. The dependence of pancreatic tumour cells on aspartate synthesis is bypassed in part by a hypoxia-induced potentiation of extracellular protein scavenging via macropinocytosis. This effect is mutant KRAS dependent, and is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1A) and its canonical target carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9). Our findings reveal high plasticity of aspartate metabolism and define an adaptive regulatory role for macropinocytosis by which mutant KRAS﻿ tumours can overcome nutrient deprivation under hypoxic conditions.

Abstract 10: Despite the increasing number of newly identified renal neoplasms, the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can usually be reached with careful histologic examination and a limited immunohistochemical (IHC) panel. Clear cell, papillary, chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma account for more than 90% of renal neoplasia in adults, and sophisticated ancillary tools are usually unnecessary. Renal tumors with entity-defining genetic alterations may ultimately require molecular confirmation via cytogenetics or sequencing technologies, such as RCC with TFE3, TFEB, or ALK gene rearrangements, or TFEB amplified RCC. In fumarate hydratase-deficient and succinate dehydrogenase-deficient RCC, highly specific IHC markers can strongly suggest the diagnosis. In the metastatic setting, PAX8 and carbonic anhydrase 9 are among the most helpful markers for confirming RCC and clear cell type, respectively; however, caution should be exercised in the absence of a current or historical renal mass. In diagnostically challenging cases, such as renal eosinophilic tumors with low-grade nuclear features, or infiltrative high-grade tumors, careful examination coupled with a judicious panel of IHC markers usually resolves the diagnosis. This review offers concise algorithms for diagnosis of kidney neoplasia with the latest recognized, provisional, and emerging entities to daily pathology practice.

Abstract 11: Hypoxia is a crucial factor in tumour aggressiveness and its treatment resistance, particularly in human brain cancer. Tumour resistance against radiation- and chemo- therapy is facilitated by oxygenation reduction at tumour areas. HIF-1alpha regulated genes are mostly responsible for this type of resistance. Among these genes, carbonic anhydrase isoform 9 (CA9) is highly overexpressed in many types of cancer especially in high grade brain cancer like GBM. CA IX contributes to tumour environment acidification by catalyzing the carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons, leading to the acquisition of metastasic phenotypes and chemoresistance to weakly basic anticancer drugs and therefore to inadequate application of radio-therapeutic or chemotherapeutic anti-cancer treatment strategies. Inhibition of this enzymatic activity by application of specific chemical CA9 inhibitors (sulphonamide derivative compounds) or indirect inhibitors like HIF-1alpha inhibitors (chetomin) or molecular inhibitors like CA9-siRNA leads to reversion of these processes, leading to the CA9 functional role inhibition during tumourigenesis. Hypoxia significantly influences the tumour microenvironment behaviour via activation of genes involved in the adaptation to the hypoxic stress. It also represents an important cancer prognosis indicator and is associated with aggressive growth, malignant progression, metastasis and poor treatment response. The main objective in malignant GBM therapy is either to eradicate the tumour or to convert it into a controlled, quiescent chronic disease. Sulfonamide derivative compounds with CA9 inhibitory characteristics represent one of the optimal treatment options beside other CA9 inhibitory agents or chemical inhibitory compounds against its main regulating transcription factor which is the hypoxia induced HIF-1alpha when applied against human cancers with hypoxic regions like GBM, bearing potential for an effective role in human brain tumour therapeutic strategies. Glycolytic inhibitors, when added in controlled doses under hypoxia, lead to a reduced accumulation of HIF-1alpha and can function as indirect hypoxia regulated genes inhibitors like CA9. These may be used as alternative or in conjunction with other direct inhibitors like the sulphonamide derivate compounds, chetomin or specific siRNAs, or other different chemical compounds possessing similar functionality making them as optimal tools for optimized therapy development in cancer treatment, especially against human brain cancer. Further experimental analysis towards the tumour stage specific inhibitory CA9 characteristics determination are necessary to find the optimal therapeutic solutions among the different available modalities; whether they are direct or indirect chemical, molecular or natural inhibitors to be able to set up successful treatment approaches against the different human tumour diseases.

Abstract 12: The development of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is strongly linked to the presence of germline mutations in more than 15 predisposing genes. Among them, germline and somatic VHL mutations account for ~10% of all cases. In contrast with SDHA and SDHB immunohistochemistries that are routinely used to validate SDHx gene mutations, there is no such tool available for VHL mutations. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether CA9 immunostaining could be used as a tool to predict the presence or validate the pathogenicity of VHL gene mutations in paraganglioma. Immunohistochemistry for CA9 was performed on 207 tumors. A retrospective series of 100 paragangliomas with known mutation status for paraganglioma susceptibility genes was first investigated. Then, a prospective series of 107 paragangliomas was investigated for CA9 immunostaining followed by germline and/or somatic genetic testing of all paraganglioma susceptibility genes by next-generation sequencing. Cytosolic CA9 protein expression was heterogeneous in the different samples. However, we observed that a membranous CA9 staining was almost exclusively observed in VHL-related cases. Forty two of 48 (88%) VHL-mutated samples showed a CA9 membranous immunostaining. Positive cells were either isolated, varying from 1 or 2 cells (5% of cases) to 10-20 cells per tumor block (35% of cases), grouped in areas of focal positivity representing between 1 and 20% of the tissue section (35% of cases), or widely distributed on 80-100% of the tumor sections (25% of samples). In contrast, 142/159 (91%) of non-VHL-mutated tumors presented no membrane CA9 localization. Our results demonstrate that VHL gene mutations can be predicted or validated reliably by an easy-to-perform and low-cost immunohistochemical procedure. CA9 immunohistochemistry on paragangliomas will improve the diagnosis of VHL-related disease, which is important for the surveillance and therapeutic management of paraganglioma patients, and in case of germline mutation, their family members.

Abstract 13: BACKGROUND: Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a prevalent kidney cancer for which long-term survival rates are abysmal, though immunotherapies are showing potential. Not yet clinically vetted are bispecific T cell engagers (BTEs) that activate T cell-mediated cancer killing through intercellular synapsing. Multiple BTE formats exist, however, with limited cross-characterizations to help optimize new drug design. Here, we developed BTEs to treat ccRCC by targeting carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) while characterizing the persistent BTE (PBTE) format and comparing it to a new format, the persistent multivalent T cell engager (PMTE). These antibody therapies against ccRCC are developed as both recombinant and synthetic DNA (synDNA) medicines. METHODS: Antibody formatting effects on binding kinetics were assessed by flow cytometry and intercellular synaptic strength assays while potency was tested using T-cell activation and cytotoxicity assays. Mouse models were used to study antibody plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics, as well as antitumor efficacy as both recombinant and synDNA medicines. Specifically, three models using ccRCC cell line xenografts and human donor T cells in immunodeficient mice were used to support this study. RESULTS: Compared with a first-generation BTE, we show that the PBTE reduced avidity, intercellular synaptic strength, cytotoxic potency by as much as 33-fold, and ultimately efficacy against ccRCC tumors in vivo. However, compared with the PBTE, we demonstrate that the PMTE improved cell avidity, restored intercellular synapses, augmented cytotoxic potency by 40-fold, improved tumor distribution pharmacokinetics by 2-fold, and recovered synDNA efficacy in mouse tumor models by 20-fold. All the while, the PMTE displayed a desirable half-life of 4 days in mice compared with the conventional BTE's 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS: With impressive efficacy, the CA9-targeted PMTE is a promising new therapy for advanced ccRCC, which can be effectively delivered through synDNA. The highly potent PMTE format itself is a promising new tool for future applications in the multispecific antibody space.

Abstract 14: INTRODUCTION: Aggressive cancers commonly ferment glucose to lactic acid at high rates, even in the presence of oxygen. This is known as aerobic glycolysis, or the "Warburg Effect." It is widely assumed that this is a consequence of the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes. Oncogenic drivers can increase the expression of most proteins in the glycolytic pathway, including the terminal step of exporting H(+) equivalents from the cytoplasm. Proton exporters maintain an alkaline cytoplasmic pH, which can enhance all glycolytic enzyme activities, even in the absence of oncogene-related expression changes. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that increased uptake and fermentative metabolism of glucose could be driven by the expulsion of H(+) equivalents from the cell. RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we stably transfected lowly glycolytic MCF-7, U2-OS, and glycolytic HEK293 cells to express proton-exporting systems: either PMA1 (plasma membrane ATPase 1, a yeast H(+)-ATPase) or CA-IX (carbonic anhydrase 9). The expression of either exporter in vitro enhanced aerobic glycolysis as measured by glucose consumption, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate. This resulted in an increased intracellular pH, and metabolomic analyses indicated that this was associated with an increased flux of all glycolytic enzymes upstream of pyruvate kinase. These cells also demonstrated increased migratory and invasive phenotypes in vitro, and these were recapitulated in vivo by more aggressive behavior, whereby the acid-producing cells formed higher-grade tumors with higher rates of metastases. Neutralizing tumor acidity with oral buffers reduced the metastatic burden. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, cancer cells which increase export of H(+) equivalents subsequently increase intracellular alkalization, even without oncogenic driver mutations, and this is sufficient to alter cancer metabolism towards an upregulation of aerobic glycolysis, a Warburg phenotype. Overall, we have shown that the traditional understanding of cancer cells favoring glycolysis and the subsequent extracellular acidification is not always linear. Cells which can, independent of metabolism, acidify through proton exporter activity can sufficiently drive their metabolism towards glycolysis providing an important fitness advantage for survival.

Abstract 15: Cancer cells in acidic tumor regions are aggressive and a key therapeutic target, but distinguishing between acid-exposed and hypoxic cells is challenging. Here, we use carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) antibodies to mark acidic areas in both hypoxic and respiring tumor areas, along with an HRE-GFP reporter for hypoxia, to isolate distinct cell populations from 3D tumor spheroids. Transcriptomic analysis of CA9-positive, hypoxia-negative cells highlights enriched fatty acid desaturase activity. Inhibiting or silencing stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) induces ferroptosis in CA9-positive acidic cancer cells and delays mouse tumor growth, an effect enhanced by omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Using acid-exposed cancer cells and patient-derived tumor organoids, we show that SCD1 inhibition increases acidic cancer cell reliance on external mono-unsaturated fatty acids, depriving hypoxic cells of essential resources. This bystander effect provides unbiased evidence for a lack of full overlap between hypoxic and acidic tumor compartments, highlighting a rationale for targeting desaturase activity in cancer.

Abstract 16: Frequently observed phenotypes of tumours include high metabolic activity, hypoxia and poor perfusion; these act to produce an acidic microenvironment. Cellular function depends on pH homoeostasis, and thus, tumours become dependent on pH regulatory mechanisms. Many of the proteins involved in pH regulation are highly expressed in tumours, and their expression is often of prognostic significance. The more acidic tumour microenvironment also has important implications with regard to chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic interventions. In addition, we review pH-sensing mechanisms, the role of pH regulation in tumour phenotype and the use of pH regulatory mechanisms as therapeutic targets.

Abstract 17: Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) is a transmembrane member of the carbonic anhydrase family. It catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate and a proton, thus enabling tumour cells to maintain a neutral pH despite an acidic microenvironment. CA9 is not expressed in healthy renal tissue but is expressed in most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCC) through HIF-1alpha accumulation driven by hypoxia and inactivation of the VHL gene. CA9 expression can be detected in the tumour by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in blood and tissue by ELISA assay and RT-PCR. It has a 100% diagnostic specificity in solid renal tumours, while ELISA assays on aspiration fluids may help in atypical cysts. Blood-based assays, ELISA for CA9 antigen and RT-PCR for CA9 mRNA are promising for the prognosis and follow-up of localised CCRCC. In metastatic disease, high CA9 expression by IHC was reported to be a powerful prognostic marker with better survival and sensitivity to IL-2, but this is still debated. Almost no data are currently available on the association of CA9 expression and outcome to targeted drugs. The prognostic value of CA9 in CCRCC could be explained by the frequent VHL gene inactivation driving an early activation of the HIF pathway. The poorer prognosis associated with low CA9 expressing tumours could be due to the simultaneous overexpression of EGFR contributing to the activation of AkT and mTOR pathways. Targeting CA9 by inhibitors, radioimmunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies or vaccination is promising and offers new avenues for clinical research.
