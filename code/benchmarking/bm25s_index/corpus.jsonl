{"id":0,"text":"Pilocarpine, sold under the brand name Pilopine HS among others, is a lactone alkaloid originally extracted from plants of the Pilocarpus genus. It is used as a medication to reduce pressure inside the eye and treat dry mouth. As an eye drop it is used to manage angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be performed, ocular hypertension, primary open angle glaucoma, and to constrict the pupil after dilation. However, due to its side effects, it is no longer typically used for long-term management. Onset of effects with the drops is typically within an hour and lasts for up to a day. By mouth it is used for dry mouth as a result of Sjögren syndrome or radiation therapy.\nCommon side effects of the eye drops include irritation of the eye, increased tearing, headache, and blurry vision. Other side effects include allergic reactions and retinal detachment. Use is generally not recommended during pregnancy. Pilocarpine is in the miotics family of medication. It works by activating cholinergic receptors of the muscarinic type which cause the trabecular meshwork to open and the aqueous humor to drain from the eye.\nPilocarpine was isolated in 1874 by Hardy and Gerrard and has been used to treat glaucoma for more than 100 years. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the South American plant Pilocarpus."}

Thalidomide has been used to treat conditions associated with HIV: aphthous ulcers, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, diarrhea, and Kaposi's sarcoma, but increases in HIV viral load have been reported.\nCommon side effects include sleepiness, rash, and dizziness. Severe side effects include tumor lysis syndrome, blood clots, and peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen and carries an extremely high risk of severe, life-threatening birth defects if administered or taken during pregnancy. It causes skeletal deformities such as amelia (absence of legs and/or arms), absence of bones, and phocomelia (malformation of the limbs). A single dose of thalidomide, regardless of dosage, is enough to cause teratogenic effects.\nThalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany, where it was available over-the-counter. When first released, thalidomide was promoted for anxiety, trouble sleeping, \"tension\", and morning sickness. While it was initially thought to be safe in pregnancy, concerns regarding birth defects arose, resulting in its removal from the market in Europe in 1961. The total number of infants severely harmed by thalidomide use during pregnancy is estimated at over 10,000, possibly 20,000, of whom about 40% died around the time of birth. Those who survived had limb, eye, urinary tract, and heart problems. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey, a reviewer at the FDA. The birth defects caused by thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries.\nIt was approved in the United States in 1998 for use as a treatment for cancer.

{"id":34,"text":"Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic piperidine opioid primarily used as an analgesic (pain medication). It is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Its primary clinical utility is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from painful surgeries. Fentanyl is also used as a sedative. Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and ingesting a relatively small quantity can cause overdose. Fentanyl works by activating μ-opioid receptors. Fentanyl is sold under the brand names Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze, among others.\nPharmaceutical fentanyl's adverse effects are similar to those of other opioids and narcotics, including addiction, confusion, respiratory depression (which, if extensive and untreated, may lead to respiratory arrest), drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, hallucinations, delirium, a subset of the latter known as \"narcotic delirium\", narcotic ileus, muscle rigidity, constipation, loss of consciousness, hypotension, coma, and death. Alcohol and other drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin) can synergistically exacerbate fentanyl's side effects. Naloxone (also known as Narcan) can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, but because fentanyl is so potent, multiple doses may be necessary.\nFentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1959 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 pounds) were used in healthcare globally. As of 2017, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine; in 2019, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than a million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\nFentanyl fuels an epidemic of synthetic opioid drug overdose deaths in the United States. From 2011 to 2021, deaths from prescription opioid (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) per year remained stable, while synthetic opioid (primarily fentanyl) deaths per year increased from 2,600 overdoses to 70,601. Since 2018, fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in 2021. Fentanyl constitutes the majority of all drug overdose deaths in the United States since it overtook heroin in 2018. The United States National Forensic Laboratory estimates fentanyl reports by federal, state, and local forensic laboratories increased from 4,697 reports in 2014 to 117,045 reports in 2020. Fentanyl is often mixed, cut, or ingested alongside other drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Fentanyl has been reported in pill form, including pills mimicking pharmaceutical drugs such as oxycodone. Mixing with other drugs or disguising as a pharmaceutical makes it difficult to determine the correct treatment in the case of an overdose, resulting in more deaths. In an attempt to reduce the number of overdoses from taking other drugs mixed with fentanyl, drug testing kits, strips, and labs are available. Fentanyl's ease of manufacture and high potency makes it easier to produce and smuggle, resulting in fentanyl replacing other abused narcotics and becoming more widely used."}

{"id":48,"text":"Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used medically for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It is also used as a treatment for depression and in pain management. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist which accounts for most of its psychoactive effects.\nAt anesthetic doses, ketamine induces a state of dissociative anesthesia, a trance-like state providing pain relief, sedation, and amnesia. Its distinguishing features as an anesthestic are preserved breathing and airway reflexes, stimulated heart function with increased blood pressure, and moderate bronchodilation. At lower, sub-anesthetic doses, it is a promising agent for treatment of pain and treatment-resistant depression. As with many antidepressants, the results of a single administration wane with time. \nKetamine is used as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. When used recreationally, it is found both in crystalline powder and liquid form, and is often referred to by users as \"Special K\" or simply \"K\". The long-term effects of repeated use are largely unknown and are an area of active investigation. Liver and urinary toxicity have been reported among regular users of high doses of ketamine for recreational purposes.\nKetamine was first synthesized in 1962, derived from phencyclidine in pursuit of a safer anesthetic with fewer hallucinogenic effects. It was approved for use in the United States in 1970. It has been regularly used in veterinary medicine and was extensively used for surgical anesthesia in the Vietnam War.

It is a widely available over-the-counter drug sold under various brand names, including Tylenol and Panadol.\nParacetamol relieves pain in both acute mild migraine and episodic tension headache. At a standard dose, paracetamol slightly reduces fever; it is inferior to ibuprofen in that respect, and the benefits of its use for fever are unclear, particularly in the context of fever of viral origins.  The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also helps with both conditions where the pain is mild and is recommended as a first-line treatment for them. Paracetamol is effective for post-surgical pain, but it is inferior to ibuprofen. The paracetamol/ibuprofen combination provides further increase in potency and is superior to either drug alone. The pain relief paracetamol provides in osteoarthritis is small and clinically insignificant. The evidence in its favor for the use in low back pain, cancer pain, and neuropathic pain is insufficient.\nIn the short term, paracetamol is safe and effective when used as directed. Short term adverse effects are uncommon and similar to ibuprofen, but paracetamol is typically safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term use. Paracetamol is also often used in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Chronic consumption of paracetamol may result in a drop in hemoglobin level, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and abnormal liver function tests. The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is three to four grams. Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure. Paracetamol poisoning is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.\nParacetamol was first made in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse or possibly in 1852 by Charles Frédéric Gerhardt.

Amphetamine was discovered as a chemical in 1887 by Lazăr Edeleanu, and then as a drug in the late 1920s. It exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use.\nThe first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine, a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, dextroamphetamine, or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems.\nAt therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time, fatigue resistance, decreased appetite, elevated heart rate, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.\nAmphetamine belongs to the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, MDMA, and methamphetamine. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulators, specifically phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while N-methylphenethylamine is a positional isomer of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the methyl group."}
{"id":110,"text":"Flutamide, sold under the brand name Eulexin among others, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) which is used primarily to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like acne, excessive hair growth, and high androgen levels in women. It is taken by mouth, usually three times per day.\nSide effects in men include breast tenderness and enlargement, feminization, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes. Conversely, the medication has fewer side effects and is better-tolerated in women with the most common side effect being dry skin. Diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes can occur in both sexes. Rarely, flutamide can cause liver damage, lung disease, sensitivity to light, elevated methemoglobin, elevated sulfhemoglobin, and deficient neutrophils. Numerous cases of liver failure and death have been reported, which has limited the use of flutamide.\nFlutamide acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), competing with androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to ARs in tissues like the prostate gland. By doing so, it prevents their effects and stops them from stimulating prostate cancer cells to grow. Flutamide is a prodrug to a more active form. Flutamide and its active form stay in the body for a relatively short time, which makes it necessary to take flutamide multiple times per day.\nFlutamide was first described in 1967 and was first introduced for medical use in 1983. It became available in the United States in 1989. The medication has largely been replaced by newer and improved NSAAs, namely bicalutamide and enzalutamide, due to their better efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing frequency (once per day), and is now relatively little-used. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines."}
{"id":111,"text":"Bicalutamide, sold under the brand name Casodex among others, is an antiandrogen medication that is primarily used to treat prostate cancer. It is typically used together with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical removal of the testicles to treat metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To a lesser extent, it is used at high doses for locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) as a monotherapy without castration. Bicalutamide was also previously used as monotherapy to treat localized prostate cancer (LPC), but authorization for this use was withdrawn following unfavorable trial findings. Besides prostate cancer, bicalutamide is limitedly used in the treatment of excessive hair growth and scalp hair loss in women, as a puberty blocker and component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender girls and women, to treat gonadotropin-independent early puberty in boys, and to prevent overly long-lasting erections in men. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects of bicalutamide in men include breast growth, breast tenderness, and hot flashes. Other side effects in men include feminization and sexual dysfunction. Some side effects like breast changes and feminization are minimal when combined with castration. While the medication appears to produce few side effects in women, its use in women is not explicitly approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at this time. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase the likelihood of death from causes other than prostate cancer. Bicalutamide produces abnormal liver changes necessitating discontinuation in around 1% of people. Rarely, it has been associated with cases of serious liver damage, serious lung toxicity, and sensitivity to light. Although the risk of adverse liver changes is small, monitoring of liver function is recommended during treatment.\nBicalutamide is a member of the nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) group of medications. It works by selectively blocking the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It does not lower androgen levels. The medication can have some estrogen-like effects in men when used as a monotherapy due to increased estradiol levels. Bicalutamide is well-absorbed, and its absorption is not affected by food. The elimination half-life of the medication is around one week. It shows peripheral selectivity in animals, but crosses the blood–brain barrier and affects both the body and brain in humans.\nBicalutamide was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bicalutamide is available as a generic medication. The drug is sold in more than 80 countries, including most developed countries. It was at one time the most widely used antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer, with millions of men with the disease having been prescribed it. Although bicalutamide is also used for other indications besides prostate cancer, the vast majority of prescriptions appear to be for treatment of prostate cancer."}
{"id":112,"text":"Pemoline, formerly sold under the brand name Cylert among others, is a stimulant medication which was used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy,- it has since been discontinued in most countries due to rare but serious liver toxicity. The medication was taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include insomnia, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, irritability, and headaches, while rare cases of serious liver damage requiring liver transplantation or causing death have been reported. As a stimulant, Pemoline acts as a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent  via indirect agonism of dopamine receptors.In addition, it shows little activity with respect to norepinephrine, thus minimal to no cardiovascular or sympathomimetic effects in comparison to many other stimulants.\nPemoline was first synthesized in 1913, but its stimulant activity was not discovered until the 1930s, nor used for ADHD until 1975. Between 1997 and 2005, many countries, including the United States, withdrew the drug due to liver toxicity.  However, it remains available in Japan for the treatment of narcolepsy at lower doses than those used for ADHD.

{"id":126,"text":"Desflurane (1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is a highly fluorinated methyl ethyl ether used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Like halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane, it is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) optical isomers (enantiomers). Together with sevoflurane, it is gradually replacing isoflurane for human use, except in economically undeveloped areas, where its high cost precludes its use. It has the most rapid onset and offset of the volatile anesthetic drugs used for general anesthesia due to its low solubility in blood.\nSome drawbacks of desflurane are its low potency, its pungency and its high cost (though at low flow fresh gas rates, the cost difference between desflurane and isoflurane appears to be insignificant). It may cause tachycardia and airway irritability when administered at concentrations greater than 10% by volume.  Due to this airway irritability, desflurane is infrequently used to induce anesthesia via inhalation techniques.\nThough it vaporizes very readily, it is a liquid at room temperature. Anaesthetic machines are fitted with a specialized anaesthetic vaporiser unit that heats liquid desflurane to a constant temperature.  This enables the agent to be available at a constant vapor pressure, negating the effects fluctuating ambient temperatures would otherwise have on its concentration imparted into the fresh gas flow of the anesthesia machine.\nDesflurane, along with enflurane and to a lesser extent isoflurane, has been shown to react with the carbon dioxide absorbent in anesthesia circuits to produce detectable levels of carbon monoxide through degradation of the anesthetic agent.  The CO2 absorbent Baralyme, when dried, is most culpable for the production of carbon monoxide from desflurane degradation, although it is also seen with soda lime absorbent as well. Dry conditions in the carbon dioxide absorbent are conducive to this phenomenon, such as those resulting from high fresh gas flows."}

{"id":148,"text":"Oxybutynin, sold under the brand name Ditropan among others, is an anticholinergic medication primarily used to treat overactive bladder. It is widely considered a first-line therapy for overactive bladder due to its well-studied side effect profile, broad applicability, and continued efficacy over long periods of time. It works similar to tolterodine, darifenacin, and solifenacin, although it is usually preferred over these medications. It is sometimes used off-label for treatment of hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating. It has also been used off-label to treat bedwetting in children, but this use has declined, as it is most likely ineffective in this role. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin.\nCommon side effects include dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, trouble sleeping, and urinary tract infections. Serious side effects may include urinary retention and an increased risk of heat stroke. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied while use in breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is an antimuscarinic and works by blocking the effects of acetylcholine on smooth muscle.\nOxybutynin was approved for medical use in the US in 1975. It is available as a generic medication.

For epilepsy, this includes focal seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In bipolar disorder, lamotrigine has not been shown to reliably treat acute depression in any groups except for the severely depressed; but for patients with bipolar disorder who are not currently symptomatic, it appears to reduce the risk of future episodes of depression. Lamotrigine is also used off label for unipolar depression (major depressive disorder) and depersonalization-derealization disorder.\nCommon side effects include nausea, sleepiness, headache, vomiting, trouble with coordination, and rash. Serious side effects include excessive breakdown of red blood cells, increased risk of suicide, severe skin reaction (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and allergic reactions, which can be fatal. Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, making it chemically different from other anticonvulsants.

{"id":155,"text":"Apomorphine, sold under the brand name Apokyn among others, is a type of aporphine having activity as a non-selective dopamine agonist which activates both D2-like and, to a much lesser extent, D1-like receptors. It also acts as an antagonist of 5-HT2 and α-adrenergic receptors with high affinity. The compound is an alkaloid belonging to nymphaea caerulea, or blue lotus, but is also historically known as a morphine decomposition product made by boiling morphine with concentrated acid, hence the -morphine suffix. Contrary to its name, apomorphine does not actually contain morphine or its skeleton, nor does it bind to opioid receptors. The apo- prefix relates to it being a morphine derivative (\"[comes] from morphine\").\nHistorically, apomorphine has been tried for a variety of uses, including as a way to relieve anxiety and craving in alcoholics, an emetic (to induce vomiting), for treating stereotypies (repeated behaviour) in farmyard animals, and more recently in treating erectile dysfunction. Currently, apomorphine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a potent emetic and should not be administered without an antiemetic such as domperidone. The emetic properties of apomorphine are exploited in veterinary medicine to induce therapeutic emesis in canines that have recently ingested toxic or foreign substances.\nApomorphine was also used as a private treatment of heroin addiction, a purpose for which it was championed by the author William S. Burroughs. Burroughs and others claimed that it was a \"metabolic regulator\" with a restorative dimension to a damaged or dysfunctional dopaminergic system. Despite anecdotal evidence that this offers a plausible route to an abstinence-based mode, no clinical trials have ever tested this hypothesis. A recent study indicates that apomorphine might be a suitable marker for assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption. There is, however, no clinical evidence that apomorphine is an effective and safe treatment regimen for opiate addiction."}

It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 223rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\nDue to a series of deaths due to gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney failure, ketorolac as a pain medication was removed from the German market in 1993. When ketorolac was introduced into Germany, it was often used as an opioid replacement in pain therapy because its side effects were perceived as much less severe, it did not produce any dependence, and a dose was effective for 7–8 hours compared to morphine with 3–4 hours. As a very potent prostaglandin inhibitor, ketorolac diminishes the kidney's own defenses against vasoconstriction-related effects, e.g. during blood loss or high endogenous catecholamine levels."}

Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx.\nIn 2005, the FDA issued a memorandum concluding that risks for serious cardiovascular (CV) events seem to be as great for nonselective NSAIDs as for COX-2–selective agents such as rofecoxib, according to long-term, controlled clinical trials. Based on data up to 2015, the FDA reasserted the likelihood of an increased risk of serious adverse CV events from COX-2–selective and nonselective NSAIDs, dependent on dose and duration.\nIn November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA."}

Despite these safety concerns, haloperidol maintains its status as an essential medication per the World Health Organization's compendium, continually ranking among the most prescribed antipsychotics in clinical practice."}
{"id":243,"text":"Aciclovir, an antiviral guanosine analogue, exhibits its therapeutic efficacy predominantly by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase through its metabolization to aciclovir triphosphate, resulting in the cessation of herpesvirus DNA elongation across Herpes Simplex Virus, varicella-zoster, and CMV prophylaxis post-transplantation. Administerable orally, topically, or intravenously, its pharmacokinetic profile necessitates careful consideration in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function due to potential nephrotoxicity and thrombocytopenia. While demonstrating an acceptable safety margin during gestation and lactation, adverse events such as gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea are common. Its inclusion in the WHO's Essential Medicines list underscores its global pivotal role in antiviral therapy, with its generic accessibility enhancing universal healthcare implementation."}
{"id":244,"text":"Ketorolac, marketed under names such as Toradol, Acular, and Sprix, is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the management of moderate to severe nociceptive pain with a treatment limitation not exceeding six to seven days, varying by country guidelines. Administration routes include oral, nasal, intravenous, intramuscular, and ophthalmic, with onset of analgesia within one hour and duration of efficacy up to eight hours. Its mechanism of action involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), resulting in the attenuation of prostaglandin synthesis, and it possesses ancillary antipyretic properties. Common adverse reactions encompass sedation, vertigo, gastrointestinal discomfort, and emesis, while severe complications may involve gastrointestinal hemorrhage, nephrotoxicity, myocardial infarction, bronchospasm, heart failure, and hypersensitivity reactions. It is contraindicated in later stages of gestation and lactation due to potential fetal and neonatal risks. Despite its initial appeal as a non-opioid analgesic alternative with lower addictive potential, its correlation with significant adverse outcomes such as gastrointestinal and renal sequelae led to market withdrawal in specific regions like Germany. As a robust prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, ketorolac compromises renal autoregulation under conditions of hemodynamic stress or elevated catecholamine states, limiting its utilization in those with underlying renal or cardiovascular vulnerabilities."}
{"id":245,"text":"Temozolomide is a cytotoxic alkylating agent employed primarily in neuro-oncology for the management of high-grade gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma, administered orally or intravenously. The therapeutic action involves DNA methylation at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine, leading to DNA strand breaks and apoptosis, particularly effective in the presence of MGMT promoter methylation, enhancing chemosensitivity. Adverse hematologic effects largely manifest as myelosuppression, including neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia, alongside gastrointestinal disturbances such as emesis and anorexia, dermatological reactions typified by alopecia and rash, and neurological symptoms like convulsions and fatigue. Additionally, temozolomide's synergistic efficacy with PARP inhibitors, notably olaparib, extends its utility in salvage therapy for recalcitrant malignancies like relapsed small cell lung cancer, augmenting its strategic application in oncology pharmacotherapy."}
{"id":246,"text":"Amiloride, marketed as Midamor, is a potassium-sparing diuretic frequently employed adjunctively with thiazide or loop diuretics for managing hypertension and edematous states associated with heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, administered orally. Its pharmacodynamic profile is characterized by inhibition of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) within the late distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct, culminating in attenuated sodium reabsorption and concurrent preservation of potassium levels, manifested as reduced urinary potassium excretion. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicate a two-hour onset of action with a duration spanning approximately 24 hours. Adverse effects predominantly encompass hyperkalemia, pertinent to individuals with renal impairment, advanced age, or diabetes mellitus, along with gastrointestinal disturbances, dermatological reactions, and cephalalgia."}
{"id":247,"text":"Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid derived from Catharanthus roseus, acts as a mitotic inhibitor by binding to tubulin, thus disrupting microtubule assembly and arresting metaphase progression in neoplastic cells. Clinically administered intravenously, it exhibits therapeutic efficacy against malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung carcinoma. Its pharmacological profile is marked by both neuropathic and systemic side effects, including peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, gastrointestinal stasis, and neuromuscular impairments, alongside potential for severe toxicities like myelosuppression and pulmonary compromise. Teratogenic risks contraindicate its use in gravid patients. Owing to its profound neurotoxicity, inadvertent intrathecal administration can precipitate fatal outcomes, underscoring the critical importance of adhering to strict administration protocols. Recognized for its oncologic utility, vincristine remains a cornerstone agent within chemotherapeutic regimens and is listed on the WHO's Essential Medicines index."}
{"id":248,"text":"Gabapentin, a prototypical member of the gabapentinoid class, is extensively utilized in the management of neuropathic pain syndromes, including diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, as well as partial epileptic seizures. Its mechanism of action predominantly involves high-affinity binding to the α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, encoded by the CACNA2D1 gene, thereby attenuating the synaptic release of glutamate and consequent hyperexcitability within central neuronal circuits. Although effective in approximately 30-40% of patients with neuropathic pain, the pharmacodynamic profile necessitates cautious administration, particularly in patients with renal impairment, due to its propensity to induce sedation, dizziness, potential for respiratory depression, and a heightened suicidality risk as classified by the FDA. Gabapentin's pharmacokinetic traits and adverse event profile require vigilant therapeutic monitoring to mitigate risks and optimize clinical outcomes. It continues to be a staple in therapeutic regimens, as evidenced by its status as one of the most prescribed medications in the United States, albeit historical controversies concerning its marketing strategies by the originating pharmaceutical entities."}
{"id":249,"text":"Azelastine functions as a second-generation H1 receptor antagonist with multifaceted applications, notably as a nasal spray for allergic rhinitis and ocular drops for allergic conjunctivitis, while also exhibiting utility in the management of asthma and dermal hypersensitivity reactions via oral administration. Its pharmacodynamics involve rapid onset, with ocular effects manifesting within minutes and intranasal effects appearing within an hour, sustained for up to 12 hours. This antihistaminic agent exerts its therapeutic efficacy by impeding the release of inflammatory mediators, prominently histamine, thus mitigating allergic symptomatology. The adverse effect profile includes cephalalgia, somnolence, dysgeusia, and pharyngitis, with its safety profile during gestation and lactation remaining ambiguous. Azelastine's widespread usage is reflected in its substantial prescription frequency, denoting its significance in the therapeutic landscape."}
{"id":250,"text":"Rofecoxib, a COX-2-selective NSAID, was originally indicated for various arthritic conditions, acute pain, migraines, and dysmenorrhea, until its market withdrawal in 2004 due to augmented cardiovascular (CV) risks, particularly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, linked to prolonged high-dosage utilization. The drug's comparative pharmacodynamic profile achieved specificity towards cyclooxygenase-2 isoform inhibition, theoretically minimizing gastrointestinal mucosal compromise yet correlating with increased thromboembolic events, a risk shared by nonselective NSAIDs per longitudinal clinical evaluation. Despite its market retraction, an orphan drug designation was granted to Tremeau Pharmaceuticals in 2017 for rofecoxib (TRM-201) targeting hemophilic arthropathy (HA), a condition necessitating analgesic intervention devoid of NSAID-induced platelet inhibition or opioid dependency, thereby providing a unique therapeutic niche given the absence of other approved agents for HA in the U.S., a population at risk due to recurrent hemarthroses and its degenerative sequelae."}
{"id":251,"text":"Lamivudine, or 3TC, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with efficacy against HIV-1, HIV-2, and chronic hepatitis B virus. It functions by competitive inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase and hepatitis B virus polymerase, disrupting viral DNA synthesis. Clinically, lamivudine is integral to combination antiretroviral therapy, often co-administered with agents such as zidovudine, dolutegravir, and abacavir, and forms part of post-exposure prophylactic regimens. It is available for oral administration as liquid or tablet formulations, maintaining therapeutic flexibility through its dosing independence from food intake. While generally well-tolerated, adverse effects can include gastrointestinal disturbances, cephalalgia, asthenia, and respiratory symptoms; however, clinicians must vigilantly monitor for hepatotoxicity, lactic acidosis, and hepatitis B exacerbations. Suitable for patients over three months and deemed safe in pregnancy, lamivudine is recognized as an essential medicine, underscoring its pivotal role in antiretroviral pharmacotherapy despite potential genotypic resistance mutations."}

The effects of GRP are mediated through the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. This receptor is a glycosylated, 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor that activates the phospholipase C signaling pathway. The receptor is aberrantly expressed in numerous cancers such as those of the lung, colon, and prostate. An individual with autism and multiple exostoses was found to have a balanced translocation between chromosome 8 and a chromosome X breakpoint located within the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor gene.\nThe transcription factor CREB is a regulator of human GRP-R expression in colon cancer.\nActivation MOR1D‐GRPR heteromers in the spinal cord mediate the common troublesome opioid-induced itch."}

Methylglyoxal is produced naturally as a byproduct of normal biochemistry, but is highly toxic, due to its chemical reactions with proteins, nucleic acids, and other cellular components.   The second detoxification step, in which (R)-S-lactoylglutathione is split into glutathione and D-lactate, is carried out by glyoxalase II, a hydrolase. Unusually, these reactions carried out by the glyoxalase system does not oxidize glutathione, which usually acts as a redox coenzyme. Although aldose reductase can also detoxify methylglyoxal, the glyoxalase system is more efficient and seems to be the most important of these pathways. Glyoxalase I is an attractive target for the development of drugs to treat infections by some parasitic protozoa, and cancer. Several inhibitors of glyoxalase I have been identified, such as S-(N-hydroxy-N-methylcarbamoyl)glutathione.\nGlyoxalase I is classified as a carbon-sulfur lyase although, strictly speaking, the enzyme does not form or break a carbon-sulfur bond.  Rather, the enzyme shifts two hydrogen atoms from one carbon atom of the methylglyoxal to the adjacent carbon atom.  In effect, the reaction is an intramolecular redox reaction; one carbon is oxidized whereas the other is reduced.  The mechanism proceeds by subtracting and then adding protons, forming an enediolate intermediate, rather than by transferring hydrides.  Unusually for a metalloprotein, this enzyme shows activity with several different metals.  Glyoxalase I is also unusual in that it is stereospecific in the second half of its mechanism, but not in the first half.  Structurally, the enzyme is a domain-swapped dimer in many species, although the two subunits have merged into a monomer in yeast, through gene duplication."}

The human HCAR2 gene is located on the long (i.e., \"q\") arm of chromosome 12 at position 24.31 (notated as 12q24.31). Like the two other hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors, HCA1 and HCA3, HCA2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) located on the surface membrane of cells. HCA2 binds and thereby is activated by D-β-hydroxybutyric acid (hereafter termed β-hydroxybutyric acid), butyric acid, and niacin (also known as nicotinic acid). β-Hydroxybutyric and butyric acids are regarded as the endogenous agents that activate HCA2. Under normal conditions, niacin's blood levels are too low to do so: it is given as a drug in high doses in order to reach levels that activate HCA2.\nβ-Hydroxybutyric acid, butyric acid, and niacin have actions that are independent of HCA2. For example: 1) β-hydroxybutyric acid activates free fatty acid receptor 3 and inhibits some histone deacetylases that regulate the expression of various genes, increase mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production, and promote antioxidant defenses; 2) butyric acid activates free fatty acid receptor 2 and like β-hydroxybutyric acid activates free fatty acid receptor 3 and inhibits some histone deacetylases; and 3) niacin is an NAD+ precursor (see nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) which when converted to NAD+ can alter over 500 enzymatic reactions that play key roles in regulating inflammation, mitochondrion functions, autophagy, and apoptosis. Consequently, studies examining the functions of HCA2 based on the actions of butyric acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, niacin, or other HCA2 activators need to provide data indicating that they actually do so by activating HCA2. One commonly used way to do this is to show that the activators have no or reduced effects on Hca2 gene knockout cells or animals (i.e., cells or animals that had their HCa2 genes removed or inactivated) or gene knockdown cells or animals (i.e., cells or animals that had their HCa2 genes ability to express HCA2 greatly reduced). The studies reported here on HCA2 activators focus on those that included experiments in Hca2 gene knockout and/or knockdown cells and animals.\nStudies, done mostly in animals and the cells taken from animals or humans, show or suggest that HCA2 functions to 1) inhibit lipolysis and 2) inhibit inflammation and thereby suppress the development of certain diseases in which inflammation contributes to their development and/or severity. These diseases include: atherosclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, pathological pain (i.e. pain due to the abnormal activation of neurons), mastitis, hepatitis due to heavy alcohol consumption, inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer of the colon, and, possibly, psoriasis and brain damage due to heavy alcohol consumption."}

Because the receptor gene is expressed in several forms, it has many different (pleiotropic) effects in different parts of the body and in the context of different diseases.\nGR is a steroid receptor and thus it's cannonical action is similar to other steroid receptors.

{"id":779,"text":"The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, also known as cholinergic/acetylcholine receptor M3, or the muscarinic 3, is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor encoded by the human gene CHRM3.\nThe M3 muscarinic receptors are located at many places in the body, e.g., smooth muscles, the bladder, the endocrine glands, the exocrine glands, lungs, pancreas and the brain. In the CNS, they induce emesis. Muscarinic M3 receptors are expressed in regions of the brain that regulate insulin homeostasis, such as the hypothalamus and dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem. These receptors are highly expressed on pancreatic beta cells and are critical regulators of glucose homoestasis by modulating insulin secretion. In general, they cause smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions.\nThey are unresponsive to PTX and CTX."}

It is one of the three serine proteases of the chymotrypsin family that are stored in the azurophil granules, and also a member of the peptidase S1 protein family. Cathepsin G plays an important role in eliminating intracellular pathogens and breaking down tissues at inflammatory sites, as well as in anti-inflammatory response."}
{"id":781,"text":"Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HDAC2 gene.  It belongs to the histone deacetylase class of enzymes responsible for the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues at the N-terminal region of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). As such, it plays an important role in gene expression by facilitating the formation of transcription repressor complexes and for this reason is often considered an important target for cancer therapy.\nThough the functional role of the class to which HDAC2 belongs has been carefully studied, the mechanism by which HDAC2 interacts with histone deacetylases of other classes has yet to be elucidated. HDAC2 is broadly regulated by protein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), but biochemical analysis suggests its regulation is more complex (evinced by the coexistence of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in three distinct protein complexes). Essentially, the mechanism by which HDAC2 is regulated is still unclear by virtue of its various interactions, though a mechanism involving p300/CBP-associated factor and HDAC5 has been proposed in the context of cardiac reprogramming.\nGenerally, HDAC2 is considered a putative target for the treatment for a variety of diseases, due to its involvement in cell cycle progression. Specifically, HDAC2 has been shown to play a role in cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma, and stomach cancer."}
{"id":782,"text":"The H1 receptor is a histamine receptor belonging to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is activated by the biogenic amine histamine. It is expressed in smooth muscles, on vascular endothelial cells, in the heart, and in the central nervous system. The H1 receptor is linked to an intracellular G-protein (Gq) that activates phospholipase C and the inositol triphosphate (IP3) signalling pathway. Antihistamines, which act on this receptor, are used as anti-allergy drugs.

Thus, it increases the body's mean arterial blood pressure.\nRenin is not commonly referred to as a hormone, although it has a receptor, the (pro)renin receptor, also known as the renin receptor and prorenin receptor (see also below), as well as enzymatic activity with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I."}
{"id":787,"text":"Histamine H3 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system and to a lesser extent the peripheral nervous system, where they act as autoreceptors in presynaptic histaminergic neurons and control histamine turnover by feedback inhibition of histamine synthesis and release. The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, but probably not limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin.\nThe gene sequence for H3 receptors expresses only about 22% and 20% homology with both H1 and H2 receptors respectively.\nThere is much interest in the histamine H3 receptor as a potential therapeutic target because of its involvement in the neuronal mechanism behind many cognitive disorders and especially its location in the central nervous system."}
