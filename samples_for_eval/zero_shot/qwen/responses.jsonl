{"custom_id": "Naproxen-Ondansetron-Salmeterol-Beta-1 adrenergic receptor_8:zero_shot", "response": "REASON: The drug in question is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) used for bronchospasm in asthma/COPD, such as salmeterol or formoterol. These drugs primarily target beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs but also activate beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, causing side effects like tachycardia. The question specifies the receptor is **predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue** (beta-1 is the dominant adrenergic receptor in the heart) and **to a lesser extent in the cerebral cortex** (beta-1 is also present in brain regions like the cortex). While LABAs are selective for beta-2, their interaction with beta-1 receptors explains cardiac effects. The antiemetic (e.g., ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist) may contribute to cholecystitis via reduced gut motility, but the receptor in focus is beta-1.  \nANSWER: beta-1 adrenergic receptor"}

{"custom_id": "Furosemide-melphalan_0:zero_shot", "response": "REASON: The patient is receiving a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide) and an alkylating agent (e.g., melphalan). Loop diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), which may exacerbate cardiac or neuromuscular side effects of chemotherapy agents. Exertional dyspnea could arise from hypovolemia, arrhythmias, or respiratory muscle weakness due to severe electrolyte disturbances. Documented interactions between loop diuretics and nephrotoxic chemotherapies (e.g., melphalan) highlight the risk of additive renal impairment and electrolyte loss, leading to dyspnea. The loop diuretic is most directly associated with this interaction.  \nANSWER: Furosemide"}
{"custom_id": "Fentanyl-desvenlafaxine_0:zero_shot", "response": "REASON: The question describes a pharmacodynamic interaction between a potent synthetic opioid and another drug that contributes to nervous tension. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, when combined with an opioid, can precipitate acute opioid withdrawal in dependent individuals. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, agitation, and restlessness, which align with \"nervous tension.\" This interaction is pharmacodynamic as naloxone directly blocks opioid receptor activation, counteracting the opioid's effects and inducing withdrawal.\n\nANSWER: Naloxone"}

{"custom_id": "Ondansetron-Pirbuterol_0:zero_shot", "response": "REASON: The question describes a drug interaction between a short-acting \u03b22 agonist used for asthma and a 5-HT3 antagonist antiemetic. Albuterol (salbutamol) is the most commonly used short-acting \u03b22 agonist, while ondansetron is a prototypical 5-HT3 antagonist. Though direct interactions between these classes are not widely documented, the phrasing \"loss of weight interaction\" may imply a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interplay affecting drug efficacy or metabolism. Albuterol is metabolized partially by CYP2D6, and ondansetron is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor, potentially altering albuterol's effects. However, the question specifically asks for the \u03b22 agonist name, not the antiemetic.  \nANSWER: Albuterol"}
